2;"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"
4;Visiting here for 10 days and staying in a condo\nDriving around and found this place\nAte here 2x ( Lunch + Dinner)\nFood was fresh + Tasty\nSushi was great for the price\nShrimp OK but about the same as other buffets\nSesame balls were lite and great\nFor desert they had a coffee taramisu which was rather good
1;Terrible terrible food
4;This is a beautiful theatre with a gorgeous glass front which is great for watching the world go buy while having a coffee.\n\nI have fond memories of coming to this theatre to see the ballet since I was very young. I rather distinctly remember on my 9th birthday vomiting on the stairs during a performance of Cinderella. Ahh memories.\n\nBut this theatre really is lovely. Its the sort of theatre that you get a little dressed up to go to, like people used to do back in the day. I was lucky enough to see a stunning performance of the Nutcracker here in January, which obviously is mostly attributed to Scottish Ballet but the theatre played a huge role also. Everything from the sound to the lighting was fantastic and it really was a magical evening. \n\nThere is a number of bars for you to have a quick tipple during the interval, but you have to be quick out your seat because it gets very busy fast. \n\nTickets can be expensive, but it really attracts some of the better quality shows so it is worth it and it really makes for a nice evening out.
3;I don't quite get this place or why Asians love it, but it is very good :)
4;Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!
2;"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!  I'll list the good and bad separately.\n\nGood:  The sheets were clean, the room was clean, the water was hot, the amenities were good for the price point and the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.\n\nBad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that \""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. \""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  \n\nI suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....\n\nAlso of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter."
3;Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  \nFirst I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.\nAll said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here.
2;Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. \n\nI will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know.
3;The drunken noodles..... Get them now. \n\nThe restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. \n\nPrice 3.5/5 average \nAtmosphere 3/5 \nFood 5/5
0;They look full so I decided to give it a try.  People standing at a Panda Express set up line, order in a foreign language, so it is usually a good sign, that the food is authentic.  But when we order the sweet and sour pork, the lady behind the glass give us All fat pork.  A minute ago, I saw she spooned all lean pork from the same dish to a lady who obviously speak their language.  So that is a big turn-off, I am not coming back again.
0;"Visit was Friday, July 3rd around 5pm.  Tables were very sticky. All of them. Wanted inside and stuck us in an irritating spot next to a white cloth covering crates beneath a TV. Sangria was sour and not fruity. Paper towel dispenser was broken in restroom and area was very dirty.  Didn't have the corned beef and cabbage for \""signature\"" soup! NO Corned beef and cabbage in an Irish restaurant!!!  The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted moldy.  The clam chowder soup was too salty.  The soda bread  was tasteless and dry.  Shepherd's pie was too hot (definitely microwaved) and kind of bland although the meat was like chef boyardee.  Also, the decor was bad, everything they had hung was wrinkled. You can tell they don't really care. Waitress was ok. This place needs new management or someone from corporate to come here and see how terrible this place really is.  Will never return again, ever."
3;Secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Interior is clean and inviting. Seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours. Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that.
2;Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. \n\nI'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games.
2;Jupiter's is a fun place for families with younger kids, but it's not anything special for adults.  The food isn't spectacular, and the pizza is similar to Monical's thin crust pizza if you're curious what to expect.  There's a BIG arcade room with pool tables and video games, but this area gets PACKED if you go at a popular time of day.  I've only been to Jupiter's once, and I haven't really had the desire to go back.  The service was ok, but the atmosphere and food weren't anything special.  We also had a LONG wait to get a table and food.
1;Cirque du Soleil prices without the Cirque du Soleil talent.  I kept waiting to be amazed by people doing things with their bodies that I can't do.  That's why I pay you the big bucks, people!  The costumes and music (of course) are fantastic, though.
3;Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64. \n\nI will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!
1;If you're going long distances, use the Deuce (i.e. from the Strip to Downtown). Otherwise, it's a waste of time and you'd be better off calling a taxi.\n\nFirst, this thing moves incredibly slow, and I have no idea why. When I first took it, it was during heavy traffic, so I made excuses for the bus driver. But the next time, there was no traffic anywhere, and we still went the same speed.\n\nThe whole double decker set up is annoying. Many people carry bags or luggage and carrying them up and down those stairs takes a lot of effort. Plus, if the bus is crowded (which it usually is), you have to fight to get around everyone else. I can see how having the double decker might be thought of as a fun way to see the Strip, but the whole bus is covered in ads, so you're not getting a very good view.\n\nFinally, I didn't really like the way I was treated when I was trying to board. There was an employee at the bus stop that was instructing people how to get on the bus (is that normal?). He asked if I had a pass or something, and when I said I did not, he told me I couldn't get on! I had two dollars, so I wasn't sure what the problems was. He got slightly indignant and told me I could only board if I had exact change. Which I did.\n\nI can see how a lot of tourists are idiots and that guy probably does need to be there, but it pissed me off. I could read all the signs plastered all over the bus stop, not to mention all over the bus.
2;Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \n\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P
2;I was so excited to try this place out. I came here for dinner and it was grand opening. When we enter the staff was just sitting and one of them got up to assist up.  This place is clean and the staff was friendly. Very patient as we decided on what to order. I'm a huge fan of chow fun (fried thick rice noodles) so I went ahead and order that. My friend order sweet and sour chicken. Our food came out and timely manner. My noodles were very tough are hard to chew.  Which is not good start. They're suppose to be soft. Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm. I will definitely try it again.
1;Woodmans is the grocery store of the damned.  The produce is attrocious and nasty.  The lines are always way too long.  It seems dirty.  Its unpleasant in so many ways.  It takes forever to shop there.  Its cheap, but I'd rather pay a few extra cents for a more pleasant grocery store.
2;This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.
3;With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. \nAll in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive.
1;This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied.
1;What do you do when Coca is packed? Well, sadly, the answer for us didn't lie at Mauramori, as much as we've tried over the past year. \n\nThe food here is fine, but that's really it. It's a touch above what you would expect at a run-of-the-mill diner, but nothing more. \n\nThe coffee is probably Green Mountain or whatever bulk option you'd expect to have somewhere that doesn't care too much about it. There are no fresh juices or other creative beverage options that can enhance your breakfast.\n\nThe deal breaker for us was the apathetic speed of service. The servers are friendly, it just seems like they have no urgency to do anything. Our food routinely came out 10 minutes later than expect all while the place wasn't even full.
3;Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend
4;Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \n\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!
0;Susan started out great and helped with my green pool problem.  Then she stopped coming and did not return my calls or texts.  I paid Susan for a month, and possibly a month and a half for which I got no service.  When I asked for my money back I did not get a reply.
0;"We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's \""Top Docs\"" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended."
2;"It's hard to complain about this place given the price I got it for! \n**Warning** This is a long review, there is a lot to break down.\n\nB -- S\n-- Grandparents have an Interval International timeshare so they booked this place for a week for me\n-- 2 br suite really means 2 adjointed rooms (1 being a jr suite & the other being a regular suit w/ patio)\n-- Located about 10 mins from The Las Vegas Strip\n-- Plenty of free parking and shaded spots\n-- 24 hour pool, say what! BBQ grills available for use\n-- Exercise room\n-- Free shuttle\n-- Paid wireless $10 - $30 (I forget the exact price for how much)\n\nOK, so this place isn't the \""gem of Las Vegas.\"" Let's just put that out there! For what it is, it's actually a decent place. My Grammie got me a 2 bedroom suite for a week for under $400. If you can find a place to sleep 6 - 10 people for that amount, let me know! And if it's in old town Las Vegas, no thank you. You can see the sign as you drive down Tropicana, just hang a left and there it is on the left side.\n\nSo let's talk about service. The front desk was very friendly, let us check in a little bit early. And took care of anything we needed but let me tell you I've done Las Vegas more than a few times, so my group didn't need much. Housekeeping happens like after a few days so we checked in Tuesday and got our rooms cleaned on Friday/Saturday. In addition to cleaning our rooms, we received plenty of towels, blankets, pillows on demand.\n\nThe room was decent. It's not the Ritz Carlton by no means. My GF & I shared the single jr suite room. It had a decent size closet, dresser, & bathroom. The bathroom was cool, nothing special. The shower did have a nice size bathtub so you could take a relaxing bath. Our toilet clogged up but they sent someone right up and it was good for the rest of the week. The bed was pretty comfortable, pillows and blankets better than a cheap motel. The AC worked awesome and kept both of the rooms very cool. It was nice to have a mini kitchen with a fridge for our stuff and a sink. We also had cups and plates. I was pretty pleased with the room in general.\n\nOur friends shared the adjointed room next door. It had almost a full kitchen with oven and microwave, a dining table plus sofa sleeper. The balcony patio was cool but it faced the road instead of the pool. The full size fridge came in handy for supplies and food. Oh yeah, washer and dryer plus complimentary laundry soap! We all did some laundry!\n\nThe pool was NOT very clean. The hot tub had a whole crap load of leaves in there. I wasn't impressed with the pool but the 24 hours was nice. We didn't really take advantage of it though.\n\nThe exercise room was decent. It had a stationary bike, treadmill and stairmaster (I think). It also had a full body work out machine that you could do all the basic exercises with weights. They do stock towels there for you and your sweat which was nice.\n\nHonestly since I had a rental car, the distance from the strip was just fine. If I wanted to do Las Vegas on the strip with no rental car, I wouldn't stay here. My friends used the shuttle and you're not getting anywhere fast on that thing. In addition it takes a while to get from point A to point B. \n\nAll in all I would rate this place at around 3.5 stars. It's better than an average motel and it's pretty cheap and decent! I will say that I didn't really hear any neighbors or anything but I wasn't in my room from 7pm to 7am, lol. I was in Las Vegas for the Electronic Daisy Carnival!"
2;Not worth it. Only upside is there weren't too many people there. For such a nice hotel, the food was off. They did have crabs but everything else was alright. Servers were attentive but like I said, weren't too many people. Maybe since it was a weeknight and after the holidays. I'd spend the extra few bucks and dine at Aria, The M, or Cosmo.
2;"I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \""Wilmar\"") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out."
1;"Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a \""drink\"". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's \""filtered\"". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied \""it's the same\"". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants on Bell Rd."
3;"I have only been to MADCAP once, to see \""Until the Light Takes Us\"" - a documentary about KVLT Norwegian Black Metal. I am very excited to have a theater playing REAL independent films and cult classics nearby. I frequently visited Chandler Cinemas to see films put on by Midnight Movie Mamacita - Cannibal Holocaust, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Re-animator, Black Christmas.. etc. I was very disappointed to see that theater go. When I found out that she'd been relocated to continue the tradition at MADCAP, I rejoiced. I look forward to seeing many movies here in the future."
4;This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!
0;Ummm...Lainie B. or Larnia B. needs to take this rating as constructive criticism and do something about it, instead of calling me names and posting it on Yelp. If you can't handle the criticism, hunny, learn to give good service. I guess Man vs. Food did a good job featuring the crawfish, but not the employees!
0;Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get.
1;I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill
3;I am a frequent customer of this establishment and I appreciate the quality of their beer and the consistency of good service in the bar area. I have only dined in the main seating area twice, and one time it resulted in a beer bath for my wife and infant son but hey, que sera sera right? My overall experience with GB has been positive. Food is good quality but overpriced in my opinion. I tend to take advantage of their happy hour specials if possible. I have had a couple snafus regarding my order, one in particular where my dinner salad came after the entree, but they comped the salad and apologized, no big deal. My go to brew is the hefeweizen, you will not be disappointed with its banana-clovey smoothness. Cheers!
2;If you like guns this is your place. I didn't know if I would like guns or not and found out I don't. We went on a Monday morning which meant no lines no wait. I got the ladies package which included 10 rounds of a handgun and 10 rounds with a pink ak-47 and a free t-shirt.\n\nThey give you headphones and eye glasses. The instructor was nice, cautious, knowledgeable, and gave me a few minutes of instructions on how to shoot each. They also let you choose your target. I was defintely scared as crap upon hearing the guns go off and really didnt' want to finish. But I did and was proud of myself at the end. My husband loves this place, its really popular to visit.
0;They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.
2;"Burger Bar is just ok. The veggie burger option isn't tasty. I'd much prefer a Boca Burger over Burger Bar's version. The menu describe the veggie burger as \"" This burger will flirt with your taste buds and delight your palate with its intriguing combination of whole grains, brown rice, onions, soy, cheese, mushroom, garlic and special spices.\"" Um, no. More like mushy rice mess that sends my taste buds packing. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are delicious. One of the people in our party ordered the kobe beef/foie gras burger (aka Rossini), which was just ok. I seriously doubt it was worth the $60 price tag, but it came with a free dessert. We chose the chocolate burger, which is a warm donut (as the bun) with chocolate ganache as the meat patty and a slice of jellied passionfruit as a cheese slice. This was awesome. I would come back JUST for the dessert burgers."
0;"I've been coming to the restaurant regularly for the past week. The food is delicious, definitely recommend Kao Mun Kai Tod. The food deserves a better review but it is the horrible customer service that made me give this restaurant a one star.\n\nI came in for lunch and it was very busy, so I decided to wave at the waiter and said \""excuse me\"". The man with attitude came up to me mocking my waving gesture and said \""I can see you and you don't have to do that\"". This is the first time in my life I've ever seen a waiter getting offended because a customer tried getting their attention by waving and saying excuse me. As a customer I must say I was truly offended, Mr. Attitude came to pick up the menus after we have ordered our food. As a concerned customer I reminded him that his job was a waiter and that's not the attitude he should have. \n\nAfter speaking to a lady who appears to be the manager, she told me something along the line that \""waving to a waiter is unacceptable in Britain and this is not how it works around here\"". I then apologized to her for losing my temper at their employee and came to a conclusion that customer service is non existence in this particular restaurant. It's a shame. Really."
0;We were staying at the Luxor and figured we would try the buffet. Big mistake...the food was gross, there was not much of a variety, and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night. \n\nThe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive.
3;I don't have a whole lot of experience with liquor stores, but have always been pleased here.  The staff are always nice, helpful, and non-intrusive.\n\nI once went with my boyfriend, who expressed a desire for a certain beer that they didn't have.  The dude behind the counter immediately said that they would order it.  Lo and behold, the next time we went, there it was.  We proceeded to buy lots of it.  Everything after that is kind of a blur.
0;Not sure why it's called a cantina. The bar had 8 different tequilas. I asked the Bartender why they didn't have the shelves stocked and her reply was they were cutting back on tequila?????\nI ordered a burger that was advertised as a 1/2 pound burger. I ordered it and to be cooked medium rare.\nWell, when the burger was delivered the patty of mystery meat appeared to have been 1/4 lb at best before cooking, surely not a 1/2 lb burger and it was cooked well done. This was our 2nd time dining and it will be our last. From the looks of the selection on the shelves and the fact that we were the only one's there for lunch they appear to be another doomed restaurant. excuse me Cantina
3;the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great
2;"SkinnyFats is located in an awkward, small office park on Dean Martin near Sunset with minimal parking and minimal space inside, so if you're planning on a weekday lunch be prepared for a bit of a crowd and nowhere to park. The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.\n\nSo as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.\n\nThe truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon."
3;"Thai is one of my favorite cuisines - it has a unique and delicate balance of spice with flavor. Siam Thai just nails it with its signature Pad Thai. It's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had. I'd also recommend  the Iced Thai Tea, as it's is a great accompaniment to the meal. The Panang Curry is also good, though, not the best.\n\nThe restaurant isn't exactly in the most \""happening\"" places of Glendale, but the decor is tastefully done - distinctive elephant shaped chairs, for example, complete with Thai music. \n\nThe service was good and prompt., and can be even better if they have more waiters. \n\nIn summary, if you like Thai, you'll love Siam Thai!"
0;I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.
1;Their service is comparable to the local hole in the wall, and my local Chinese place has better tasting food (MSG anyone?). I truly felt like I was in main land China since, none of their staff members spoke English properly (except for the hostess). \n\nOverall the food was mediocre, though the spare ribs were pretty good but the services and food were overly priced. It would have been nice to have a full bar instead of being told that we should go across the hall to Emeril's ...
1;Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer.
3;Nice place to hang out and grab some food and drink.  I like to sit at the bar.  My favorite is the hot chick chicken sandwich.  I love their skinny crispy fries.
3;The atmosphere and ambience here is unbelievable. Elegant and classy with a distinctive southwestern look and feel.I started off with French Onion soup. Great flavor and aroma.  I had the porterhouse. A good cut that was seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare. A nice side of mixed sauces accompanied the steak.The fries I ordered were the only weak point of the meal. I expected hand cut steak fries and got what seemed to be overdone frozen Ore-Ida shoestring fries. Oh the house bread was killer. Individually baked buttery brioche loaves with a touch of sea salt on to. I was stuffed and passed on dessert but the cappuccino was top notch. Servers friendly and on point from start to finish.
4;"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!\n\nThis is the third time we've gone and have to say that from start to finish, everything is tasty fresh and the atmosphere is really great.  Hubby and I could probably eat here every weekend.  We took the kids last night (big sushi eaters) and this is their favorite place too.\n\nWe always start with the Edemame 3 ways - So good.  Its ot your run of the mill edemame.  One is lightly tossed in a southwest spice salt, one is in a soy type marinade and the 3rd is in a spicy aioli.  It lasted maybe 5 minutes.  We then asked to try the Crab Puffs - WOW.  They came right out of the fryer and were really hot but we were all burning ourselves to try and eat them because the taste was so good.\n\nSecond round consisted of their Bonzai sashimi's.  We ordered double orders of all three - Seared Tuna, Yellowtail. and Salmon.  They are all very different and the marinades plus the different salads they came with really compliment the sashimi.  The Seared Tuna is coated with ground pepper in a soy type sauce.  The salmon is paired with finely diced apples and nuts, and the yellowtail has a very thinly slided jalapeno plus another awesome sauce.  All 3 double orders were eaten so fast, not even our waiter Summer could believe it.\n\nFor rolls, we ordered the Southwest Ceviche, the Desert Rose (YUM), the Desperado (Yum with a little heat), the Vegas Roll (AWESOME) and the crowd pleaser the Country Fried Chicken Roll.  It seems a little wrong to be eating a non-sushi type roll in a sushi restaurant (we're a bit purist at times) but you can't help loving that roll -- served with a BBQ sauce you want to bath in...\n\nMartini's are great and my favorite is the Sheso Sexy (get it???) - it tastes like a cherry kiddie drink.  Hubby loves the Dirty Harry (Dirty Martini) which was really perfectly balanced.  \n\nI have no idea what the bad reviews were about - and if any of that did happen you should try this place again.  I have always found the waitstaff to be really really attentive - Summer has taken care of us 2 or 3 times and she's great.  They will take care of you will good food, good drink and good times.  I'm not a 5 star type person but this place really deserves it.  \n\nOne of the plaques on their wall had a great saying that I leave you with:  \""Man who steals wife's sushi gets no piece at home\""   Remember that, gentlemen!!"
4;One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!
1;The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again.
4;Dr. Savitsky and her staff are simply amazing. Very stress free environment, made me feel like part of the family.\nI had 2 crowns and a filling in a single visit. \nMy former Dentist had trouble numbing me up, Dr. Savitsky had no problem.\n I'm glad the office staff is considerate enough of the patients that manage ou to get to our appointments on time. \nI highly recommend this office to everyone I know.\nI wish I could give more then five stars!
1;Wow. Now I remember why I never cared much for Butterfield's. We had a good experience about a month ago, motivating us to return. Today, our experience could best be described as stressful.\n\nWe checked in early on a Sunday, largely beating the rush. As a party of six, however, we still had a 25 minute wait. Not bad. A half hour came and went, so we checked to see how much longer it would be. They indicated we had already been seated. Quite a surprise to us as you can imagine. \n\nWe were promised we would be next. Another 25 minutes came and went. Another large party was seated. Then, finally, us. Without apology. \n\nService was adequate. The specialty pancakes were fine, but two omelets we ordered were quite disappointing. \n\nA simple genuine apology for the seating screw up would have gone a long way. Or at least then serve us something exceptional.  Treating customers so poorly, whether a result of complacency or arrogance, is how seemingly invincible restaurants like Butterfield's find a path to failure.
3;You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
1;We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.
0;Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service. Technician never looked me in the eye and was turned away from me joking and yakking it up with her colleagues. \nThe place looked like a bomb went off. \nI have been getting decent to good service till now. But this will be the end if Eddy is not available.\nAlso: everyone of the technicians picks up or checks their personal phone.... While working on your feet or hands.
0;"It's sad that once I logged on to leave a review I see the 5 star review I left one year ago for this place. It used to be my favorite until Saturday night. We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \""very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\"" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \""Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\"" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh. What's really bad about it is we're locals so when the tourists aren't there who does she think Le Thai is serving?"
1;I had lunch here Thursday. I have eaten here before and loved it but this time, not sure I would go back. The waitress came over to take our order and when I said I was going to order a salad but looked down at the menu she quickly said she had another table and would come back. Off she went. We had our water glasses refilled. The gal filled one glass over the top of one of our handbags, a Prada. She didn't seem to care and almost apologized as she casually went to get at towel but didn't hand us one. We cleaned up the water on the outside and inside of the handbag with our napkins. After searching for and flagging down the waitress to order our lunch, I ordered the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was ok but the turkey appeared to be packaged sliced lunch meat chopped into squares. It was awful. The bread on the salad was extremely tough and chewy. As we were eating, we watched, who I think was the manager, clean the lights over the bar as people sat there eating their lunch. The dust was flying everywhere and also landed on the bar. From our table we could see the dust because the bar was higher.  She didn't wipe the bar off but rather went around and began inspecting the clean glasses. One man was sitting there with his lunch and a glass of water. She cleaned the light next to him anyway. There also seemed to be something going on between two of the gals in the dining area. Not impressed this time around.
4;Stopped in here today for a quick cut. After reading many other yelp reviews (all 5 stars) I figured I would give it a try. Got exactly what I asked for and for a great price too! Will definitely be going here from now on.
1;First time at a cicis, not impressed. We paid the extra $8 for their garlic parmasan and buffalo wings...they were not very good, for the quality, they should, have been included in the buffet.  Good place for kids to eat a slice but not much of a selection.
4;Best chicken in town love this place I eat here about twice a week definitely recommend it to all my friends =)
3;World of Beer has a selection that goes on for days! We didn't get food this time, but will definitely return to try some - the pretzel they have looks amazing! We stopped in for some drinks on the 4th of July and were pleased with the service and atmosphere.  This is a great place on Mill Ave. for people watching and great drinks!
2;The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The salsa tasted like spicy tomato soup, the tortillas were hard, but I had a veggie fajita and they brought out beef, I am vegan so had to ask for just veggies but when the veggies came out they were good lots of variety, broccoli, squash, zucchini, and mushrooms.
4;This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back
1;"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.  My first visit resulted in about a 1.5 hour wait and the order was incorrect, so the final wait time was close to 2 hours.  My second visit on 08/19/12 was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.\n\nThis is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \""who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\"".\n\nI'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review."
0;"I had a pretty good time at this place soon after it opened.  The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas.  We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!  I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend.  Do you think I will suggest Tryst?"
3;I don't got to school at UNCC but discovered the gardens because I was looking for something outdoorsy, safe, and active to do while I was visiting the area for work and looking for some true beauty in the middle of stripmall-landia.  What a find and worth the effort to find and take the time to relax and enjoy the beauty of a simple walk on a hidden path in a busy campus!\n\nAlthough many plants are not in season (I visited in January, many plants were in hibernation), the botanical gardens, per my interpretation, are designed as series of walking paths that capture natures essence from various perspectives.  The effect is calming, relaxing, and purifying, regardless if you're a traveler searching out something different, or a student seeking solace, refuge, or even just a moment of calm in the midst of a hectic class schedule.
3;"Everything you need is here.\n\nWe stayed here on a stagette because the bride has seen \""The Hangover\"" way too many times. Actually, I never asked her why this hotel... but she insisted that we stay here. I am glad she did because it seriously has everything you want... It's smoking hot in August (duh) so being somewhere with a decent nightclub, a bunch of restaurants, shopping, a beautiful pool, a convenience store... seriously, if need be, I wouldn't have had to venture outside.\n\nWe had booked a room in the Forum Tower. When we arrived, they upgraded us to the Palace Tower. Woot woot. Much bigger room with two washrooms. Perfect for three girls. If we were on a higher floor, we would have had a view of the pool. I think I saw the top of Snackus Maximus. I wish we had a fridge for our use since ours was filled to the brim with mini-bar regulars. But we had ice... after getting vodka and mixers from the store in the lobby, we were able to imbibe in the room. \n\nWe spent a lot of time in the room since we spent a lot of time in the hotel. It was just so easy to pop upstairs to grab something or to drop off our shopping before coming back down to play the Big Buck Hunter slots. We wandered to Spago's in the Forum Shops before dancing the night away at Pure. \n\nUtter convenience."
4;Perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos.  No need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater.
1;"Sleep Poet Antique Mall is big, and they have a lot of different kind of things.  However, the great items and great bargains appear to be few and far between, which is a huge turn-off for me.  Overall, I give it about a 2.5.\n\nYou could spend probably hours here looking at all their wares.  They offer a wide selection of items, from jewelry, furniture, clothes, decorations, records, books, dishes, and other random kitchen items (and much, much more).  The place is filled with little \""booths,\"" which I am assuming is either an attempt to group types of items together or are all owned by one person/business.  It's fairly easy to navigate your way around the store from booth to booth.\n\nOn the weekends, this place is crazy.  People are packed in here, and parking becomes quite difficult.  It is also difficult to find reasonably-priced, good items here.  Because the store is so large, it's quite time-consuming to take the time to find a good bargain.  Most of the wares they offer seem overpriced, with many of them in serious disrepair.  Just because it's \""old\"" does not always mean it's an antique.  \n\nI would probably go check it out again, but definitely not on a weekend.  I am not a fan of large crowds, and this place can definitely get very crowded.  That being said, this a great place for people who long for a good bargain hunt.  If you don't mind a bit of a crowd, and you are the sort of person who loves to wade through things for an awesome bargain, this is probably the place for you.  I'm definitely sad that I am far too impatient for this type of place, because I've seen people walk away with some nice stuff."
2;This place is all about convenience.\n\nIt is convenient to grab a drink while friends are waiting in line.\nIt is convenient to get a refill as you walk from hotel to hotel.\nTherefore (no suprise) it is conveniently over priced.\n\nI appreciate the craft beers - some of my favs on tap, Fat Tire, Mirror Pond, Moose Drool. And I do appreciate that you can people watch like CRAZY at this spot, but I wouldn't stay and hang out. I will however be grabbing a drink ever so often as I stroll by.
1;To your left you'll see a rock that looks like a dinosaur and to your right you'll see a rock that looks like a person.  Sometimes you'll see some real animals, but not today...  \n\nReally? Is that all you've got.  Maybe we just didn't luck out, but our tour guide was horrible.  Not witty, not funny, not even that interesting.  He was clearly reading from a script because at one point he lost his place or got confused or something and ended up re-reciting the entire opening three minutes, word for word.  Most of the time he just but on a soundtrack, which clearly was way too short for the entire 90 minute tour since we listened to the Titanic song 4 times.  As a side note, you may not want to remind people of a huge boat accident when we're doing a boat tour... but that's just me.  \n\nDefinitely something for the older crowd, but even they seemed restless after about 45 minutes.
0;Came in and asked for a table and of the 15 tables, 2 were occupied and maybe 7 had dirty dishes on them. I was told I'd have to wait or go to the bar.  Retarded right? Fine.  I go to the bar and wait 5 minutes to get attention.  Meanwhile i witnessed about 5 dishes getting cold in the window waiting to get picked up.  I looked around and there were more than enough employees but they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. \n\nI order beef red curry with no basil or mint leaf. 15 min later I get beef red curry with basil all over the sumbitch.  I returned it with no apology...not even a smile.  In fact, I didn't catch a smile since I had walked in.  Service with a smile?  Nuh uh. Shitty service, no smile.\n\nNow for the food...eh.  Yeah.  Whatevs.  \n\nSo...my first time here:\nShitty service\nMessy dining room\nNo smiles (like they didn't want customers)\nAnd the food was just ok\n\nBad day at the office?  Naw man...they broke too many industry rules.  I'm out!  And i definitely ain't coming back.
4;What can I say. I loved this store.  It was a little pricey but it's really a MUST to visit.   You can personalize a bag of M & M's for anything you want them to say.  Also, you have to see the 3D movie which is free on the top level.   It's only 10 to 15 min long but sooo worth it  whether you're a kid or an adult.
4;Just go walk down it. You'll see.
4;Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\n\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!
2;"Yes, I'm a foodie. Yes, I was reared in the pastoral Driftless Zone, home to some of the best dairy in Dairyland. Yes, I am quite fond of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream (which, in Madison, is carried here and only here).  However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude. \n\nI stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it's not as extensive as I'd expect--despite Fromagination's artful arranging I'd venture a guess that Whole Foods' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can't handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn't quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \""Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\"" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \""Ma'am, I'm having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.  But I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.\"" Clearly embarrassed, he turned and walked out.  \n\nThat's the most extreme example I've witnessed (though on separate occasions I've heard people say \""I have money to spend here...\"" as they stood, stymied by the lack of attention) but it exemplifies the general vibe pretty well.  With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I'm there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I'm merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they'll steer me away from it! \""This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that's what you want?\"" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.  Thanks!  \n\nI will keep going to Fromagination, especially because the shop takes great pains to promote local/regional cheese makers, but I hope they consider the constructive criticism and perhaps start having fun with the idea of selling cheese."
3;the food has great presentation but the decor is drabby and needs to be more lively with more style. the tuna poke was excellent as well as the cookie with ice cream. i would go back for more food to enjoy.
3;Absolutely love this place!! We have been going here for about 4 years (since we moved to this side of town). The staff had always been very friendly and helpful. The owner in particular is very nice and remembers us every time we come in and actually tries to get to know us. The food is delicious, especially for the price. We bring all our friends and family who come to visit here. Only downside is that the location is a bit small and gets quite busy on the weekends but thankfully pick up orders are never a problem! Totally recommend this place!!
1;Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  \n\nShort order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!
4;"This food was seriously delicious. I hate to say it but i am seriously \""craving\"" one of their bowls right now. The flavors are well done and their products are fresh. If you want a healthy and delicious meal, you need to here. They have tons of gluten free options, vegetarian and vegan dishes for all of your dietary needs. Head on over!"
0;"I've had a variety of experiences with Green Cab, ranging from average to terrible. \n\nTonight, a Friday night, I called a cab at 9:50pm to take me from one end of downtown to the other. Yes, a decently busy time to call, but nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm willing to wait 15-25 minutes on a Friday night, I'm not willing to wait 50 minutes. By that point, your energy is exhausted from the frustration of waiting. \n\nIn general, Green Cab kind of blows. Yes, they have eco-friendly cars and sweet ipads, but that's really not what I want in a cab service. I'd rather have a short wait time or a reliable estimate if it's a busy period. With Green Cab, there's really no telling when they'll arrive. \n\nI've also had trouble paying on several occasions. Some of the drivers enjoying pulling the old \""my machine is broken\"" when you try to pay with credit cards, while others claim not to have any change for your $20. You're a cab driver. Your only responsibility is to drive, accept credit cards, and be able to make change. If you're missing 2 of those 3, you're doin' it wrong. \n\nAlso, if you're waiting for Green Cab and want to see where your cab is, forget it. Rather than placing your call on a hold line, Green Cab routes calls to a busy signal, so you're SOL in terms of following up when it's busy. \n\nOther than that, Green Cab is awesome. \n\nAll in all, I'd stick with Union Cab. You *might* pay more, but it's worth it. Plus, the drivers are way cooler. One even had Cash Cab-style questions ready to ask me at 3am. But maybe you're not into Cash Cab. So then there's always Green Cab."
4;Love, love, love this spot!  One of my favorite things about staying at Planet Hollywood is being so close to Earls.  This delicious sandwich spot is open 24 hours... How convenient!\n\nSanwiches- I've tried most sandwiches on the menu and they've all been amazing.  They're always hot, fresh, and delish.  My personal favorites are the chipotle chicken and veggie sandwich. \n\nWraps- They're fresh but nothing as tasty as the sandwiches.\n\nSalads- Small in size, but tasty. Try the Cobb.\n\nBaked Goods- ahhhh.... The cookies are moist and rich.  Although I'm usually a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, the sugar cookie was my favorite in this case.  \n\nDon't let the long line discourage you!  They move pretty quickly, especially during the day.
2;"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. \n\nThe food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).\n\nFor my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. \n\nAnother suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \""I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\""\n\nI'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed."
3;I SO want to give this place 5 stars.  Friendly, delicious and great prices.  \n\nBut...I just can't do 5 stars for a vegan restaurant where the employees hang out outside smoking.  Because now when I order buffalo hummus or yummy grape leave dolmas, I can't help but wonder if the employee just lit up on her break, and grabbed my tahini with nicotine-stained-smokey fingers.  Yuk.  Smoking + cooking?  It's a deal-breaker. Smoking + cooking at a vegan restaurant? Seems like an SNL skit.
0;"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!\n\nHygiene,  hygiene,  hygiene! \n\nI'm writing about the horrific hygiene at this place.   One of the servers was putting on her lipstick and lip liner at the hostess/check in station,  handles plates and silverware.  \n\nI'm walking to our table I see another lady sneeze into her hands with both hands cupped.  Didnt wash her hands, just started fixing her her eyeliner with her finger tips.   I told my wife, \""oh my gosh  hope this person isn't serving peple\"", and then she walks up to our table and introduces herself stating that she will be our waitress.   I was literally sick to my stomach. \n\nI asked to see the manager, and about 10 minutes of waiting told him the deplorable practices I observed, and left. I wish good old Gordon was there to throw a fit!!!\n\nStay away if you value your health!"
0;Ok, I'm the kind of girl who grew up staying in motels, so I'm ok with your average Travelodge. This place is your BELOW average Travelodge... Reasons:\n\n1. Didn't ask if we were ok with a smoking room (yuck...hotels still allow this?)\n\n2. One bath towel, two guests... twice in the same week, with no apology\n\n3. Air conditioning sounds louder than a Harley Davidson\n\n4. Got back after a full day out (8+ hours) and the room wasn't cleaned\n\n5. Front desk didn't seem phased by this when I called to complain \n\nI will NOT be staying in a Travelodge again anytime soon. I highly recommend any other hotel than this one if you're planning on staying in Scottsdale.
0;This place gets crazy packed and the lines are ridiculous! its out the door and when you finally get inside the door there is another line waiting! I had to wait almost 1- 1 1/2 hours just to eat here and it WAS ALL HYPE! because this is the first Golden Corral to open up down here so of course those enticing commercials we see time to time on TV makes people super excited for this one! But from my experience here this is what i have to say about this place.\n\n- Long line & ridiculous wait\n- Overhyped\n- Drinks ARE NOT included with your meal\n- Understaffed and they couldn't handle all the customers pouring in\n- Area was not clean & dirty tables were left around\n- Waited 30 minutes one time to just get to the grilled steaks\n- People would be eating in the lines BARBARICALLY or kids will be running around with food in their hands\n- People are RUDE, but hey when you're hungry you tend to get grumpy\n- Food is WAYYYYY too salty!!!\n- Desserts were tasteless and stale \n\nThe only good thing was their steaks, the chef cooked it to a perfect medium rare, but  after everything i had to go through to get the steaks. NO THANKS!
3;Free Wi-Fi, Unlimited Coffee Refills of surprisingly decent quality, a handful of individually bagged hot teas, and now with 3-4 varieties of iced tea plus iced coffee - sure I'm not going to pay what they charge for a sandwich I could make for 1/3 the price using better ingredients at home, but for beverages and simply killing time or getting some work done there aren't too many places I prefer.
4;I went to Toyama with a few friends on Saturday night and had a great experience. The owner and his wife were very nice and she greeted us when we arrived at Toyama. \n\nThe sushi was great, very fresh and plenty of different choices to choose from. We were all very happy with our food and service. \n\nThey also had Toro available ... which has been hard to find.  My fiance is always asking for it when we go to sushi places and it's been rare that anyone has had it. \n\nToyama is great  for a smaller place to have dinner with friends.
0;Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8am\nWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone \nVery disappointing
0;"Verizon stores and their system of herding their customers must have been designed by some Machiavellian-type person who watches from afar, with hidden cameras placed in all locations, and watches what transpires inside the stores like some sort of \""Big Brother\"" experiment in human behavior.\n\nWhen I walk into a Verizon Wireless store because my unfortunately-named Verizon Glyde (all I can think of is a personal lubricant, how about you? maybe I have a dirty mind...) with a touch screen no longer wants to be touched... the \""greeter\"" scowls at me, tells me it's gonna be at least an hour and a half, and then adds my name to the bottom of the queue.  \n\nI instantly notice that it smells of excrement... and that, quite literally, the store is crawling with humans.  It's like a bus station.  There are sad-looking people on benches, huddled together for moral support, crying in the corner, and laying in a puddle on the floor.  I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.\n\nI have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.  I bore witness to two different women using Verizon phones, calling customer service in tears, bawling about how the reps at the store refused to help them. I should have taken this as a sign. I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue. I mean, there was almost a brawl. I saw three crickets, a spider and a roach... and this was all before my name was called.\n\nThe service rep could not, no, WOULD not, fix my phone.  He took one look at the Glyde and started to laugh. \""THIS is the worst phone Verizon ever produced.  I can't fix this thing.  I won't even be trying.  Sorry, girl.  You need to get yourself another phone.\""  Rep then proceeded to detail my options. A. Buy brand-new expensive phone. B. Buy pre-owned expensive phone. C. Be phoneless.  \""Surely you must have a clunky Zack Morris-style phone to donate to a damsel in distress!\"" I protested.  No dice.  \""Not even a loaner until my next paycheck?\"" Not a snowball's chance in hell.  \n\nIt's ever so obvious that I was never going to get my phone fixed, and no matter what was wrong with it, I was going to be told that I had no choice but to purchase an entire new phone.  I think it's more than a little messed-up to not offer your customers solutions and options instead of backing them into corners. I'm between paychecks, and couldn't justify paying the evil overlords of Verizon hundreds of dollars for another POS, so I am now incommunicado, and am totally bummed."
1;I had the pork sliders.\nBased on that i cant recommend the place.\nIf you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, try one of the other restaurants.\nThe service was good however.
4;Dr. Harter is an absolutely amazing and caring doctor.  He has been my OB since my daughter was born in 2009. I had an emergency c-section due to severe preeclampsia, after planning a VBAC. I was devastated by the turn of events, but Dr. Harter held my hand and told me he was very sorry but I was too sick to wait any longer, but I could definitely have a VBAC someday. Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have asked for a better or more supportive OB. *Note*Due to his popularity, it can be hard to get in to see him, and wait times can be long because he's delivering babies...a lot! Those are small inconveniences to me, to get a good doctor!  :)
4;Had a great dinner at Elephant Bar last night! \n\nGot a coupon in the mail for 2 meals and an appetizer for $20! While they did limit the  selections you could get with the coupon, we were happy with the choices so it worked out fine.\n\nFood was delicious and the service was fantastic! Waitress was very attentive and polite.\n\nLocation was a plus too! Had a lovely walk around The District shops afterward. \n\nAll and all, a hands down 5 stars!
0;If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction
0;Horrible.  Went in looking for a gift salesgirl said buy anything pink and you get free socks.   Picked out a gift waited in a line that there was no organization to with people cutting in.  Got to the counter and the girl rings me up and I ask where are my socks and she shrugs and says oh we ran out awhile ago.  Got to love the communication or lack there of with this organization.  I won't be back.  Hello Lucy and Athleta can't wait to become a regular with you guys!!
1;Food was average, waitress was the worst.\n\nWe had 4 people in our party. 3 of us had failrly good meals my son however ordered the Philly ckeese steak which was a soggy mess. We thought about sending it back but the waitress never came back to ask how everthing came out. When the waitress did come back she just went through the motions of being a server she truly didnt care and should find a new line of work. My son ordered water, she forgot.. \n\nI will not be back on our next visit to Vegas...
1;I dunno, I was drunk when I got there.  It's amateur night there every night! They have a mechanical bull.  You might find yourself looking up at the sky wondering if it was 8 seconds.  Trust me it wasnt.
0;Used to love this place.  The summer drink menu is disappointing and the service last time was lacking.  We went there for happy hour, and found out that we could only use our chip (Buy 1, Get 1 tap beers/wine) before 6 p.m.   It would have been nice if someone would have told us that, esp. since we went there only for happy hour.  This used to be the place to go for us (as a young mod place) with drinks that were $8-12 and well worth it.  After our last trip there, I am not sure we will be back.  Two drinks and an appetizer and our bill was nearly $40.  We are happy to pay that if the service is good and the menu has good selections.  This place is going to go under if they don't fix something.
4;Delhi Palace has won my heart for Indian food.  There is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time.  I'm not sure if this location is associated with the Delhi Palace on University, but I have been to both and liked both.  Sometimes Indian food buffets can feel not so fresh, but both of these restaurants keep things fresh and heated.  \n\nThis restaurant has my stamp of approval as my favorite Indian food in the Phoenix area.
2;The feeling of being inside a gigantic chandelier was truly a novel experience, however it wasn't worth the pretentiously pricey drinks. Weak drinks, average service. Boring
2;I'm mixed on this one.  We had a disaster for Brunch so we wanted to make up for it for dinner.  I was totally craving sushi and I did indeed get great sushi here.  It was enough to make this sushi snob want to come back for more...as take-out.\n\nThe ambiance leaves much to be desired for such a high priced place.  If I am paying $14 for a sushi roll and $25 for  a dinner plate I want date night worthy.  What I got was Denny's worthy.  It's cheap, it's boring, and there were kids crying at the table next to us the entire time.  I asked about switching up a roll and was told changing spicy salmon into spicy crab in a sushi roll would incur a $2 charge.  I said nevermind and went with the roll as is.  The waiter was attentive and just the right amount of presence, always a plus, and other than the decor and the weird upcharge I LOVED my food.  Edamame was perfectly steamed, the sushi was ohsogood.  My husband ordered the hibachi which was sooooo bland.  I don't think they used any salt or pepper in the cooking process.  There were three small pieces of shrimp, a tiny handful of veggies, loads of noodles and rice, and a good portion of steak(which was very tender, but unflavored) and chicken which was overcooked.\n\nAll in all the sushi is worth going back for, but I won't be trying their Hibachi nor will I be staying around.  Take-out is where it's at.
1;I expected to love this place. We loved  Burger across the street and Steak at Paris, Very disappointing had lunch with my husband at the bar. New waiter on his first day probably would have been better on his own. The guy training him was offensive.  When I said I did not like their take on the corned beef sandwich in a bowl he said I shouldn't worry about looking pretty while I eat it just dig in there.  high priced as it is and after presenting our Harrahs card still did not get the $4 off a $20 so called corned beef sandwich. Why bother putting the two prices on the menu if they don't understand what it means.  Will not be going back.
1;I tried this place because of the high reviews. It's a shame when you go somewhere with high expectations and you're let down. \n\nWe tried their one item carryout pizza special for $5.45, let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The pepperoni and cheese were so skimpy and non-existant. I ended up scraping the toppings onto TWO slices, the rest of the pizza/ scraped off dough were thrown out.\n\nFortunately, or so I thought I still had a BLT, the bacon consisted of little bits here and there. What happened to the fresh bacon? The long slices of bacon? Or plenty of bacon? They weren't in my sandwich, that's for sure.\n\nChecho fries, yeah we got an order. $2.99 for a little to go box doesn't seem worth it. When I was there I saw a basket being delivered to the table next to me, I thought that was more like it, so unless you're eating at the restaurant pass on the Checho fries.\n\nI probably won't go back.
4;It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.
0;Never rent from this Avis. The Operations Manager is a sloppy blonde, with a really bad attitude. Absolutely appalling customer service. I'm not sure who decided she was a good fit for being in charge, but they should strongly consider a more personable candidate for this position. She obviously didn't want to be there, and had no interest in servicing customers. Go down the way to Enterprise. Don't waste your money at this Avis. If you must rent with Avis, cab to the one on Las Vegas Blvd, cause the lady who runs this one is seriously past her expiration date...
4;My hubby n I dined in tonight. Got a pizza. It was delicious! The prices are good & the staff is friendly. Extra points for this location being so convenient to where live!
0;"I shop 100% organic for myself and about 70% for my household. Coming to this store was a MAJOR disappointment. I feel like the people who work/shop here are generally uneducated about clean eating. The one thing I found that I needed was a small bag of organic grapes to appease my 5 year old sister. When I went to check out (that was my only item) and they said $10 my jaw dropped. Then the cashier exclaimed, \""Well their organic what do you expect!\"" You mean to tell me that if I want fruits free of GMOs and chemicals, I should pay 4 times the general asking price? Mid summer? No thanks. Right before that, the (maybe 20 year old) uneducated butcher told me that their free range meat, the one option they had, was \""basically organic\"" because the cow are grass and grass \""probably\"" doesn't have any chemicals. Are you kidding me!? I wouldn't go here if I were a millionaire! Terrible service! Terrible selection. The 2 most important things to my family and I!"
3;The bruschetta is tasty and a great starter.\n\nThe Oregano's Salad (hold the olives) is just bomb. Order the small and it's enough for 3 adults.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (added pineapple) and it was tasty. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh, and it's not greasy.\n\nThe servers are upbeat, fast, and knowledgeable.\n\nThe menu is kind of huge and you can skip over things easily, but do NOT miss the warm cookie pie for dessert.\n\nPS - if you are cold and sitting outside, ask for a blanket...they've got them!
2;Typically buffet. Dried out food and over priced. Don't go without a discount of some kind. Go the Denny's for breakfast instead.
0;The vibe of this place seems very sketchy, and the fact at all of the work on the walls has prices seems a bit off. The staff are unfriendly and rude and do not greet you after you walk in for a good ten minutes or so. That being said, I do not know about tattoo work here. Piercings, however, are a different story.\nDon't do it.\nThe woman who did them did not seem to know what she was doing, and did not even clamp the area before piercing, causing bleeding. And then she went on to make fun of my friend for this, for a good long time. Talk about unprofessional! She also refused to put in the type of jewelry requested, and only put in the type she first grabbed, even with an explanation about why this type of jewelry would be the worst for the piercing. \nI had heard good things about this place, but I see know that everyone was very mistaken. In the future, if I ever need another piercing or tattoo, be assured that I will not be going here. Or trusting the judgement of said friends.
4;Hey, this place is really good. And they have sweet music. And it's cheap. And there might be some alcohol there. Go.
4;Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!
4;I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!
2;With such great reviews I have been trying! I have been there tree times now and I am not surprised! The prices are reasonable and you get decent food. But thats not what I expected. The chocolate and caramel trotewas bad! The cupcakes were ok but for 1usd you can't expect much. The buttercream wasnt impressive... But the filled croissants with blueberry or the one with cheese were not bad at all. It was not a real croissant but satisfying. Since it is in a really convenient location I will probably go back but without the expectations that I had before.
0;Went with a family group of 12 and no one had anything good to say about their meal.
0;Very poor service.  I ordered several books online and requested all new.  They shipped me two of them used.  When I contacted them, they said they do that if no new ones are available - without even confirming with the customer.  When I said that I wanted new, as I requested, they said I would have to bring the book in and order it again.  I reminded them that I paid for shipping so I wouldn't have to go down to pick them up.  They did not care.  They pretty much said that I would have to do the leg work to correct THEIR mistake.  No concept at all of what good customer service is.
0;"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! If I could give zero stars, I would. The people (who I won't even refer to as nail technicians), were performing a pedicure on my feet when they CUT the bottom of my foot and then called me a LIAR and yelled at me and told me that the cut had already been there, which it obviously hadn't (the cut which they did was bleeding and had erythema around the edges because it had just happened). If the cut would have already been present, I wouldn't have gone in for a pedicure in the first place and they would have noticed a cut during the first five minutes before they cut me. While the cut upset me, the accusatory demeanor of the staff was rude and totally uncalled for. I got up and left after being treated so horribly. With all of the nail salons in the Valley, go somewhere else. Such a horrible \""nail spa\"" with rude, condescending, accusatory staff."
1;I've had it with this place. I've never used the car wash, I don't buy the overpriced junk food and useless trinkets they sell there, I only go there for gas....and only because it's located on the way home from work. \n\nOkay, the last three times I've been there, the pumps failed to give out a receipt. It may seem trivial to you....but it really bothers me when the machine specifically asks if you want a receipt, then fails to deliver one.\n\nBefore you can even get gas here, the pump makes you complete a questionnaire. Question 1: Are you a Vons something something member? No! Question 2: Would you like a car wash? No! Question 3: Would you like a receipt? Yes!!!!! Then after all that, you can finally pump your gas.\n\nI'm really tired of paying for gas outside, pumping gas outside, then going inside to wait in line behind a group of confused stoners counting out pennies and nickels to pay for their crumpled bags of Funyuns and 94oz Mountain Dews.\n\nI'm going someplace else from now on.
3;This place is absolutely a treat.... Great dessert section portions are perfect bite. I had wine paring with mine
0;Back to poor service.  The food was ok, not worse than before but the experience was dreadful. A coupe seated after us got their good, bill, paid, and left before we were midway through our meal. Waiter was barely around.  Yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff.\n\nService was so bad the waiter got $0 tip.  We will not be going back here for quite some time, once again.  Shame too because they are the only place I know of that has banoffie pie.
2;"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place back when it was Dodge Theater but I don't see it here so oh well. My husband and I went to see a Christmas concert here of The Piano Guys recently and that was the first time I've been here in a couple years. First off, I was shocked to see a line of people that extended down a full city block and then wrapped around and doubled back almost the whole way down the street. There were no dividers or ropes or any staff providing direction so everyone was confused as to where the line started and ended and I saw a ton of people \""taking cuts\"". It seems like they could come up with a better system for getting people in the door. Fortunately it moved pretty quickly so we still made it to our seats before the show started.\n\nMy biggest complaints about this place are that there are not enough restroom facilities and also that the drink prices are outrageous. I know, I know, you could say the same about almost any other concert venue in the valley but that is no excuse. As others have mentioned the seats are a little on the small side but not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was more leg room, mainly because once people are seated there is absolutely no room left for walking if you have a seat near the middle of a row. I will say that the acoustics are great and the lighting and effects at the shows I have seen were wonderful. I also like that it is small enough that even the seats in the back can still see but I do wish that they had not put seats on the bottom sides where the edges of the stage block your view. They do warn you when you buy the tickets that it is an obstructed view but really you can not see hardly anything. They should have just used that space for more bathrooms instead of seats that are basically worthless."
0;I will always give any Albertson's one or two stars simply due to the fact that they refuse to put in self check-out lanes. One time the manager told me that his customers requested they get removed...really? The three's a crowd rule is dumb especially when you only have one lane open or maybe two and even then one of the lanes is 15 items or less. This is a backwoods store who is not willing to advance to the future and give customers a guaranteed fast way to buy their groceries. Nothing else here really stands out and they don't really make their own bakery items. The best thing I have found is the Instant Rice, for some reason this rice kicks butt over the big names of rice. I also get annoyed when the checkers leave their area and come outside the checker zone (standing in front of lane) while I'm pulling in with my cart. This just wastes time overall, it is like a toll collector leaving the booth when I want to pay my toll.\nAlso, I don't like Halloween stuff appearing in August.
3;"I gave them 4 stars only because they are so new. Probably would be 3 stars but the staff was trying very hard. I think they should STOP, review talk about the pros and cons and have a good training day. Staff were confused on where food went and what table numbers were. You can't have staff walking around looking for who ordered what.\nPOS the staff was using was phone size and they seemed to struggle with inputting the orders.\nNow the food, we had a table of 4 and all had something different. Cod bites were good, as were the chicken skewers. I had the Meatloaf which I would give an A, very tasty and the mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned for my taste.\nAnother dish was the Chicken Noodles, not-so-good, had a very odd taste spices didn't seem to work.\n3rd dish was the Salmon surf. Pretty hard to screw up Salmon but it was over salted, sorry.\nLast dish was Fish Tacos. She had Cod tacos instead of Salmon and said she enjoyed it. She wished they offered Black beans with the tacos to make it more authentic, but enjoyed it.\nDesert we had the Bread pudding. It was very good, not the best in town, but very good.\n\nLocation, Location, Location is one of the best in the Valley. I'm not sure why other restaurants have not made it there as it's a wonderful, beautiful location on the Lake in \""The Lakes\"" community. Tons of space inside and on the outside patio, there's even a boat dock for the locals.\nEntertainment.\nThey had Live music on the Friday night we were there and they were good. They also have separate areas where you and your friends can play pool, throw darts, or play a little corn hole. Huge bar fully loaded makes it a place you could spend the evening.\nWho was there?\nSeemed like a nice mix of people young and old. Decor was very open, maybe even too much but I still liked it. View was amazing.\n\nI hope they take the suggestions of their critics good and bad as we'd really love to see this place succeed. With a little tweaking, this could be a place I visit often. We wish them the best of luck, we'll try again in a couple months to see how things progress."
2;I always come here during lunch because they have good specials on the tofu soup! It's cheap, delicious & comes with a lot of food! And usually the service is quick- not too long of a wait.\n\nHowever, I ate here for dinner the other night and the wait was ridiculously long! It was just a party of 2 but we waited over an hour. What made me angry was the fact that there were seats open!! There were at least 4 tables open but they didn't fill those up. They made us wait an hour and they finally sat us- at the table that was open this entire time!!! \nWe did the all you can eat and it was only $16.99. Lots of food & it was good~ love their short ribs!!\nIt's good, cheap food but you just have to wait a looooong time!
2;For french food, it was a regular food.. not bad and nothing out of the ordinary.
2;Always wanted to stay at the Palms and finally did for New Years. Was intrigued by the clubs and restaurants inside and figured, even though it was off the strip, it wouldn't be too hard to get around with cabs. \n\nHotel itself was fine. Room was nice. But I wasn't impressed with the clubs, and it wasn't worth staying there just for them. My group ended up going out to the Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, The Venetian and Aria for our nights out anyway. \n\nWouldn't stay here again. On strip is much better if you're planning to bounce around various nightlife spots.
0;The food here was TERRIBLE. Really, Really bad. We had ceviche. It tasted like ketchup with chunks. I had shrimp, which was very over cooked. My husband had a hamburger which he ordered medium, but was very well done. My friend had chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The place was empty. I can see how the patio would be nice on a pretty night, but it was too hot to sit outside so we were stuck inside, which is like any other chain restaurant in America. The beer was fine. The service was good. Would NEVER GO BACK.
3;I really enjoy the decor and atmosphere here. Comfy couches, great coffee, lots of outlets for us computer-dwellers. I had the tomato basil quiche...it was good, but it was around 2 pm so it probably would have been really good this morning. \nI have never been here in the morning hours, so I don't know how hectic it gets or what the service is like when it's busy, but it's great for a midafternoon study spot.
4;I can't wait to get back to the Wynn.  The Wynn is truly one of the top hotels on the strip.  They employees do the little extra things that make you feel like you are the most important guest in the building.  Check-in was fast and easy.\n\nThe room was the best that I have had in Vegas!!  The decor was modern and the room was very clean.\n\nWe ate at the buffet for dinner and the food was the best we had on the trip - recommend that you eat there at least once on your stay.\n\nThe casino has something for everyone.  The minimum bets on the tables are reasonable to extravagant depending on your style of play.  The dealers make you feel comfortable regardless of your expertise.\n\nRelax and have fun at the Wynn!!
3;I signed up on Yelp just to post about Lunchbreak. Even though their coffee and breakfast burrito are my favorite, I have never had an un-tasty meal from these guys. Definitely can't go wrong with the buffalo chicken wrap, italian meatball sub or chef salad. Very prompt deliveries!
0;Working at a fast food place is not a dream job, but it's not that complicated either. You are there to do your job correctly and get paid, the end. This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.\n\nMy meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location.
1;Was craving a frozen hot chocolate all week long prior to going to Vegas, so I walked down here after doing a bit of shopping at the Forum shops. Seeing as how I was ONLY gonna get a frozen hot chocolate, I went to the line outside and thought, oh, this is going to move fast cuz there's only 4 people in front of me. \n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\n20 min later, I finally get to the front of the line. SLOWEST MOVING LINE EVER! Why do they not have more people working here when the line moves at the speed of molasses. My grandma can do cartwheels faster. \n\nAnywhoo, after paying a ridiculous $10 and waiting over 20 min, i finally had my meh frozen hot chocolate. Wasn't as good as the first time I had it. I feel sorry for the people who were waiting behind me in the growing line.
0;It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
1;We just moved to MTL and he had never had a smoked meat! We were a bit lost and hungry and stumbled upon this Dunns location. The roomies had just has a great Dunns experience back home. So I decided this would be a great place to intro TJ to the smoked meat sandwich. I was wrong. We split the traditional medium smoked meat platter (sandwich, fries, coleslaw, and a pickle). Positives - enough food for two, the fries were good and plentiful, pickle was tasty. Negatives - a bit on the pricey side (~$15 for what is supposed to feed one person),  smoked meat was meh (dry, salty, overly processed). Overall it was ok but I'll have a hard time convince him to try smoked meat again.
0;I have to agree with all the other bad reviews. \n\n1.)Rooms are super old, but maybe you need to request certain towers. Did check for bed bugs because me and my daughter were itchy. But didn't see any.\n2.)They double charged and now is taking me 3 calls to get refund so I think I'll have to dispute with my bank.\n3.)Check in needs serious help in what's called customer service :/ they told me to come back to check in when as soon as I left they were checking in other guest. So I stood and watched for 10min and every single person was being checked in so I sent my husband and bingo we were in. \n4.) Empty pool was a bit weird to me.\nRegardless of it being winter you do have resort fees!\n5.)all I can say is you get what you pay for.\nIn my case I'm paying double so I end up paying what would of been a decent place.
0;"Terrible customer service. I called Walgreen's customer service 4 times, and never received a call from management as promised. Here is the email I sent them, which I have not received a reply to either!\n\nThis is the Walgreen's located at 2000 S Mill Ave  Tempe, AZ\n\n\""I have called, and spoke with your customer service several times, but have never received a call back as I was promised. The phone number associated with these calls is 480.967.XXXX. The exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls. I am xxxx xxxx, a 59 year old Walgreen's customer of 30 years. I ride a small two wheel electric scooter. It is smaller than a shopping cart. It is not practical to lock this scooter, and the expensive batteries cannot be secured. This scooter is like a two wheeled skateboard with handle bars. I have ridden it to Walgreen's, and brought it in the store with me to pick up prescriptions on many occasions. The last time I picked up a prescription I was told by a man, I assume is a manager, that I can't bring my scooter in the store anymore. This is ridiculous as it is small, makes no noise, makes no mess, takes up very little room, and is my only means of transportation right now. No one has ever complained about it, and when I mentioned not being allowed to bring it in to the pharmacist, he could not understand why, and commented that people bring bikes in the store. I bring this scooter into the grocery, hardware store, fast food stores, and everywhere I go with no problems. I explained this on the phone to your representative, and was told I would be contacted. I was never contacted even after calling back several times, and was told the complaint was being escalated. . This is terrible customer service! I regret that I am contacting my Dr., and having my prescriptions transferred to CVS. CVS has no problem with me bringing my scooter in the store, and  also allow my dog in the store, if I walk there with my dog. I am very disappointed with Walgreen's apparent lack of concern. I will also leave reviews on line wherever possible to let other people know of this incident. \"""
4;"I don't really do the lounge scene back home due to one really bad experience a few years ago at Enclave. I wouldn't go as far as to call Enclave much of a lounge, but they all kind of seem the same to me. Until I met Bond. It was a \""one-thing-led to-another\"" relationship with Bond. *Blush!*\n\nI visited Bond about 3 times over the course of one week and even decided to stay at his place on my last night! Well, by his place, I really mean the Cosmopolitan. And it was with my husband for our final night in Vegas, so I guess it was kind of a threesome. Yeeah... about Bond.\n\nThe music is pumping, but not obnoxious. The DJ was great. The decor is excellent. The seats are comfy. The scene is full of variety, but not like a douche circus. I drinks? Don Johnson joined me a few times. The staff? Friendly and fabulous. I donned my glitzy best and can't wait to visit again on my next trip through town."
3;"I love H&M, they are affordable and have some unique styles. I am the type that loves embellishments; give me zippers, buttons, clasps, pins, and patches on my clothes. The fact that they are using organic cotton and recycled fibers intrigue me. Their dress clothes are stiff and abrasive against the skin, at first, but after a few washes they won't irritate. They are good for work. Especially if you are looking for cheap, stylish, and you won't be heartbroken if they get messed up. \n\nH&M's casual wear is more my style. Their t-shirts and jackets appeal to my excessive need for bedazzlement.\n\nTry everything on, because they don't seem to have any standard size. I was swimming in a medium button up, but tried another style only to have it fit perfectly. This happened with jackets, under shirts, and pants. It cannot be a fluke."
3;Prior to NYC having any Whole Foods location I was OBSESSED with any location I happened upon. We have had WF for over a decade now in NYC but I still visit other locations with interest. This is one of the nicest I have been to probably in part because it is quite new. (having opened last September one of the employees told me) The outdoor seating area on the 2nd floor is nice. \n\nClearly we are not in NYC as one of the deals in the prepared foods area was 4 for $4 where you could get 4 of the salads (healthy selections designations) for $4. The soup selection was pretty good the only thing I would say is the hot/cold prepared foods on the buffet were kind of so so.\n\nLots of available parking downstairs.
1;I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer.\n\nWe didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here
3;fun little course. great practice spot. cheap too. if you dont mind the noise from the planes, you will enjoy it here
0;Oh Avoid this place @ ALL Costs. They will double bill your insurance, run tests that they do not bother to #1 inform you they're running & #2 you cannot get test results even on tests they run. They are very unprofessional & treat you as if you are a hassle to them. You will get billed for $53.00 for going in on Sunday which they consider to be a weekend visit. My son wound up going to Southern Hills Hospital & what a blessing it was to meet Dr. Sondrup & his staff. Dr. Hayes & Dr. Daulat have no business in the medical field. They spent all of 7 minutes with my son on 4 different visits {not the 5 they are billing for}. Honestly, they should be ashamed of themselves & may God have mercy on their souls.
3;Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet.
4;I love this place. When my family first moved to Arizona, my sister and I went here all the time to get shaved ice. They have a huge variety of flavors and they always make it right.\nWater and Ice is owned by lovely people who are always kind and helpful, and great to talk to. Their store has a huge selection of candy, snacks, drinks, frozen treats, etc. Everything is always fresh. Their prices are fair and it always feels good to help out a family rather than go shopping next door at albertson's.\nWater and Ice is a great place to go for a sundae or shaved ice on those hot, Arizona days!
0;"A 1 1/2 Stars from me! Dreadful! I spent the longest year of my life the fifteen minutes I spent looking for help in there! I wanted to know where the TV department was so I could look for HDTV's. No one knew where the TV department was! Finally, by use of my OWN EARS AND EYES I found it, saw high prices and left, thank God! Good service is \""How may I help you?\"" heard from many salespeople. I heard none at all, had the feeling it was because I was a white man in a store with Latino and Black salespeople. Unacceptable! Dreadful store!"
2;"I woke up early one morning and stumbled into this cupcake place...opting to skip eating breakfast at McDonalds' inside the food court, I somehow stumbled into this small place located next to the Monte Carlo Pub.  I decided to try something different for breakfast, and give their cupcake a try.   I ordered the \""Oh, My Gosh\"" cupcake, which the girl suggested as one of their most popular cupcakes.  After grabbing a cup of coffee at Starbucks, I sat down and began to dissect my cupcake.   The vanilla cupcake was filled with a chocolate ganache, topped with chocolate and vanilla buttercream.   The cupcake was moist, but the cream was a tad bit dense and way too sweet.  I would have enjoyed it more with a beer, but the sweet cupcake didn't go so well with my caramel macchiato; way too much sugar to start the day!  The cream frosting was just too thick and heavy for my liking, and too sweet.  The cupcake was $3.75 plus tax, which came out to be $4.08...honestly since when do they start charging tax on cupcakes!?  \n\n For the price of the cupcake, I did not think it was worth $4.  I would have been better off going to Jean Phillipe or Payard and getting a sweet dessert or a pastry.   Other cupcake places like Sprinkles make better cupcakes than here, but so far I have not found too many cupcake shops on the strip in Vegas.   I guess if you have a cupcake craving these cupcakes might satisfy your appetite, but don't expect these cupcakes to be breathtaking delicious.  The cupcakes seem to be okay, they definitely have room for improvement, such as making the cupcake a tad less sweet.  I will probably go back to try a different cupcake, hopefully the next cupcake will turn out better!"
1;I ordered a refill using their automated phone in option. The pharmacy at this location is severely lacking. I went in on Wednesday to pick up an Rx, they said they were having issues billing my secondary insurance, so after about 20 minutes I told them I would call my insurance and come back the next day. I called my insurance the next morning and was told there was nothing wrong on either of their ends- all authorizations had cleared on the expensive medication. Thursday, I went in to pick up the medicine, and they still had issues billing my insurance. 20 minutes later, they find out that they weren't able to bill my insurance correctly because they were trying to bill them for an incomplete prescription (they only had 7 pills rather than the 30 to fill the script). I was never told they didn't have enough medication to fill the script. \n\nThey gave me the 7 pills they had previously filled for me along with an IOU for the rest of the medication and I paid my copay.. I can't imagine that it's company policy to handwrite an IOU on a receipt for $500 worth on medication.\n\nOn a brighter note the staff was polite, although one of them seemed really annoyed at my persistence but I suppose I'd get a little frustrated too.
3;This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week. It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive. \n\nCan't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.\n\nThere is also a nice little patio.
1;When you first walk in it looks like you're about to have a great experience. However I was highly disappointed. First of all they UNSANITIZED tools on me. I was charged for a glitter that I didn't even want AND my gel nail polish chipped the next morning!!! I was not happy to pay $60 for a gel mani and a regular pedicure that didn't even last 24 hours. The one positive thing I can say is that they were extremely friendly.
3;I just ate the most expensive but the best burger ever in my life. $60 burger sounds crazy but it is totally worth it. You can taste each layer of ingredient of the burger. Foie gras, truffle, kobe beef are the best combination for burger. Fried zucchini and sweet potato fries are really good. My wife had Blackjack burger and it's very good.  Highly recommended.
1;I had some pretty high expectations for this buffet and i was disappointed. For the price 30 per person on a weekday and considering this buffets' location i expect better. The food was just OK. Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.
3;It's a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront. The few times I've been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors.   The concept is there and I will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes.
1;"The first time I tried Pro Nails, I had a pretty good experience. \n\nWhen I returned on April 7th, the place was bustling, and there were a lot more nail technicians working at Pro Nails. \n\nThe gal that did my mani/pedi was very nice. However, the quality just wasn't there. \n\nMy fingernails are different lengths, and my pedicure was very mediocre. \n\nAll in all, this was a typical \""chop shop\"" experience. \n\nWhen will I learn?"
0;Updated 8/3/2013.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I wrote the updated review below wherein I was contacted by the manager of Mastro's Ocean Club. He said he would either take our three entrees off our tab or send us a gift certificate (for the price of the three entrees). I asked him which would be easier for him and he said the gift certificate. I got the gift certificate last week...it was for $100...not even close to covering the cost of our entrees. My lobster, for example was $70...that would mean the other two entrees totaled would have had to have been $30 and we all know that the scallops and the bone-in ribeye would be more than $30 each.\n\nI am really upset. I wish I would have told the manager to have the price of the entrees removed from our bill even though it would have taken him longer to do it. Believe me, we won't be using the gift certificate anytime soon, as we are very disappointed in this whole matter. And if the manager is reading this and wondering why I didn't call him...it's like this. You didn't comp us for the price of our entrees like you said you would, and if you can't abide by your word, why should I bother calling? I'm sure you'll just have some flimsy excuse why you did what you did.\n\nI'm thoroughly disgusted with Mastro's Ocean Club...no longer a fan.\n\n*****\nThe other day after I posted my review on Mastro's Ocean Club, I was contacted by their parent corporation asking me to complete a survey and note my remarks. Yesterday, the manager of Ocean Club called me to discuss my remarks. He was very pleasant and we discussed at some length the issues I had described. He provided a very nice resolution to the whole ordeal which I thought was very nice. Needless to say, I'll be giving Ocean Club another chance and look forward to making the acquaintance of the manager.\n\nOne other positive note: after enjoying the Blufeld Reisling on my visit to the restaurant, I have been able to find the wine in the Valley. After a discussion with AJ's, they explained to me the differences in the Reidl stemware created for various wines and I now have four beautiful pieces of stemware to compliment my Blufeld. Next time I will remember to note the name of my waiter, so I can give him the praise he so richly deserves for recommending this wine.
2;Got a chance to check out Texaz grill finally. Wifey has been beggin me to go here forever and I finally caved. Not sure why, I friggin love chicken fried steak. I perused the menu, but already knew I was going for the go-to dish. we also started with an order of the fried okra. Wifey got the special, which was chicken and dumplings. Little man ordered a cheeseburger. The okra was awesome! tender, perfectly seasoned and just the way fried okra should be. My chicken fried steak was HUGE, like the size of my face. Now bigger isn't always better. The steak was just okay. Somehow with all the gravy, it ws pretty bland. The steak part tasted more like liver and the breading was a bit doughy. I wasn't blown away by my meal but it doesn't matter, it was still a good experience. the service was great, prices cheap and we didn't have to drive very far. Will I go back? probably not, but definitely glad we finally checked it out.
0;"I am stuck in Las Vegas! What's up Spirit Airlines!?? \n\nNot only was my experience one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but I also will be stuck with no where to go until tomorrow morning (over 14 hours) at no fault of my own. \n\nI was scheduled on a flight from San Diego to Las Vegas today, that was delayed. (I understand that happens) but I asked the gate agent if there would be problems with my next flight. He literally told me \""no, but make sure you run\"" (meaning to my next gate) \nWell lo and behold, I arrive, and my connecting flight was gone.  \nThey offer a flight tomorrow, no hotel, no help with getting a flight sooner from another airline, nothing. \nAnd that's \""the best she can do\"" - Ms. Avalos, in Las Vegas. \n\nWhen they are the ones that put me on the flight in the first place... Knowing my connecting flight would depart before we landed. \n\nI'm in shock that you can leave someone without anything when it is your mistake. To make it worse, there is no one else for me to speak to?! Who do I contact to resolve this situation? \n\n-one seriously disappointed customer."
1;"There was a long wait. Not sure why because there was one customer being helped and about four guys sitting around.\n\nAfter waiting for about an hour, I was told I couldn't get the tattoo I wanted on my ear because they were too small. Then when I asked if that tattoo could be done on my hand, I was told my hands were too small. \n\nAll I wanted was a Hello Kitty bow, size-wise, smaller than a quarter.\n\nBut whatever. I was ready to spend some money and the artist just shrugged and said \""oh well\""."
1;"Normally I'm impressed with Apple Store customer service. This location sucks. Every interaction I have with the staff here is rude. The girl \""helping\"" me with an exchange was asking me how to do it. Good thing I was there to help. 2 stars only because they are efficient. That's all."
0;What a crappy place, surrounded by crappy people to have to get a health card. CLOSED for lunch as we arrived... Are you kidding me? What a racket for unnecessary government fees....
0;Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar.
3;"We went in one night for dinner.  We got the large pizza and wings special with four sodas.  The staff were kind.  In fact (I believe the owner) said, \""you know it would be cheaper for you to get a pitcher of soda versus four individuals.\""  I thought that was great they told us that.  The pizza came out with the wings I would say 15-20 minutes.  We were asked if we needed anything.  The pizza was hot and had good flavor.  The chicken wings though were AMAZING.  Some of the best we've had in a long time.  Would like to see more of a variety of specials....We've been back twice since our first visit."
3;They're in NDG now! \nImagine the glee when we learned that TA was bringing its pies to Monkland Ave / Girouard!  Villa Maria is the closest Metro stop\n\nSo far the pies we've had (as take-out) are:\n\nSteak Bacon Cheese. Verdict = Delicious\n\nButter Chicken. Verdict = Oh, Yummy!\n\nSpinach, mushroom, tomato & ricotta. Verdict = Vegetarian pies, although tasty and possibly healthy are not the thing of which legends are made. \n\nNed Kelly. Verdict = OMG OMG OMG!\nWhile you can easily imagine the first three pies flavour profile you're going to have to try the Ned Kelly. It's a steak pie, with fried egg and cheese and BBQ sauce all in one magical eye-popping pie! Serve any of these pies (except for the vile veggie one) alongside some mushy peas, mashed potatoes and and a cold one and you're golden.\n\nThey've got big pies to take home and they have little pies that you can eat while you're taking your big pie home. They've really thought of everything.
3;8 times out of 10, I love this place! Occasionally they'll mess up an order but are good about getting it fixed. Also the service is slow sometimes, but other than that.. everything is tasty! It's also a really cool place to sit outside & enjoy the view!
3;We tried to find this place last time we were in town but failed.  So glad we tried again.  Got there early, got a great seat outside.  They were awesome with our son and made sure we knew about the off menu kids items.  Our server (Haley?) was great with him as well and very attentive.  The food was solid and the beer selection as well.  We will definitely be back.
3;"Dude... Food trucks, I love them so.  I can't even express the joy at the realization that Food Truck Friday exists... So many quality \""restaurants\"" to experience in a small space... You can pick a smattering from a number of places and create your own little slice of heaven... I am still a little partial to the fish tacos from the Roaming Fork, but there's a nice rotation of vittles from many of the popular trucks in the area... They even have a couple dessert options as well, which is right up my alley... There's only a few tables with benches connected, so bringing your own chair would not be a bad idea... Make sure to get there early if it's a nice night out because parking is a bear..."
1;The service could be better.  Much better.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked for our drink, which was at the same time we ordered our food.  The food was good.  Not excellent, but definitely good.  I don't think I would go back again just for the mere reason that there are other places to try.  I wasn't extremely impressed.
1;Decided to take the family out to a nice brunch, so we decided to go here. We heard good reviews so we decided to give it a try. The breakdown: Lakeview was great. The service was lagging. Constantly had to remind our server to refill waters. (Even when his section was empty). Appetizers took 30min for salmon tartare and French onion soup. By the time we got our main course we were full on bread and patience. First time here = bad experience. Food overall was ok. There's no definite wow factor.
0;I will not be using this company again.  After confirming with the person who answers the phone and schedules the appointments, Jan, that my fee would include the same services as last year's weed control, the service man, Alex, did not complete my lawn application properly.  Because I have health needs, I cannot do the follow up spray with the hose a few days after the application.  In the past, the service has always included the watering as well with no issues.  Apparently the spray wasn't completed at all.  This resulted in more weeds.  I called as soon as I noticed new weeds popping up and Jan assured me that the service man would be by that day to spray again.  I waited and did not hear anything so I called again the next day.  Jan told me there had been an emergency (bees) and he would actually be by the following day instead to spray.  At that point, I assumed it had been done.\n\nOne week later, I notice more weeds and called Jan again.  She told me that Alex had been there and sprayed and she would call him again and follow up.  She called me back shortly after to tell me that she had misinformed me-  he had come by but there were not enough weeds to spray and it was my fault that I had not sprayed the water after the initial service.  She then proceeded to attempt to sell me pest control services and charge me a re-application fee ($40) to come out and spray.  When I told her I could not do the spray myself, she was sarcastic and rude and wanted to know why.  I should not have to disclose my medical information to a pest control company.  I confirmed on the phone before I scheduled the application to avoid that conversation.  I told Jan I would not be paying and asked to speak to her manager.  She said she would have him call me back.  \n\nAn hour later, I received a call from Alex who said because of the miscommunication he would take care of coming and doing a follow-up spray at no cost.  However, he was unable to come for a few more days and the weeds wouldn't die for 7-10 days.  \n\nIt is now a week later and my yard is littered with weeds.  I have also now received a complaint from my HOA.  I will now have to hire an additional service-NOT Apco to fix what they should have addressed from the beginning.
0;A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!
2;"I've been to Aldi stores before, back when I used to live in IL, so I was familiar w/ the layout.  If you've never been, it's like a miniature Sam's Club, but with generic-brand products and no membership fees.  \n\nIf you need a cart, you may pick one up at the side of the store by depositing a quarter, which you may then retrieve by returning the cart when you're done w/ it.  There usually is just enough room for two small-sized people walking side-by-side pushing carts one-way, so just keep this in mind as you go through the store and its mazes.  Just because most, if not all of the brands here are generic, it doesn't mean that Aldi doesn't sell quality stuff!  I was pleasantly surprised to find ORGANIC turkeys sold here the day before Thanksgiving.  Too bad all of them were about 12 pounds or larger, or else we'd have bought one to try, and I'd have one more thing to review here...\n\nThe reason I wanted to post something about my Aldi visit was to say that chocolate lovers must, if you haven't already, try a few of the European chocolates sold here!  You may find them among one of the first crates to your left as you enter the store and proceed forward.  Two brands we tried were Choceur [dark choc, milk choc, and milk choc w/ almonds (those w/ a hazelnut allergy would best stay away from the almond bar-- it contains hazelnut paste)] and Moser Roth (chili dark choc).  While the Choceur milk chocolate and almond bar was delicious (not too sweet!), I did feel the room spin as soon as I had a bite (I'm able to eat toasted hazelnuts w/out problems, but hazelnut spreads and chocolate-covered hazelnuts do cause allergy symptoms).  I'm savoring a few pieces of the dark chocolate variety as I type this... Mmm, and it's so melt-in-your-mouth creamy-dreamy!  If you're a bit daring when it comes to mixing chocolate and peppers, then you may like Moser Roth's Chili bar.  I didn't find it as spicy as my baby sis did, but then again, she doesn't really like spicy dishes (she orders a \""1\"" when at a Thai restaurant that serves dishes ranging a mild 1 to an inferno 5), but the flavors harkened to the times when I tried Mexican hot cocoa and churros made w/ Ibarra chocolate....\n\nMy older sister's MIL LOVES the brownie mixes here!  I can't review it, as it contains corn products; However, the aromas that wafted throughout the house while it baked sure smelled delightful!  (The beautiful cracked surface of the brownies also teased me until I finally had to turn away before I gave in.  LOL)"
3;Went here after a day of drinking and gambling on our last night in Vegas.  There were three of us and we each had the loco moco and the Filipino breakfast which consisted of tocino. garlic rice and three eggs.  I was full, but it tasted so good that I kept on eating.  Wished they served the oxtail soup before 11pm cause I was too drunk and full to come back later.
3;I saw this divalicious show this weekend, I have seen drag shows before, but I knew them so the experience was different.\n\n We arrive at the theater and was surprised to see how cozy and comfortable the venue was. Once the show started, the set was incredible.\n\n\n Frank Marino's Divas Las Vegas was fantastic. I saw the likes of Tina Turner, Liza Minnelli, Brittney Spears, (who I thought for a second they were trying to pass a woman off as a man in drag, That is how amazing he was) Celine Deon, (who was also amazing) Diana Ross, Whitney Huston, Tina Turner, Cher, Lady Gaga, Dolly Parton, Madonna, and Bette Midler. Those I remember. I love, love, loved it. The dancers were awesome.\n\n Frank Marino had so many fantastic costume changes and was so very funny. He did Joan Rivers as well. All the costumes were amazing! I loved them. This is one not to be missed. I enjoyed it completely. Truly a drag show to see! The end scene with the man change was incredible. See it!!
3;"On our recent trip to Vegas I researched different restaurants to try - turns out that Dos Caminos AND Isla have closed. We knew we'd be in the Cosmo for the Secret Pizza (that's another review) and I wanted to try China Poblano after reading the menu on the Cosmo website. What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read!\nOK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the \""salt air margarita\"" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. \nThe wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, I\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharr\u00f3n topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). \nThe drinks were what really got me excited. After the \""salt air margarita\"" I had another specialty called a \""Mexican gin and tonic.\"" It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  I wish I had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!\nAnyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. We loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. We'll be back!"
1;"Called about a fuel leak on my cts. The service advisor didn't want to look up my information to tell me if my car had warranty coverage, and didn't want to even listen to my problem. He just kept cutting me off mid sentence saying \""get it into me\"" and gave me the impression he didn't want to be on the phone. He also told me they would not have a replacement car for me to use while they serviced my cts. After I got off the phone I opted to take the cts to Findlay Cadillac instead even though its much further from my house and I had a great experience there. See my review for them if your Caddi needs service."
1;"Ignore the glitz and glamor...this place is a waste of time.  The wait to get in is forever long.  We stood in line at 8 and didn't get to the door until 945.  Once you get in, there are 3 levels of disappointment to choose from and to get to each one, you have to walk up and down several flights of stairs.    \n\nThe bottom floor...I didn't stay on this floor long, because people were just standing around.  I didn't come to a club to stand around and people watch, so on to the next one.\n\nThe main floor was popping.  If you can't dance and want to get lucky this is the place to be.  I could barely walk to the dance floor without people brushing their sweat up against me.  When I finally got to the floor, the bouncers were telling people to move and walk the other way bc the floor was too packed.  \""That's fine,\"" I thought...\""There's always the 3rd room. \""\n\nThe top floor had chairs and tables everywhere.  The room was smaller than my hotel room.  What's the point of having an area where you can barely move and to get out, you have to walk around in a circle?! \n\nAt this point I was done with Marquee.  I just wanted to get out, but it's not going to be that easy.  I felt like I had to go through a maze of 6-7 flights of stairs, to get out of this house of horror.  For anyone that is heavily intoxicated, I will pray for you.  \n\nSo why the extra star you may ask?  Well the bathroom line was real quick and I did get in the club for free.  However, I'm sure the line was short because people would rather pee on themselves before walking out in the cold and getting lost in the maze that is Marquee. \n\nI felt like Goldilocks and the three bears.  Except that I kept on hoping for the \""just right\"" moment, but it never came and I would have rather been chased out by a bear."
3;Always a good time, especially with a group. The staff is generally professional, although our last waitress missed my gf's request of water in addition to her drink multiple times.  The comedians can be hit or miss, but if someone out the crowd says something stupid they get ripped up which is always a plus. Not for the faint of heart squares. Loosen up man.
4;"Lux is great. Set up with all the features than many-an-establishment might use to send off a douchey hipster vibe, Lux is as inviting as any other coffee shop I've visited. The staff is always friendly, the coffee is excellent, and, as an avid people watcher, it has a great atmosphere.\n\nSeating can get restrictive but, generally, they've utilized their space well so I can't fault them for their popularity. The only knock would be that the music is sometimes turned up a bit loud -- but if that's the worst it has going for it, then I guess it truly is....\""as good as it gets [five stars]\"""
0;This was by far the WORST strip club that I have ever been to! The place is huge to begin with so you have a tough time seeing the stage shows if you are seated in one of the tables along the back wall. It was completely packed as well. The dancers didn't have much personality and were over the top fake. \n\nFirst off, my wife and I purchased a couples package. They advertised that they catered to couples and when I called to schedule the limo, the girl on the phone suggested getting the prepaid package. We got there and were treated like scum because we prepaid. After reading some of the other reviews this now makes sense because they didn't have my credit card to charge a bunch of stuff to. We were taken to a crappy table and stuffed in where it was hard for the dancers to come over to us and tough to get out.\n\nWe were supposed to get $140 in drinks once we got there as part of the package. The waitress was horrible and came by maybe once every hour. We ended up getting 3 beers each the entire time we were there. Those were some really expensive beers I guess. \n\nThe dancers were really cold to us until my wife would go to the bathroom. Then they would come and bug me for a dance. Only one girl was nice to her the entire time we were there. That is the only good part of our entire time at this place. Otherwise, we actually had to approach several girls ourselves and ask them for dances. In my opinion this place is NOT couples friendly at all. \n\nWe got the limo to pick us up and take us there but once you get there you have to find your own way back. There are taxis out front but definitely plan on paying to get back to the strip at the end of the night. \n\nMy opinion is that if you are a 21 year old college kid and want to see some boobs and don't mind being packed into a place that resembles a rave club, this is your venue. If you have any maturity level at all and want to be treated with any decency then you might as well just go to any of the big Vegas shows. They are all topless and the alcohol is cheaper. \n\nWe tried The Palomino Club the next night and had a much better time. We were treated with respect, the venue is fully nude with alcohol, the women were more attractive and much nicer to us, we were never without a drink and they gave us a ride back to our hotel at the end of the night. Bottom line review from me: The Sapphire is a total waste of money!!!!!
1;I call this place Ghetto Mart. It smells like rancid grease and salmonella. But there have a been a few times (a few and only a few) where I needed laundry soap, or syrup or something. I would never buy produce here for any reason. Prices are expensive too. \n\nTempe is in desperate need of a grocery store. (Fresh and Easy, are you listening!) Ghetto Mart, I mean Rollins Market, is not the answer. You're better off making the trip a few miles south to a real grocery store.
1;We were there this weekend for breakfast, and ended up having brunch due to the long line.  It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy.
2;My mom and I were in Vegas and she was telling me all about this new show she was watching about a pawn shop. Well, look who made the #1 child spot in her book...next day I took her to the real shop!\n\nMy mom was so excited to see the store that she watches on tv. She said it looked just like the store, but none of the main people were there. They have a section for fans to buy the show merchandise. \n\nAs far as a pawn shop goes (I think this was my first ever), it was a good size (although others say small) and narrow with lots of stuff. They have a lot of cases with jewelry, random things lining the walls, and it looked like things were in pretty good condition. \n\nWe went on a Sunday when they opened so there wasn't a line to get in. However, it doesn't take too many people inside to make it feel very snug.
2;"Nice store... probably the largest Hallmark store I have ever walked into.  I'm used to the ones in the malls that are super tiny and have enough room for you to squeeze by people frantically looking for the card that \""says it all\"" for the occasion.\n\nOriginally I came here to get a box and bow for a present, but I ended up getting a gift bag instead.  The lady working gave me a ton of suggestions.  I don't know why I was dead-set on a box... I guess I need to be more creative in my gift giving practices.\n\nI couldn't really spend too much time here since I was in a rush, but I did enjoy what I saw and the selection."
1;I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE Cafe Boa! I have been coming here for 5 years. They usually have excellent menu options, fabulous service and healthy alternatives. So I figured that it would be a great place to take my out of town friends for a nice dinner. However, my visit over the weekend was less than good. Not great, good! The server was really slow. It took at least 15 minutes to get our cocktails and it wasn't like they were super busy or anything. It was a Sunday night!  There wasn't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu. Most items contained beef or pork of some sort. They were out of the wedge salad. Two of us ordered the fettucini and it was WAY too oily. Neither of us wanted to finish the dish. I think a bit of a sauce would have greatly improved this dish. One of us ordered the penne, which would have been good, had it not been so incredibly spicy. Our mouths are still burning! And our other friend ordered the fried chicken. It was probably the best option any of us had ordered, although from across the table I could see that I was probably left in the fryer just a tad too long. Our appetizers were probably the best things we all ordered. Had we just left it at that, our experience may have been better. It's probably going to be a while til I return, hopefully then they will have the issues worked out.
3;I love this store. It is so disorganized, at first glance, with everything stacked. Huge piles of... stuff! But ask the owner, he seem to know every single item in the store. And what price tag he've put on it.\n\nSaw quite some rarities, including an Atari 2600 with 7-8 games (\u00a369 incl. 2 games). Personally I fetced a couple of GameBoy original games.\n\nVinyl, dvds, video games, misc electronic equipment. It got everything - except space to actually move in the tiny store. Genuine.
0;Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.
2;Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon
1;This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.
1;"I know everyone raves about this place and maybe it was just our server but I did not have a good experience here. We waited about 7 minutes for our server to show up. No greeting and no smile. We ordered drinks and she brought then in a couple minutes - that was fine - but my wife wasn't ready to order. \""Just give me another minute,\"" says my wife. Well the sever took about 6 minutes to get back with us. Meanwhile the server for the neighboring tables had been back and forth four times.  Anyway we ordered and it was busy so we were patient. But meanwhile while waiting for our food another couple were seated near us being served by the other waitress. They got drinks, ordered and got their food 10 minutes before we did."
4;The food was all top notch one of the best steaks I have ever had. The stories of old Vegas were great from the show girls that work there.
0;"If I could give this a zero I would. When we walked in, there was a sign for \""$10 bucket of beers\"". Then we ordered two buckets of coors light. When we got our check they were $20 each!  They screwed the people around us too. I absolutely will not be coming back here. Don't waste your money of him on these scammers."
2;I had purchased the 20 dollars of food for 10 buck deal, they no longer honor the coupon, so need to communicate with Yelp to get a refund.,..  Good news is that yelp has already e mailed me about this, so keeping my fingers crossed that this is no hassle.  The restaurant in the o'aces bar is still open, and they still offer some of the same stuff such as the mad max burger.   I had the Kalifornication sandwich, was pretty good, but can get that anywhere.  I will just pick a place that has no secondhand smoke and loud drunks
4;If you find yourself in need of eyeglasses...this is the place to go.  My prescription requires a very high correction. Visited all the local vendors, Sears, Pearl Vision, Eye Glass world, Sams, Walmart. Someone mentioned Costco to me....they blew all the other vendors out of the water. They have a great selection of frames, many options are included in the price. Didn't try to up-sell to something I couldn't afford.....When you need new fames/lens this is your one stop shop
1;Such better options in Vegas! Let me just tell you that.  Decided to try Ago since we found a certificate on Restaurant.com right before our trip.  Very disappointed to get there and find out they won't accept them - make sure you get them off the site then.  The saving grace was we had the most FANTASTIC waiter.  He seriously gave us the best service and offered us some great deals instead.  Unfortunately the food was just meh. And the biggest disappointment? I asked for a side of Italian Sausage with my pasta and he said they don't have Italian sausage there. WHA?? What Italian restaurant doesn't have Italian sausage? Just another place in Vegas that is over priced, smaller portions that don't taste all that great. Find yourself somewhere else.  Oh and try to time it right -- we went right when Rehab was closed for the day and we found ourselves with a bunch of loud, drunk, hungry college kids. It's supposed to be a nicer restaurant and that just killed the mood.
1;Stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and as a top tier member, I was still given a low floor that faced that (now learned) noisy side right toward the street. I was up all night with loud noises going on at least until 2am. Very hard to sleep. Room overall was decent but the noise will keep me from coming back here in the future unfortunately.
2;"The appetizers were very good. I enjoyed the much raved about \""Griddled Corn Cakes\"" The queso was also unique and delicious.\n\nThe butter lettuce wedge salad was so delicious. They even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat.\n\nThe pork tenderloin was so tender and moist. I\""m not a huge fan of this dish in general, but they made me a fan.\n\nThey keep things interesting by having specials daily.\n\nThe servers seemed very novice. They did not remember drink orders, I found it unusual they would walk away then come right back and ask again what we said.\n\nWent on a Monday Night at 730pm. It was definitely still active at that time. I imagine weekends must be crazy.\n\nThe food and atmosphere was excellent, I was a little disappointed in the service. Otherwise would have given 4 stars."
3;Corey is the man!!!!!!\n\nIt was first time in Snots-dale or some even call it Snobs-dale, AZ for the SF Giants spring training and my girlfriends and I really had an Amazing time at Majerle's Sports Grill.....\n\nWe walked in based on the fact that we were hungry, the music and vibe of the place was what we wanted to start the night with. I especially loved the fact that this spot had about 25 huge Samsung flat screens on every wall ( a real sports grill better have a tv on every wall)!!!!! \n\nThe food, the service, and especially the manager/DJ ( Corey) really made it that much more of a hot spot throughout the night for my gf's and I that we could NOT seem to leave. We celebrated  Stephanie G's 29th b-day like a bunch of classy GIRLS GONE WILD that night! \n\nI can't wait to visit the staff and dance the night away while watching the BEST hip hop and r&b videos on all those awesome TV's!!! \n\nUntil next year Majerle's =)
3;The lentil soup is the star of this restaurant.  I wish they sold it by the gallon.\n\nYou could say Fattoush is kind of a hole in the wall, which I appreciate in an ethnic restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and seems to embody the spirit of the family owners.  If you expect fancy you may be disappointed, but if you expect a delicious meal at a fair price you'll be headed back for more.\n\nTonight I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (seasoned and served in a pita with tomatoes, pickles, and sauce) which, served with soup or salad at $6.95, was a steal.  And the tiny cup of Turkish coffee was just right.\n\nThe service is good and definitely very friendly. \n\nFattoush fits right in on that magical stretch of 19th Ave. between Indian School and Camelback, among so many great diverse food spots.
2;Pretty good supermarket in terms of selection. Otherwise I thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section. Small wine selection, but the wines in stock included a few decent picks.
0;Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed
1;Normally, I would give this place 3 or 4 stars but there were some issues last time I was there.\n\nI was with a group watching the election results (at a British Pub, of course). Service was incredibly slow. Not the server's fault, I think he was the only one. He was nice but I never actually got to order food. The first three beers I wanted were not available. What kind of British Pub runs out of Boddington? I guess we were lucky they had Guinness.\n\nIt could be a very cool neighborhood bar, but with places like The Lost Leaf, The Roosevelt, etc., they need to step it up if they want to make it.
2;Low expectations which are usually exceeded.
4;Looking for something fun to do with either a group of friends, date night or team building? Check this place out.\n\nI have never taken a cooking class before, so I was super pumped to try out Alyssa's Kitchen for the first time last night for Mediterranean Cuisine night.\n\nFour people to a station. Pick wisely... you have to cook with these people for the next couple hours. They give you everything you need. Ingredients, pots & pans, kitchen gadgets & tools... even an apron. The only thing you need to bring in (I mean that you can bring in): wine or beer. The classes are BYOB.\n\nChef Alyssa walks you through each dish and all the steps. They use a camera to put her on a big screen. She also walks around to answer any questions and help. I had a battle with my artichokes. Chef Alyssa came to my rescue to show me up close how to fight them... er, clean them.\n\nWe made three dishes last night: Stewed Artichokes, Stuffed Grape Leaves and Olive Oil cake. We were going to sear some fish too, but the fish and pans were not getting along. She improvised and showed us how to season them properly... then popped them in the oven.\n\nThis class is well worth the money. They range from $45-$60. You get to cook, eat the yummy food and get a little book to take home that has all the recipes in it. Check the schedule! There are all kinds of different classes available.. all levels. Some of the upcoming include a knife class and a Superbowl spread one. Hello spicy pulled chicken sliders. Yum.\n\nSuper convenient location too... right inside Atherton Market on South Blvd. I will definitely be back.
4;Although both JPP's in Vegas are huge, Aria edges out the one at Bellagio for selection and service.  There were also at least twice the amount of employees at this location so the line moved a lot faster.  I was able to buy some truffles and other chocolate treats to bring back home!  Quick tip: be sure to refrigerate your chocolate ASAP otherwise it'll melt in the Vegas sun!  We were lucky to have an extra mini fridge in our room so it wasn't a problem but our cousins who came along were devastated when theirs melted before they had a chance to bring them back to their hotel.  I am also noticing the reviews for the food at JPP so I'll have to add that to my list of must-eats next time I'm in Vegas.
1;"I happened to be in the University area recently around lunch time, so I quickly checked my Yelp App to see what dining options were nearby.  I found this place and decided to check it out.  When I pulled up in the parking lot, I had a bit of a dilemma as there was a Middle Eastern place right next door... but I decided to check out the Caribbean Hut since I have great Middle Eastern food in my neighborhood but no Caribbean/Jamaican places.  \n\nSo, I walked in and found that this place is one of those spots where you go up and place your order at the counter.  I quickly scanned the menu board and decided to go with jerk chicken. I asked and the girl behind the counter & she said it was served with beans & rice.  Ok - sounds good so far.  I wasn't sure about portion sizes, but I decided to go with the smaller portion size.  \n\nWhen my food came out, I was disappointed to see three little tiny pieces of chicken (which were mostly bone), rice  with only a couple of sparse beans mixed into the rice, and about half the plate was made up of some sort of slaw (WTH- she didn't tell me slaw came on the plate! I hate slaw, yuck!)  It did have 2 slices of plantains, which were tasty. \n\nWhen I dug into it, things didn't really get any better.  The jerk chicken was not very delicious - I was quite disappointed in both the subdued flavor and the terrible cut of \""meat\""...it was like 3 little chicken wings that hardly had any meat whatsoever on it.  Definitely not what I was expecting. \n\n I was expecting to dig  into a plate of wonderful calypso rice with  beans & a flavorful jerk chicken with plenty of spicy flavor. But this was just sad.  Based on the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the experience was so disappointing that I probably won't be back."
4;I was introduced to Mitchell's by a friend of mine and have been a big fan ever since! \n\nThe staff is always very welcoming and everyone at the bar always look like they're having a great time.\n\nTheir garlic parmesan wings are usually a go to for myself and friends, along with a Titos vodka of course. I look forward to many more happy hours to come!
2;Comfortably Decent\nBy no means the greatest bar in Madison, but I'd say it's quite a bit better than the handful of other bars within 1-2 blocks of it.\nThe decor is alright, but I'm easily mesmerized by a fish tank. The outdoor patio is large, but therefore quite popular. Menu is okay, but heavy on burgers. My tilapia sandwich was quite satisfactory, though. And I'm always a sucker for waffle fries.
3;I have been going to Altered Ego for a while now and absolutely love it! I recently moved to CA and still go visit them when I'm in town!\n\nLet me first start by saying that I did have one HORRIBLE experience here when I made an appointment for a partial highlight and cut with Kasondra on a whim. My normal gal did not have any available appointments so I decided to test Kasondra out-BAD IDEA. I came in and took the time to explain in detail the type of color and look I wanted. She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\n\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option. Tawni was AMAZING! She completely fixed Kasondra's botched job on my hair and made my highlights and color look phenomenal! Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\n\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome! I will never go back to Kasondra again, but Tawni's service recovery turned a horrible situation into a positive one.
0;Sadly, I will have to take this location off my option list.  I will stick with the Sahara or Fashion Show location.  So convenient to my work place but after three days in less then a week of stopping by for some treats only to be greeted with a closed venue I am going to have to give up.  I'm just not down for making another wasted trip.
1;Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back
0;"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\n\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\n\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."
0;The only star is for the one competent employee and the equipment.  Even if your bed is ready it will still take at least 30 min for anyone to clean it and even worse for the spray tan. I have emailed the company directly 3 times instead of leaving a bad review and finally heard back the last time. They gave me credit to use for upgrades but I have the highest package and could not use it towards products. Kind of pointless annoyed and about over this whole company! Don't sign up if you haven't yet! By the time you get into a bed you are just left annoyed and not relaxed at all.
2;I came here for dinner last week and found The Spot to be an okay place. The ambiance is cozy, and the service was spectacular. The food, however, was nothing special. The Spot Burger had a lot of good stuff on it, and the burger was cooked well, but the bun seemed like a regular store bought bun and the sauce on the burger made it soggy. If the bun had instead been a nice roll, I think it would have been awesome. The prices for the food are very reasonable, but the wine and cocktails are a little pricey. I'd come back and give it another try, but I don't think I'll end up being a regular here.
4;CLOSED!!!!\n\nIt is close to work, so I went back had a hot ham and cheese it was quite good and the service was much better.  Tried to go back again last week and it's closed.  No sign, emptied out.
3;So after a week in Phoenix, I had cupcaked myself out (yeah , I didn't know it could happen either).  In any case, I was still craving some dessert so I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday afternoon.  There were several people camped out on the patio, using the free wi-fi.  I grabbed a small cup of chocolate and was in heaven.  It was so rich and delicious.  I didn't think the portions to price ratio was all that bad, although I can't eat much ice cream in one sitting.  If I lived in Phoenix this place would become a staple in my life.
3;I love that you can make your own samples here. It makes the experience so much easier and makes for a quicker decision!\n\nThey also have a great assortment of flavors and toppings. You can either go healthy and fruity, or decadent!\n\nAnd really cute spoons!
0;I was excited to try this new place in my neighborhood, but the overall experience was really disappointing. Though the wait staff was friendly, they were definitely scattered. The whole table had ordered coffee, but we had to ask for milk and sugar. And then again we had to ask for the spoons. The food was even more of a disappointment. I had the bagel lox with eggs, which I was really excited about. The bagel itself was not toasted and was of poor quality. It wasn't even a Montreal style bagel! It tasted pasty. The cream cheese did not taste like cream cheese at all and was off putting. The salmon however was good. My friends had bacon with their meals, which I tried, and it was atrocious. It was plasticky to the point to which it was hard to eat. It didn't even taste like bacon. The hash browns tasted okay, but some of my friends potatoes were cold. One of my friends ordered banana crepes, but they forgot to include the bananas.  Also it took the wait staff at least half an hour to clear our plates off the table. The few good things about this pace were the coffee and friendly staff. All these problems may be due to the fact that this place is new, but these issues are pretty unforgivable. If they weren't ready to open, they shouldn't have opened. It also seemed as though though they deliberately skimped put on the quality and the food. This place definitely does not live up to the high standards of other breakfast places in the area such as Prohibition and Cafe Orange.
1;"This has been a great place to eat in Chandler.  Last nite for my BD I WANTED TO EAT AT Carrabbas again.  We have been away for a couple of years and recently moved back to Phoenix.  We went to the one on west mcdowell.  My husband told our server it was my birthday and asked if they had a birthday cake and she replied \""happy birthday I\"" ll see what we can do\"" and flashed her best coquettish smile.   Then came the food.....salad was skimpy and one or two bites of romaine the ret iceberg, slightly wilted and we each had two, yes two croutons,  then what used to be amazing hot bread was only slightly warm, and tasteless.  I wanted to return the salad but could never see our server.  Then my meal. Sirloin Marsala, runny sauce more browned than should be and mostly oily taste very little of wonderful Marsala.  Husbands chicken Bryan was way overlooked and dry the feta on top was the best part ...then garlic mashed...like soup!  We finally got server and asked for pasta instead of potato soup and asked for manager to talk to about rest of meal.  While waiting, her comes server and put a small card in front of me with three desserts and said which one would you like and I picked tiramisu ....here she comes eith candles lit \""happy birthday\"".  Thus was the best part of the meal, but not a tiramisu,  mostly whipped cream and lady fingers,  she brings chech and she charged us for the \""dessert with candles\"". My husband questioned her and she snidely said we don't do birthdays!,,,  so I said take this off the ticket you led us to believe this was for my birthday....and she said oh no you misunderstood so I said get me your manager and she threw down the check and walked away,  manager finally came over and we explained about the dessert and he removed it...ans said he would talk to the kitchen about the potatoes...??  Then here comes the server and she tossed our credit card on the table and stormed off.....so my tip for her was written on tip line...\""check you attitude\"" girlie!  \n\nReally sorry as I had good memories of food here....maybe the Chandler location hasn't gone down like this location but don't think i will find out...."
1;Only in Vegas could you make reservations at a place that threatens to charge you $50 per person if you don't show up to be seated at a plastic folding table.\n\nThe service was fine. A little slow but they tend to drag their feet a bit when they're charging you a whole lot for not much substance, it's makes you feel like you're getting more out of the experience I guess.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and watched him struggle through the menu before saying he'd have to ask the chef, which I don't think he ever did because we never got an answer.\n\nEveryone in our party said they liked their meal but no one liked it enough to finish everything on their plate which says something.\n\nTheir prices are fairly astronomical for what you get and I believe that they try to cover up what is basic food with a fancier name. Roasted Corn Soup = one of the cartons of soup from Trader Joe's, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos = raw tuna chunks with a side of commercial grade tortilla chips, Cornmeal Crusted Chili Relleno = big jalapeno popper, Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak = Chili's summer special.\n\nI'm sure there are good aspects of this place, we just didn't see them. \n\nI guess everything in Vegas is a gamble.
2;"It was Saturday and the girls had gone out to day drink. They met a host that said he could get us all in for free to 1OAK (5 guys/5 girls). So that is where we went.\n\nWe got there around 10:30 just as we were asked to. The line? to get into the club looked absolutely ridiculous. There was no order here. Thankfully, we met up with our hook (who was also helping out 30 other people). We made our own separate line that snaked through the \""mega line\"". \n\nAs our line got closer to the door, all the guys from all the groups were stopped, so all of the girls from our groups could go in. It seemed extremely unorganized compared to just about every other club in Vegas, especially the top tier clubs. The guys had to wait for about 5 extra minutes. I thought for a little bit that we were going to get swindled, but luckily we got inside. For free. The big line had barely moved.\n\nOnce inside, our girls were given 2 free drink tickets and they in turn gave one of their tickets to the guys. However, we were denied at the bar from using the tickets that were for females only apparently. So we gave the tickets back to the girls who got the drinks for us... I couldn't tell if we were outsmarting them or if they were dumber than a sack of rocks. Once I started paying for drinks, the bartenders were on point and I never waited more than 3 minutes to get a drink. I cant say the same for places like Marquee.\n\nThe layout of the club is basically an average size dance floor and a couple bar areas. There is no outside, no craps table, no places to really take a break from dancing.\n\nMeanwhile, they never close off the dance floor, they just let people pile in there like a bunch of sardines. They compound this issue by having ASSHOLE bouncers guard the bottle service tables that lie on the inside of the dancefloor. When I say guard, I mean no holding back. I was literally shoved in the back by a bouncer with a giant stupid Mohawk 3 or 4 times, forcing other people to spill their drinks on me as we collided. This guy was seriously on another level when it comes to bouncers. He was pushing another guy much larger than himself, and he would have gotten his shit rocked if that guy had lost his cool. I may have left a bootprint myself if that had happened.\n\nThe music was top 40 dance remixes with house drops. It was predictable, but still fun out on the dance floor. They also opened up a 2nd, smaller room that was playing hip-hop. The dance floor was much less packed.\n\nOverall this place was a good fun time, but had the potential of being an absolutely horrible night. I can only see myself going again if I can get in for free again.\n\nHope this was helpful."
0;Hate this airline.
4;My husband made reservations at this restaurant for my birthday dinner. We had reservations at 6:30 and had the restaurant to ourselves for a good 45 minutes before any other guests arrived. We had a window table with a fantastic view of the strip from the Stratosphere all the way down to Mandalay Bay, as this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the ivory tower in the Palms Hotel/Casino.\n\nWe arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.\n\nThe first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.\n\n1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)\n\n2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad\n\n3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras\n\n4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari\n\n5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper\n\n6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbit\n\nChef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.\n\n7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.\n\nOverall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up. Awesome!!. Walked out feeling as if we had spent the day at the spa. Totally relaxed and satisfied. Definitely recommend Alize for a very special occasion.
0;The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
3;"I stayed at the Flamingo, and figured that coming here would be a awesome place to get some grub. It may be a little touristy, but who cares.. you aren't from there! I got to Tropical Margarita GUAVA flavor and it was really good. Just a good balance of alcohol, tequila, and guava ! Blended of course! I was feeling a little ill so I ordered the tortilla soup which was pretty okay. My friends ordered the seafood mac and cheese and it had \""perfectly melted cheese both white and yellow cheese with the crisp\"" It was so good they talked about it all weekend. \nIt was also fun to see someone come out of a volcano and slide into a giant pitcher! \nSince it was touristy, prices were not cheap. $10 margaritas, and 20+ for mac and cheese! go figure :)"
0;"-THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED due to a fire-Was disappointed to find a boarded up front entry here today, website says it is closed \""indefinitely\"", but there are several other locations in Montreal."
3;I am sure it gets better... And when it does, I will let you know. UNTIL THEN this place was Fantastic. \n\nAwesome service, Portuguese speaking staff, food was fantastic and a classy environment. We got there just as they were closing . With a few tables left they seated us and never rushed us. Food assortment of meat was excellent and cooked to your desire. salad bar was fresh and well stocked. \n\nA fantastic dinner in Vegas, thank you !
2;I mostly came here for Poke Express. Poke Express is amazing. But as for Island Sushi and Grill...\n\nIt's okay I guess? I got a kalbi and tonkatsu lunch combo, but compared to Island Specialties downtown, there just wasn't very much for the same price.\n\nThere's 3 small pieces of kalbi and one medium piece of tonkatsu, plus Mac or tossed salad for $9 something. Overall decent and what I expected, but could have been more.\n\nAt least service is friendly and they are fast.\n\n3.5 stars
3;My first Cirque du Soleil experience, and LOVED IT. \n\nI was never drawn to the idea of spending large amounts of money just to see people do tricks in the area and dance around, but after seeing this awesome show I'm now hooked on Cirque du Soleil shows!  I want to see more!!!\n\nWhat made this show good was that it had a central storyline.  I've seen only one other Cirque du Soleil show, the Love by the Beatles show at the Mirage, which didn't really seem to have much of a plot to it, more like random music videos.  I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say too much...but there was a narrator in the beginning of the show who said a few words to set up the storyline, and after that there were no words spoken in English the entire show.  It's pretty cool how you can still understand the central plot when no words are spoken!  That just speaks to the complexity and greatness of the show (and I guess that's why tickets are so pricy).\n\nThe stage is awesome (it moves!) so they played on that factor a lot for their crazy stunts.  Sometimes they would be doing ridiculous tricks and I would look closer and realize that they're not harnessed to ropes!  WHAT?!\n\nThe theme was also cool, with tribal-like crazy costumes for everyone including the ushers.  Love that everyone stuck to the theme so much!\n\nBottom line: Definitely wowed!
1;"I love trying out a new sushi place. I wished it was a bit better for me.\n\nArmed with an Amazon deal I purchased for $20 for $40 worth of food, we arrived for dinner on a Saturday night. Not very busy...\n\nOur server and sushi chef was friendly and helpful. As we looked at the menus handed to us and the monitor they had set up with pictures showing a slideshow of their sushi selections, we asked about their rolls. Our server knew some, yet still turned to ask most of what we asked to the sushi chef. I guess the new menu was new to them, too...?? \n\nWe ordered the Shufflin Roll recommended by our server and the James Special. Both were tasty, yet just had a lot going on. Couple different kinds of sauces, different fishes, sometimes a dish has too many things going on. I saw something called Taco Wasabi on their specials board, so I requested one. It was pretty much tako (octopus) chopped in a small bowl with wasabi mixed in. Do not recommend ordering that.\n\nWhen I presented my phone to use my Amazon deal, another employee came to settle our check so we can pay what's leftover after our voucher. I saw our check (what we would've paid) and saw that it added up to about $32. I'm not saying they were obligated to tell us, but all I was thinking was \""Wouldn't that have been nice that they could've told us we still had $8 to use???\"" Or at least tell us what our balance was at. I'm not one to care if we go over a certain amount, especially using a voucher, because I knew we already got a deal. Anyone else understand where I'm coming from?? LOL\n\nI hate giving less than 3 stars, seeing that others did enjoy this place. Maybe I'll try again and write an update..."
2;"Blah Blah,\nInstead of a long review I will say this,\n\nIt's expensive as balls, its crowded, and very obviously a novelty experience more akin to a roller coaster ride than a gun enthusiast location.\n\nEmployees walk around with sidearms and extra ammo (why?!?!), and seem to hate life/ and or treat you like an idiot because you've never fired a machine gun so you must be and idiot.  You don't load the gun, you receive little instruction on how to operate the gun other than the requisite \""squeeze, don't pull\"" and \""feet shoulder width.\""  So when talked to like a novice, I dont take instruction well.  Pull the trigger till the gun goes click, its more fun that way. \n\nHaving been in the military and having fired many guns before, I thought it was all a bit too patronizing.  \n\nBottom line:  You pay a lot ($50) to fire one gun down range at an approximate distance of 25 ft.  The experience will last under 1 minute.\nFor what you pay the service/location/and range should be better.  Its novelty though, and IF YOU ARE UNACCUSTOMED TO SHOOTING, than you may relish in the thrill and simplicity of it all. Where else are you going to shoot a Thompson or a MP-40, full auto, with no prior training? Ppl from the UK and Australia seemed to love it."
4;Their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly !
4;So I finally got to do the zip line at night and it was soo pretty! I love the lights of Fremont St and the zip line just added to the experience. \n\nIt is CLOSED right now because they are expanding it and I cannot wait to zip line the entire street of Fremont! Not sure when it opens, but hopefully by this summer :)
2;Only 8 calories an ounce for yummy creamy indulgence that won't have the buttons popping off your shirt! They have flavors that rotate and for the full fat full flavor seekers they serve Thrifty ice cream as well. I personally feel their small is big enough. Open late, friendly too. Ask for a sample as some flavors are great and others to me are just so so.
1;"Decided to try this place based on the positive yelp reviews.  All in all the trip was a disappointment.  \n\nOur food was mediocre at best; my wife's dish was smothered in peppercorn to the point where she was crunching through the whole thing, completely inedible.  We ordered the skewers of lamb that came unseasoned and very sinewy...  lastly the pan fried buns were like McDonald's hamburgers inside of a bun so much grease that the crispy buns were completely soggy and the grease just poured out onto the plate.\n\nLastly the staff was very unresponsive.  They were sitting in the kitchen in plain sight yet my drink was constantly empty and I couldn't seem to get them interested in coming over.\n\nThe only upside was that there Mongolian beef was quite good and the menu offered quite a bit of selection but it will not be enough to warrant a return visit."
0;"I set up an appointment on WAHOO because my finger nail Got torn back and pulled out, after waiting and arriving they refused service. He said \"" I  dont remove nails, go to the hospital.\"" What's the point of an urgent care if they refuse Non emergency treatments. Since I had to choose a rating they get one star instead of 0"
3;I had the buta-burger as it was all the flavors that i love...the burger was surprising good! i didnt expect it to be as bomb as it was....i was like 2nd in line and they were crazy fast too, which is always appreciated...my only gripe is that its kinda expensive..other than that, awesome!
1;"As I noted, if I returned I would update.  Here is that update.  Honestly, the only reason I went back was because I was invited for a birthday celebration - so I basically went for the people and not the restaurant.\n\nAfter my initial review, I was asked to email the company.  After hesitating a couple weeks I finally sent an email to see what they had to say.  To this day I have not received a reply.\n\nThis visit occurred on an \""All You Can Eat Wings\"" Tuesday.  I made the decision to go with the wing special.  The wings are so-so and the flavors are boring. To me it just seems overpriced, especially since they don't include fries anymore - but instead allow you to munch on a sad nacho bar which is never restocked. All of the food just seems pricey at QSL in general.\n\nKnowing that this location and the Concord location are owned by the same company I expected a lot more out of them.  Even though the service and food in Concord is so-so.\n\nThe previous businesses in that location, for some reason, have just failed to succeed.  Hopefully they continue to make it.  \n\nI don't feel the need to return.  You can make your own decisions.\n\nThis is just an honest from-the-heart review (update) from a paying customer."
1;This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain.
1;"Remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old lady asking \""where's the beef?\""\nWell, ditto that...\nWe split the green chili beef chimi and although it tasted pretty good, there were literally three small pieces of beef with virtually no green chilis.\nAs Klohe Kardashian said at her sister's wedding, I give it six f'in months...unless they add some meat to those meals..."
3;Two thumbs up! I am not a big sandwich person but I have to say this place serves really good sandwiches and salads. The bread is fresh and just tastes great. Service is efficient even though it is always packed and there's always a line. Would definitely go back next time I have a craving for the Full Montagu.
0;"The one in Yuma, AZ was better. I had honey BBQ wings for appetizer, which were OK at best. For dinner had black and bleu burger. Didnt read menu close enuff, I guess. For $9 I got a \""slider\"" with bleu cheese dressing squirted on it. The bun was tastey...more of a dinner roll, actually. The burger was disgusting....like it was baked or microwaved or somthing. Service was friendly but slow. Took them 5 minutes to make a gin/tonic while at 40% capacity. The only thing that will drag me back into one of these restaurants is a mandatory work function. A shame since I really wanted to like this place."
3;I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley.
0;Bad service! I have been here a few times and it seems like the staff never knows what's going on. I have a Ladies VIP card which no one ever knows what it's for. One time when I came in the door they gave me a red ticket to use for my complimentary drink and the next time I asked if I needed the ticket they said no. \n\nI have been here maybe 4 times and they messed up my bill EVERY time. Even if it was just an appetizer and one drink. Not sure why I kept going back. The last time I went the first THREE beers I tried to order at the bar they were out of. Service is slow. Food tastes good, but nothing spectacular. I actually love the club music they play but it's a weird mixed-up place.
0;This company does not return calls and does not pick up the dumpster when you order it picked up!  My client called the company to have a dumpster delivered and requested a pick up 3 days later, it was confirmed and yet never picked up.  As their agent who's attempting to get the property on the market I called on my clients behalf 3 times in one day requesting a call back, giving the property address, my phone number and the day (three days prior) when it was supposed to be picked up.\n\nThey never called me back.  They never called my client and looks like I'll be driving out there again tomorrow to see if they did their job.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable company to deliver a dumpster and pick it up- DO NOT CALL Team Clean and Haul- they do not deliver what they say.\n\nT
2;What's the difference between Walt Disney and Bing Crosby? ..\n\n..\n\nBing sings and Walt dinsae .\n\nBOOM BOOM!!\n\nThis Disney shop always looks so inviting, they play music out the door and have moving window displays. When I plucked up the courage to take my 20-year-old self in, I wasn't overly excited, however. They have a great selection of toys and plastic things, the smell of plastic is overwhelming, especially in the pencil case corner. I thought I would go and look for a new pencil case - I used to have a Cinderella one that popped out everywhere if you pressed a specific button, I was so cool. However they didn't seem to stock them anymore...they didn't seem to stock anything exciting like that. \n\nMy memories of the Disney Store were exciting, things flying everywhere and talking toys going off on every aisle, but this time the store was quiet, nothing flying around and no excitement. I was disappointed, but put it down to the fact that I was 20, so I took my ex-boyfriend neice with me, and she felt the same! She didn't enjoy it (despite demanding a hannah montana schoolbag) and said she had been in more exciting ones.
0;I  recently had my fist time (very possibly the last ) with this location and I wanted to express how horrible my order was in hopes that this will contribute to helping this location be better. I ordered online and I was able to write how I wanted my sandwich which wasn't a super difficult way and when I received it I couldn't believe how bland it was and disappointing.  The delivery service was fast and convenient which I appreciated but it was my meal that was not as great. My sandwich was mostly lettuce which overpowered everything else in it, I had 1 little skinny piece of bacon, my meat was 2 very thin slices of each kind I ordered to where  I couldn't even taste it, and I had one little glop of avocado on the bottom portion of the sandwich. Moving on to the soup which was mostly cheese sauce because there was maybe 5 little itty bitty pieces of broccoli in there. I had to make more broccoli (fresh from my house) to add in there which made it amazing after the fact. We ordered around 8:15pm so we received our order right before 9pm so I am not sure if it was the night crew not wanting to make things satisfactory but at this point I would NOT recommend this to a friend to try and I myself would not want to return to eat there again.
3;Why did I wait so long to try Dickey's?  \n\nMy husband and I visited Dickey's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The smoked meats on the menu are pretty straight forward, pulled pork, beef brisket, sausage, ham, turkey and chicken - all hickory smoked in their onsite pits. Now, I know I'm in North Carolina where pulled pork is king, but I can't pass up brisket. I ordered a 1 meat plate with beef brisket. The plate comes with 2 sides and I chose the baked potato casserole and the fried onion tanglers.  Boy, did I choose right!  You get a hefty portion of meat with a soft roll with pickles and onions. You can also choose from a variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  My husband also got the brisket but got the jalapeno beans and fried okra.  He said he really liked his plate too.  The brisket was tender with a nice smokey flavor. I chose the original bbq sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment.  And to top it all off, everyone gets free soft-serve vanilla ice cream!  It's self serve and it was a great ending to a really great lunch!\n\nThe service was super, super nice and attentive. I've been plotting our next visit. We will definitely be back!  The bakers (stuffed baked potatoes) will be next on my list!
0;Not very impressed.  I had the homemade Turkey Sub and the turkey was really dry and shredded.  Imagine the worse Thanksgiving Day Dinner you ever had and throw it on a bun with two tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, provolone cheese and spices.  I expected more from the sandwich.  I asked why they called it homemade turkey and was told they roast there turkeys every night...seems like someone overcooked this bird.  \n\nThey have an award winning sandwich called the Bobbie but it kind of seemed gross...imagine someone taking your leftovers from Thanksgiving and throwing it on a bun...shredded turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberries...you lost me at the cranberries.  I did not have this sandwich but the description seemed gross.  Someone must like it because someone gave it an award!!!
3;I love coming to this store to buy cheap kitchen utensils that I use for cooking.....sure grip, teflon utensils are my weapons of choice in the kitchen.  They have them here for decent prices.  \n\nSometimes I buy stuff I use once because it's cool.....like an electric Deli Slicer.....that got used maybe 5 times and is sitting in a box in one of our kitchen cabinets.  Whatever, it's still a fun place to shop.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.
2;The restaurant is cozy and somewhat dark with a separate bar area and dining area. Service was quick and attentive. They have some different beers to experiment with and even let you sample some you're not familiar with before you commit. \n\n\nFood was OK but not great. I had half a turkey sandwich and salad. My turkey sandwich was a bit dry and bland and the salad was forgettable. As bars go and as bar food goes you could do much worse.
4;Great price for the breakfast deal $4.99 chicken steak & eggs, friendly staff good food and price. Music is little loud. But it is a bar, what can you say right ??
2;Came here just for a quick bite to eat. This I Love Burgers is located in the Palazzo Shops, just a few steps away from our hotel elevator at the Palazzo. As soon as we stepped in, the hostess seated us right away but it took the server longer that it should to come over and acknowledge us. I almost got up to leave when she came. While she was pleasant and we didn't wait to long to get our food, wait service wasn't a priority with her since she purposely hid behind the pillars to gab with staff.\n\nWhy I say she did this on purpose?? I was wondering where she was a good five minutes. Mr. B needed a drink refill. I saw her then step out from behind a white pillar at the back of the restaurant  I was about to catch her attention when she jumped back behind the white pillar and kept talking to her co worker. lol...jeez!   I guess her conversation was more important.  The Angus burger sliders and  Mac and Cheese Nom Noms were good. Portion wise just right and prices were your tourist trap prices. I expected that. Just didn't expect inattentive service. So our dining experience for this visit was A-Okay.
2;It pains me to have to pin this one down, since it's equally easy for me to imagine someone having a 5-star as a 1-star experience at Rain. So here's a menu of ratings depending on who you are and what you're looking for:\n\n5*, if you're in the mood for liquid dancing at LV's best rave, headlined by roughly monthly appearances by larger-than-life Perfecto ringleader Paul Oakenfold.\n\n4*, if you're here on a summer Sunday afternoon for the Cinevegas awards ceremony to hear Trevor Groth, Dennis Hopper and other rockstars of the independent film movement talk about cinema on the edge.\n\n3*, if you're staying at the Palms, played blackjack way later into the night than you said you would, and just couldn't be bothered to jump in a cab to Tao or XS, so you've convinced yourself that the flame throwers and acrobatics are what you really need in a club.\n\n2*, if you trekked out from the strip w/o making sure your door situation was handled and you now find yourself waiting in line on the floor of the not-entirely-classy Palms casino.\n\n1*, if you're partisan to the plush, homey, living-room ultra-lounge coddling that popped up in NYC's meatpacking district a decade ago (http://www.yelp.com/biz/apt-new-york), in LV courtesy of Steve Wynn and Victor Drai (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-las-vegas), and just recently in LA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-house-los-angeles-4). Rain is more like an industrial warehouse, save the 1984 book-burning goth hipsterness of the one on La Cienega that Lenny Nero crawls into in Kathryn Bigelow's chef d'oeuvre Strange Days.
4;This place is bomb!!! Love kimchi fried rice + 4 skewers!! HEAVEN!
4;This is the best breakfast spot on the strip!  The potions are HUGE. I'm a big eater and my wife and I could share the chicken and waffles. Biscuits and gravy is good too.  We had a large party, but the service great.  We know that large parties can be difficult to please.  Scott ( young red head guy) was EXCELLENT! He even checked on us the next day even though we weren't sitting in his section.  If you come to Vegas you have to eat here!
1;Cupcakes were decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet. I may return but it will only be to try the macaroons.
1;I must say I was rather disappointed when I called to try and do a tasting for my daughter's party that was needing a cake for at least 50 people. The lady on the phone said that they did not do tastings for cakes that were for 50 people and that they were booked for six weeks out anyway. \n\nMy husband and I used them for our weeding nine years ago and were quite please with the quality of the cake and with the service, but it seems like they no longer care, nor would they have received our business nine years ago since our wedding only was for 50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having to go with another cake place that didn't care if we were serving eight people or 1,000. Customer service is a must now a days! Two stars is for what I remember of their yummy cakes.
4;This place is by far the best Chinese take out place that I gave eaten in. I lived in NY and been to California several times and this place is just as good or better!! You get a lot if food for little money!! They are quick with their deliveries or pick up order as well!! Keep up the good job guys!!!
4;Love this place! They are always very fast, even during the dinner rush. I highly recommend the Singapore noodles! Yuummm! :)
4;I went in to John Mario's a bit skeptical - you never know what you're going to get with any given hair salon. This was the first time I'd had my hair cut in Vegas, so I went completely off of online reviews (like this one). \n\nI requested a fairly challenging hair cut from my barber, Bill. I pulled up a photo of the style I liked on my phone and showed it to him. After studying it and talking it through with me, Bill went straight to work. Watching him work with the clippers was absolutely mesmerizing - you can tell the guy is a pro. I watched in awe as he shaped my raggedy mop into a style nearly identical to the photo I had showed him just 20 minutes earlier. The end result FAR exceeded my expectations! \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend John Mario's - especially Bill. He's as talented with a pair of scissors and clippers as I've seen, and he can absolutely create the exact look you want.
0;Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles, salt, and water. No milk or cheese. Not made with love. Food made with HATE. Im so sorry the owner died. Should have taken this so called restaurant with him. I should have known the food was gonna be bad because of the bad service!!! Floyds food does not taste nearly as good as mine. Reply to my post and i will sell a real recipe for collards and real macaroni and cheese. Oh, the location milton road food excellent!! Holla at me or them to learn how to cook!!!
4;I am not sure why it took me so long to review Roy's since I have been celebrating special occasions at the restaurant for the past five years. I have yet to have a disappointing experience. The service is consistently strong, staff is always knowledgable and friendly, and the food is amazing.  I usually get the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi and it never disappoints.  I love the sushi here as well. I recently celebrated my birthday here and it was such a wonderful experience. Everyone was very pleased with their food and the service. They even offer an alternative menu for the vegeterians among us if you let them know in advance. I will definitely be returning!
0;I go here to get my prescriptions, since it is close to where I live. The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together. Going to pick up my prescription always puts me in a bad mood because of the rudeness of the staff. I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.
3;While not as spacious as Palazzo/Venetian, they do have nice rooms which comparable to Cosmo and the others. It may be the same size or even bigger. \n\nThe difference between Signature and the others is there's a stove and microwave which means you can reheat some leftovers or cook some snacks. It comes in handy.\n\nThe only negative about Signature is it's off strip. I mean, really off strip. The only way to get on strip is to take a long walk through a tunnel which leads to MGM. It's not that bad but MGM is on one end of the strip and when you want to hit up Encore, it's definitely taxi time. Also, there is no casino in here.\n\nThe parking is a little wonky too. You need to be a guest to park here and there's no self-parking, it's all valet.\n\nBesides those little details, it's a nice place to stay. Quiet, but nice.
1;"Unfortunately no one ever asked us how our food was... If they had asked- who knows- maybe they would have made an attempt to be sure we were satisfied! Bizarre rules w/ the menu. For example, \""could I have a side of veggies instead of rice or mashed potato?\"" Response- \""it will cost $6 extra.\"" We did it anyway and were much happier with the grilled zucchini, peppers & mushrooms at an extra $6. I wonder though... Why were there only olives, onions & peppers available in the veggie quesadilla I asked about? Bottom line- I took 2 bites of the tasteless margarita pizza I ordered when the veggie quesadilla sounded too boring, and no one asked if it tasted okay!! Our server also didn't ask if I wanted to take my leftovers with me (is that allowed here? Not sure_ either way though)... I would have let her know I was unhappy. Poor service. Meh food."
0;EMPLOYEES GO AWOL AND LEAVE CUSTOMERS HANGING. 40 MINUTE WAIT FOR A BURGER. \n\nEmployees were coming in and out of side door to talk with their friends. They were having great time while customers were waiting. They got the order messed up and then had to wAit 40 minutes for a to go burger. Management please do something!
1;"My team and I were trolling the strip looking for a place to eat. We decided that a burger would be simple and ideal. We found this French themed burger place inside of the Paris hotel and thought it should be good.\n When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said \""seat yourselves\""\n We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.\n He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes.\nWe finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip. \n When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the \""Perfect Pour.\"" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.\n  \nI ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time. \n It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.\n  I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.\n\nI would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here.\nThere is a Fatburger right down the strip and is worth the extra time/distance walking."
2;two words, convenient (if you are on the center of the strip) and expensive (since you are on the center of the strip). yuk gae jang is my preference for after drinking. they make it decent here. the service is good, the server was pretty attentive. everything is extra like a second serving of rice. open 24 hrs.
2;"I really want to love this place so badly. I moved into the Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood about three years ago and have watched several places fail. I've hoped somebody would buy this cute little place and make it into something great. \n\nSo, my husband, son and I went yesterday with high hopes and hungry bellies. We've been looking forward to trying it since we got a menu on the door the other day.\n\nI hope as they move into their new space, they update the decor and get rid of some of the previous owners' decor. Such a big part of going out to eat, is the ambiance. The building is so cute and there's so much potential for it, but what the original Two Hippies owner did was just plain awful.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I am unfortunately sad to report that it was just not that good. My first \""beef\"" is the beef. I originally posted that I had thought they used frozen patties, but received the nicest reply stating that they do get their meat locally and it is never frozen. Perhaps we just came on a bad day. I ordered the Loco Moco and I had to cut my hamburger patty with a knife and fork. I was also excited to try the homemade macaroni salad, but again... not so good. It was more of a mayonnaise-macaroni soup. Way to runny for my taste. But that's just me. My husband got a burger and it was okay. The best thing we got was my son's hot dog. It was just a plain hot dog with ketchup but it was pretty tasty. I'm thinking that when I go back (and I definitely will so I can give them another chance and I can support my neighborhood joint), I'm going to get one of those hot dogs. They have all sorts of exciting options for hot dogs including homemade chili (my favorite).\n\nThey do have really delicious strawberry lemonade and tropical iced tea. \n\nI feel bad writing anything bad because I'd really like to see the new owners succeed. They were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. They responded to my original post and were very, VERY sweet so I know once they work out all of their kinks, they will do well."
3;Normally the boy does not enjoy museums, but he had a lot of fun in this one.\n\nLots of historic sex toys and insane sex toys. Video clips, films, demonstrations. Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\n\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive.
0;"I found the worst place on The Strip, I think.\n\nWe walk around waiting for happy hour, drawn in by the Sangria. We get seated in the bar...\n\n...and wait...\n\nThen get service, that was largely curt and not friendly. That's fine, we're in the bar.\n\nFood was mediocre. Ordered the falafel fritters which were bland and devoid of anything resembling falafel. Sangria was ok. Wife ordered the Octopops and said the only part worth mentioning was the aioli with coriander.\n\nI would have ordered more, but after 10 minutes with an empty drink I got tired of waiting.\n\nThis is the first time in well over 10 years I've never left a tip. 10 minutes is inexcusable. I wrote down why no tip though, so I guess she did get a tip.\n\n\""No service for 10 minutes = no tip!\"""
1;The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
0;This place is a dump!   Staff is rude, the owner just wants money, doesn't care about the quality of his programs or his staff.  The overall carelessness of the owner and staff is evident by the state of facility- its filthy and in need of maintenance.  Spend your money elsewhere, this guy doesn't need more lining his already deep pockets.
4;Okay, before I can even say anything about the sandwiches here.. You MUST know that their potato salad is EXACTLY what I call a potato salad!! It's that kind with a hint of vinegar. It's a wonderful contrast to the sweet potato chunks (just the way I like it).\n\nSo, the name is cute and catchy. Me and my friends were hungry. And being hungry makes it all-the-more daring to try something new on a demanding stomach. I like hot sandwiches to of course warm my lonely belly. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. OMG my mouth just watered. Honestly it was worth trying. The Sandwiches here are filling and full of flavor. I'm pretty sure there's a sandwich for everyone.
1;"So I lived in Brazil for a couple years, and up until coming here, had never been to a sub-par Brazilian restaurant.  The only other place I had been in this area was Fogo de Chao - which was pricey, but incredible.  \n\nI imagine going to this place for lunch, would be okay.  It looked like you could get out of there for around $15 for lunch.  But for two dinners, two cans of guarana (Brazilian soda) and tip, it was well over $100.  Let me say that the quality of food & service would have been more reasonable in the $40 range.\n\nThe cheese bread (pao de quejo) was amazing - but it's impossible to screw that up.  The salad bar was worse than Sizzler.  I couldn't believe that rice & beans weren't available in the salad bar area, and all of the \""prepared\"" salads looked like they were scooped out of a pre-packaged bin.\n\nThe grilled pineapple was good, and the picanha (sirloin) was decent - but overall the meat selection was poor, and many of the pieces were dry and overcooked.  I guess when you spend $100 for a night out with the wife, you expect great service & to leave satisfied.  It just didn't happen here."
0;Lets just say i am a very easy going & understanding person & it takes a lot to annoy me. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a place like this. I was visiting AZ last weekend, friends suggested I go here since its a new place in old town. Got there around 8.30 and after 25 mins of looking for table we found one. It took another 20 for someone to take our order (we ordered food & drinks). As we waited for our food  the rude bouncers came and asked us to get up and move to the next table, we did, then a few minutes later, they told us they needed the chairs we were sitting on, and they took those as well. At this point our table had been pushed completely In front of a hugeee fan, & we had no chairs. While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened. The next part is what ticked me off- the server brought our food and placed it right in front of the fan, allowing dirt & dust\nTo be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well. Not one apology, not one 'let me see if I can find a table'. The server was nice enough to bring us 2 free beers which I didn't even touch because I was soo annoyed. But overall it was an unpleasant experience.
4;Fresh Sushi, Fresh Sushimi rolls, best Udon soup you can get in Madison ( and this is a buffet) Frog legs, Tamuri mushrooms, shrimp, and the Sunday seafood buffet is Unbelievable, even for the $20 per person price tag, it's well worth it. Fresh Wasabi too, plus Ice cream scooped out for you , not soft serve.
3;I went to Bayleaf  with a foodie Indian friend who thinks its the best in the city. At our table three got the buffet, I got Chicken Lawabdhar, my sister got Butter Almond Chicken. We ordered samosas as appetizer. With the buffet you get freshly made masala dosai. The buffet consisted of several main dishes, veg and non-veg, two soups and a lot more for $6. the chicken dishes were delicious, as were the dosai and samosa,  the rice was perfect...by far our new favorite. One thing we really liked was the food was not greasy, just fresh and delicious! It is also much more affordable- and they deliver.
0;"I have a coworker who has had several issues with the management & maintenance at The Villages at Metro apartments. After moving from one apartment to another within the same complex, she was hit with several \""hidden charges\"" that NO ONE advised her of until after it was a done deal. This started when the transfer process first started. Every time she would talk to the office, the prices would change. Finally was able to get a set price which she paid, then when she went in to get the keys & sign papers there was one issue after another, including the amount owed changing yet again!! On the day she went in to sign paperwork & get keys, they were no where near being ready for a move in (as promised). There were many, many items not completed. She patiently waited until the next morning when the movers arrived and still many things not ready. The maintenance crew left & said they would come back - never did. They finally came back days later & did some of the items that were not done, but after being in the new apartment for a couple months there are STILL several items that still need attention in the apartment - things that were never completed when she moved in. On top of all that, she then started receiving past due notices. She had spoken with the office manager when she first received the notice. The manager said it was for a cleaning deposit on the old apartment... she said since there had been such inconveniences with the whole transition and items still not being properly fixed in the new apartment that she would have that fee waived. Since that conversation 2 additional notices were sent out & the price has now tripled. She pays rent on time every month, she is a good tenant & has been really patient, but is now more than a little frustrated. She called the office again & got nothing but the run around - assistant manger \""explaining\"" all the fees, yet these were NEVER communicated to their tenant, just thrown on her account & racking up ridiculous past due fees when told she wouldn't have to pay the move out costs? Absolute BULL!!"
0;I've only been to Panera Bread twice in my life. The first time I'd only been in the United States a week. I ordered a chicken noodle soup, which was so bad I couldn't finish it. I never went back to any Panera till five years later. Last time my wife didn't feel like cooking and so on our way home we saw the Panera Bread sign and pulled in. I ordered a Mediterranean chicken flatbread sandwich. I couldn't get past the first bite. It was dry, looked unappetizing and... there was hardly any chicken in it. Needless to say, I won't be back.
3;Food was exceptional for a brew pub.  Beer was some of the best I've tried.  Service was prompt and courteous.
2;"Great ambience.  Sat out on back patio.  Felt the waitress was a bit snooty.  I think the concept of the food is great, but not so great in execution.  The guacamole everyone raved about \""made tabelside\"" was made over in a corner and brought over to the table already made.  I would have liked to watch them make it.  Was just about one large scoop and that was it.  Left us wanting more, but flacor wasn't really there.  Underseasoned and overpriced at $12.00.  And the chips were undercooked so crunchy onthe outside, but tought toward the middle.  The chicken skewers with mole sauce was dry and mole was just ok.  The sweet potatoe/french fries were just like any other restaurants, but loved the sauces.  Tacos (ckicken) were just ok.  \nThe much acclaimed pumpkin bread pudding was excellent, but only about a 3 inch square.  Just a teaser size.\n\nI think if you don't mind spending the money, can get by the snooty waitress, and want to try something different, go for it.  Everyone in the area said to try Los Olivos right around the corner for really good Mexican food."
1;"Went here with my dad and cousin. We waited 30 minutes outside. I thought to myself, \""heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!\"" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. \nMy cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.\n You get the gist.\n\nAside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.\nMaybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake. \n\nThe only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area."
4;Delicious food - eloquent, classy atmosphere and impeccable service. It's pricey but I don't mind paying for good food. There are also happy hour specials if you sit at the bar before 7.
4;Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect.
3;Was in conference at the Phoenix Convention Center and a glorious smell wafted through from the east. Turning to my left I saw a plate, and lady tearing something up..fiercely . Me and three other people immediately stopped what we were doing and walked somewhat zombie like to where the food was and asked...where did you get that? Karim's Cobbler Shop and Deli was her reply...in between bites.  \n\nNow I've been in Phoenix for 3 months looking for a taste of soul food. And here it was in my back yard! I was shocked!!!\n\nWith a sense of urgency I walked the streets until once again I was seduced by the smell of fried fish. Wasnt very far, and it was perched right in front of the Light Rail.  My kind of place.\n\nFirst thought, very humble. Very clean and neat and humble.  The owner was very kind, friendly and humble. Very confident that whatever I ordered I would love it. And I did.\n\nAs the only customer in the place I had soo many questions..How long were you here. Where do you market you store, cuz I never heard of it. With a smile he explained that his customers usually come in thru word of mouth and via the smell.\n\nI ordered the 3 piece whiting (its a east coast thing) It was well seasoned yet  non-greasy and well I wanted more of it. A side of red rice and beans which was flavorful and simply not enough.  Not usually a peach cobbler fan but it had so many intricate flavors. I sensed some clove, cinnamon, brown sugar...and something I can't quite put my finger on. The detective will be back to figure out this mystery.  It was sooo GOOOD!\n\n\nHearing so many complaints that Phoenix has alot of sun but no soul I can confidently say that there is however scatter amongst the desert.  One just have to put in the detective work. Use the senses...it will lead you there. But if you can't follow my lead.  Karim's Cobbler shop is the place to get your grub on.  Bring your families and friends too.  Everyone will leave happy. Or with an extra side :)
0;"\""Raunchy\"" is the most accurate description. Absinthe means \""strong and bitter.\""\n\nAfter seeing this, we were shocked by the ratings of 4 & 5. The four of us agreed this was the raunchiest of shows and the humor was mean-spirited to the point that it was not enjoyable. My husband and I have seen many shows; the two people we attended with have seen most of the shows (as they live in LV). \n\nThe \""humor' was a lot about body parts and body fluids. We could not understand why the ratings were so high. We then realized that for the 20's, young, juvenile humor, drinking crowd this was great. (Look at the photos that accompany the ratings . . most very young.) The acrobatics were good, not great. The seats were uncomfortable, wood, folding-type chairs. \n\nPay attention to the reviews, the term 'adult humor' words is not used because it is too mild of a term. Terms 'perverted' and 'dirty humor' were used for good reason. If you enjoy okay acrobatics, the lowest form of reality television, raunchiness, and humor based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, degrading others, and race, this is the show for you. If you expect great talent and an adult humor, burlesque-like show, pass on Absinthe.\n\nI should have looked up the meaning of the word before attending, \""Absinthe:  a green alcoholic drink that has a very strong and bitter flavor; green liqueur which is flavored with wormwood, anise, and other aromatic herbs and commercial production of which is banned in many countries for health concerns.\""  \n\nThe show is \""strong and bitter\"". Even if we did enjoy the humor, the tickets would have been over-priced based on the talent levels."
0;I had a bad experience with Matthew.  He is interested in baking in a lot of money per customer, as opposed to taking on customers to actually help them out.  My evidence is below:\n\nI called Matthew on Thursday, July 24th to ask if I could get a quote on a yard clean up.  He said yes and came out the next week.  Instead of calling me, he emails me a quote with only 2 options. 1) $375 for a major overhaul of my bushes (that I never asked for) or 2) $150 monthly to clean the yard.  (twice a month).  I only want a clean up once a month, and Matthew rejected the business. I might even have paid $150 for once a month.\n\nMake no mistake--Matthew is trying to make as much money per customer as possible--and it is in his interest to do so--not yours.  He doesnt care what you need--he wants those customers he desires.  I've seen that behavior a lot in Arizona, but being originally from the east coast I am used to hard working companies who genuinely want to help you out.\n\nStay away from Matthew.
0;Just not good. Waitress knew I hated my food and didn't offer refund, discount, or replacement. I barely touched it. It was loud and clear how much she did not give a fuck. We were one of only two tables in there, so there really isn't an excuse to have missed something or been too busy.
0;Went today to try the 50% off deal. Now this place is close to my house, I have been going for many years. I just decided to go during the promo, I pull up like normally, I noticed there were no cars. I did think this was odd. I turned my car off after the guy directed me in. I go to get out and he ask me to scoot up... Turn my car back up and move up 2inches. I then tell the guy I want the ultimate with the 50% off because it's 3pm. He tells me I need to back out and get into line (4-5cars lined up) or he can take me at without discount. He said they don't start until exactly 3pm... It was 3:02. Then why would you make me pull up? Obviously I did not know. GOOD customer service would direct the cars in and just take mine when they were finished.  I will never go out. They don't value their customers at all.
3;I went here with a group of girls and was really excited since I have wanted to go for a long time. The atmosphere is really great -- very zen-like. I don't eat sushi, but there were plenty of other options for me. I had the shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon sauce. Overall great flavor although some pieces of the lobster were just a tad rubbery (which is why I dinged my review one star). I must have been really hungry that night, because I wasn't full after my main course. So it was tempura to the rescue -- shrimp, asparagus and sweet potato. That helped tremendously. I do think the service could have been a bit quicker for our drinks, which seemed to not arrive as they should have. The waitstaff otherwise was friendly and attentive.
3;"Great Coney's.  Something about the hot dogs themselves they have a great \""snap\"" to them.  Had the cheese fries too, they did not dissapoint."
3;I love sitting at the bar, it's a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the execution was right on.  I wasn't crazy about every dish, but I was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything.  It's a pricey restaurant, but worth a visit.
4;If you are near downtown Las Vegas (or have a car to drive there) you must try these donuts.  The Lemon is filled with the same tart lemon as a lemon bar.  The Peach is filled with peach cream and topped with crumble.  Can't wait to try the chocolate.  Take these to friends, family or co-workers.  One note - the entrance is on Carson not Sixth.
3;"I have previously professed my Vegas burger love for Stripburger, but Holstein's come in a very respectable second to my favorite burger spot on the strip, if only for the price.  Holstein's is a fairly new face on the strip, but it has already far exceeded Burger Bar and BLT Burger, among the plethora of other mediocre upscale burger joints on the strip.  \n\nThe burgers are obviously top notch, and the creativity on some of the burgers is really refreshing; more importantly, it's executed perfectly.  There isn't really much else that needs to be said about the burgers at Holstein's, aside from try as many as possible, because they are all good.  What separates Holstein's from the ever growing crowd of burger spots is their appetizers.  The kimchi quesadillas, the philly cheese steak eggrolls, the incredible pork buns - there is no way to properly describe how good some of these appetizers are.  And the kicker, at least for me, is that they are different.  How many places, especially burger joints, serve kimchi quesadillas? As far as I can tell, not too many.  The incredible creativity that is seen in the burger menu is also seen in the appetizers and the rest of the menu - and again, it's all executed flawlessly.  I personally am not a big drinker, but I have tried one of their alcohol infused shakes, and it was delicious as well.  \n\nThe service here is always great, but this place can get slammed in the evenings and the bar can get rather loud, especially if there is a big game on the TVs, so I would definitely recommend this as a lunch destination if possible.  \n\nBottom line: if you're looking to spend a bit of money for a good burger, Holstein's should be your go to spot from here on out."
1;Disappointing. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was our server and the person I went with.  (so they each got a star) We had the chopped salad. Nothing on it was chopped. Why call it a chopped salad? I have done kitchen prep before so I know that this plate was sitting with friends on a tray in the fridge until our server went to go get it. It was not fresh lettuce. It was white, hard, some brown, old pathetic lettuce. We shared a pizza which he said he would have cut into 6 pieces and it wasn't. Pizza was unremarkable. Didn't ask us if we wanted dessert. If you are a server a piece of advice is ALWAYS ASK!!! If we say yes, then that's MORE TIP FOR YOU! I went once before to the Norterra location with my husband and I love me a soft pretzel so I was looking forward to trying theirs. I'm from Philly so we are used to pretzels which are sold everywhere (on the street corners to the airport) in sets of three, in a brown paper bag. Theirs was pizza dough in the shape of a pretzel. Hmm. No. The pretzels at Brat Haus were WAAAAAAY better. I probably will not go back.
0;"After waiting on the phone as \""caller number one\"" for almost 10 mins, I decided to drive in while still on hold...After getting parked and in line the casket FINALLY picked up my call. I ordered my food only to get home and it was WRONG. Avoid this location at all cost, I can't believe they screwed up my meal after all that."
0;Whatever you do - no matter how hard they ask - do NOT give these people your phone number and ESPECIALLY don't give them your email address. They are spam kings. They have been spamming me for YEARS - no matter how hard I try they never give up. They have no customer service. They are the typical sleazy used car types. The spam is unrelenting. You have been forewarned. If you feel the need to give them an email address, use a fake address or one that you don't care about monitoring because they WILL absolutely, relentlessly, for YEARS email you. No matter what.
4;My husband and I own a timeshare and decided to trade it in for staying at the Grand Chateau. I had read reviews that there was construction going on, but when we went, they were working on the inside of the rooms so we never had any noise issues.\n\nThe location is great! It's located on the southern side of the Strip right by the Miracle Shops/Planet Holleywood. They have a shuttle service that'll get you about mid-strip and drop you off at the Fashion Mall which would often times spare our feet.\n\nThe rooms were lovely. Granite counter tops, copper sinks, jacuzzi tub, duel shower heads, flat screen tv, I seriously couldnt complain. The wifi was really shoddy, but I was able to get online and make reservations while we stayed there.\n\nThey dont have a casino and are 100% smoke free which is awesome because I cant STAND the smell of cigs and it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and lay your head down to peace and quiet.\n\nThey have a small convenient store with overpriced items, but sometimes when you dont want to make the walk, it's nice to have one there. We didnt check out the pool as it was Feb when we went and much too cold so I cant comment on that. Service was always excellent and we'd DEFINITELY stay here again!
3;Check out my review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/29865866478/
3;Had AYCE lunch here. We were promptly seated and served drinks. Appetizers came out quick. Our rolls were very large and nice looking. The staff was very pleasant and quick to check on us. Plenty of rolls to choose from. Can be a bit slow as there was only one chef while we were here. Look forward to coming back.
1;Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated.
0;Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.
0;I had a terrible experience with this gym. I brought in a friend we we both joined. We both cancelled our memberships four days later because the front desk staff was terrible and neglected to explain certain requirements for joining this gym, such as requiring employment information. Very poor customer service and I caution anyone considering joining this club to either not join, or to ask to speak with a manager when signing up. The front desk girl doesn't know what she is doing. Who cares though I guess because even if she signs you up she will never even remember seeing you there OR signing you up.
2;I come here a lot. Like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar. Like that they have the automated ticket machines.
1;Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place.
4;I love Aloha Animal Hospital!  They have been so friendly and accommodating!  Every time I go in I feel very comfortable to talk to Dr Zimmerman about any questions or concerns I have and she is always very thorough in explaining and answering any questions.  They are so sweet to my pups and always leave a chocolate for us humans! Love love love them!
4;Be warned: Their sweet potato fries will haunt your dreams. They're so delicious and perfect and will call your name whenever you smell a french fry. \n\nActually... I think it's safe to say that everything on their menu will haunt you in your dreams. I've never had anything not delicious and craveable. Throw a dart at the menu and I will guarantee that it is delicious. Don't even think about splitting something with a friend because you will destroy your friendship. \n\nThe service is always on point, their bartenders are hilarious, and the ambiance is amazingly energetic.\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. Please move it to the Bay area. But until then, I will have to fly to Phoenix just to get my fix.
1;I took my friend to dinner at the Round Corner Cantina on Saturday to celebrate her birthday. We sat on the patio, there were only two other groups of people outside.  We waited for about 15 mins for someone to simply take our drink order. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas and 2 glasses of water and chips and salsa to start, margaritas came-no water.  We drank the margaritas waited for about another 20 mins for chips and salsa asked a very disinterested waitress if we could place a good order with her since we were abandoned by our waiter... Who was talking with the food runner and checking his iPhone... The waitress informed me that I could get my own water from a container across the patio--the other tables had carafes of water... We ordered the Puerco:it was pretty good and the Carnitas: very dry and disappointing.  This was a terrible experience and I am very disappointed! When we finished I started to walk over to get the bill so we could leave and go somewhere else to celebrate, the first waiter finally came over and said he would bring the bill.... Never apologizing or saying anything.... He then started talking to other waiters so he never brought the bill! I had to ask again! I asked for change for a $10 to tip the food runner... The jerk had the audacity to say thank you  as though I was giving HIM the money! I couldn't believe that any of this was really happening!  I finally got my change left money with the runner and got the hell out of there! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was a cute patio and the Puerco taco was good.  \n\nSo if you want to be ignored and treated like you are bothering the waitstaff you should check this place out.
1;"Fuel Pizza (uptown) Gets 1 star for being in uptown Charlotte' and another star for good customer service. Too bad the pizza is bland and flavorless, the side salad is colorful but lacks a good dressing to at least put it over the top. I thought the combos were too expensive for a pizza so flavorless and unexciting. \n\nYou can get a totally awesome tasting, HUGE, super slice of pizza for $6.50. Here you'll pay almost $8.00 for a drink, salad, and a decent size slice. I would say go to Sabarro's instead. You'll pay just a little more, but your meal will taste waaaay better. \n\nThe decor is interesting, but looks unfinished. The restrooms are clean, but they look nasty, with graffiti and poorly placed bathroom fixtures. I would think a \""theme restaurant\""  located in the heart of Uptown Charlotte would have a better looking design. Its a mess here. Glad I don't own this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to have it in my portfolio."
1;Had dinner here the other night, I wasn't pleased. Our waiter was AWFUL! He actually told me he'd get yelled at if my water glass wasn't full of water at all times, this was after I told him I didn't want anymore water. Really? This guys job is on the line because I drank some water? I thought he was unprofessional and noticed the his coworkers felt the same way. Then I saw at another table the server actually talking up the food and offering suggestions!! The food, well, some of it was good after I seasoned it at the table. The steak was under cooked but the salmon was good. The potatoes were bland, the Bearniaises sauce that accompanied the asparagus had separated and the asparagus itself was huge and woody, could only eat the tops.  \nThe wine was good!   I expected more from a fancy $200 meal for two restaurant.
3;I called crack ups comedy club in advance and spoke with Sidney about coming with a small group to celebrate a birthday. Sydney was so nice and accommodating . I booked our tickets with no problem. When we showed up on show night he was just as friendly in person as he had been on the phone. He welcomed us and sat us and joked around with us for a few minutes. The atmosphere was standard of smaller comedy clubs. The show was good overall. There were five comedians two were great one was mediocre and two were not so good. But that is what you expect when you go to the comedy clubs- some good and some bad. Sydney was actually one of the comedians and he and Mark were very funny. My group had a really nice time . The drinks were good and priced fairly.  I would go back.
4;Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!
3;This is a great hotel in a perfect location. Also, don't miss dinner at the Steak and Grill Restaurant. We normally avoid hotel restaurants, but our first night there were were soaked and cold and could not face going outside. The food was local, perfectly prepared, and all around fabulous. We spent the next day looking at menus around town and came back to the Steak and Grill for a second night. Prices were comparable with other places and the food would be hard to beat.
0;Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here.  While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there.  Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in...
2;Probably the most basic of all the Station properties with the Oyster Bar being the best reason to come here. The steak restaurant is a pretty decent deal for lunch too. Cheap rooms, gambling, buffet, drinks etc. \n\nI dislike the fluorescent lighting in the poker room. It makes me feel like I am in a high school biology class. I do like the sports bettors parking spots which gives action junkies a close place to park to put in their bets.\n\nThis isn't a bad place if you're on a budget and have a vehicle but I would still opt for Fremont St if I were here on an el cheapo trip to LV.
1;"I recently went here for the first time last week with my new dog. Nothing special, same items as any old PetSmart or PetCo, they carry both holistic food and the poison grocery store food as well. The female cashier was not very impressive, looked as though she didn't shower that day...very unkempt...not friendly.. \""hello\"" as people walked in but with no personality. A man in front of me said he had purchased a bag of biscuits but they were stale, had his receipt and asked if he could grab another. Instead of tactfully saying \""of course\"" and taking back the bag they would get credit for anyways, the girl sort of gave him a hassle and was unfriendly. BAD for business to act that way. Hire people who care, not local highschool kids who don't give a damn."
4;I happened upon this restaurant by accident. I stopped in for a tempura shrimp roll & ended up getting the ALL U CAN EAT. You can't beat this deal. The fish is so FRESH and the VARIETY was more than I ever expected. You have to go. The staff is friendly & very attentive. I personally sit @ the Sushi Bar as opposed to a table. Your Sushi Master is right there @ your service & they make the greatest suggestions. The one price covers everything except your beverage & it truly ALL U CAN EAT.\n\nIf you want great sushi and more for your money......YAMA SUSHI is the place to sit back & enjoy the menu.
3;I met a colleague here for lunch and we dined in the Grille area.  He works in Fountain Hills and picked this place.  It's kind of out of the way for me, but the food here is solid, so I can't complain.\n\nI had the Cheeseburger Sliders and Fries.  They were excellent.  Service here is impeccable.  The servers made sure we were well attended to and kept our drink glasses full.  I'd like to come back and have dinner sometime.\n\nThe vibe here is stuffy country club...so if that's not your deal, don't come here.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
0;Humble Pie at Desert Ridge is GREAT!  This one is much closer to my home.  I was hoping that because they are run by the same company they would be similar.  The difference is night & day.  The Happy Valley location is so poorly run I will never return.  The were 4 young women as hostesses but only one bartender.  The wait staff was very over loaded.  The bar area was too small. The crowd was very good for the 1st week of opening, but the service will have to improve dramatically to keep them coming back.
1;"what happened to the mediterranean food... when i go there now its all italian! I know italy is on the mediterranean (i hope ;) ) but what little mediterranean food they have on their menu is now just bad... this used to be a great restaurant that all my friends and i would go eat at, but now the food is just bad... Service was great though, dont get me wrong! I just didnt like their new menu... I havent done their hookah lounge and that may be good, but im not into hookahs..."
1;"I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  \""What can I get you guys...\""  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.\n\nI had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.\nFor dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. \n\nMy wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.\n\nAll in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  \n\nIf this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.\n\nThe place was not very crowded."
4;We had the pleasure of staying her for three nights in September and it just might be my new favorite place to stay in Vegas.\n\nWe normally stay on the strip, in fact our trip in April had been for a week at the Palazzo. This time we had my boyfriend's parents with us, visiting from England. They were not interested in gambling, so we thought that it would be nice to stay somewhere quieter and Tahiti Village fit the bill.\n\nWe had adjoining rooms that were absolutely massive. Our room was the bigger of the two, but they each had a kitchen area and living room. Our room had a Jacuzzi tub and a shower that converted to a steam room. So cool. The kitchens have a full size fridge and stove and had any appliance or utensil that you might need to cook dinner. The rooms were beautifully appointed and clean. \n\nThe pool is hands down the best in Vegas. It's a huge complex and we never had to worry about not being able to find a lounge chair during peak times. The  pool was full, but never felt crowded, because it was so big. I loved the lazy river. It's relaxing with just the right amount of waterfalls. Tahiti Village does not charge for tube rentals either. The pool bar had strong, cheap drinks. \n\nI really can't find a single negative about this resort. I can't wait to stay here again. Next time we are going to buy steaks and take advantage of the huge BBQ area. \n\nAfter three nights in Tahiti Village, I felt like I had spent a week in Hawaii!
1;":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("
1;The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return.
1;Gestern ging es mit 6 Freunden zu Rim Wang hier mein Fazit zu diesem Thail\u00e4nder:\nEssen: Das Essen war ausgezeichnet. Ich hatte \nGai Hoh Bei Toey (101 auf der Speisekarte) und war mit dem Essen restlos zufrieden. Auch den anderen hat es sehr gut bis ausgezeichnet geschmeckt.\nPreise: Die Preise sind angemessen, wenn auch eher an der oberen Grenze, da die Portionen nicht allzu \u00fcppig ausfielen.\nAmbiente: Das Ambiente ist Geschmacksache. Gesamturteil OK, nur der Eingangsbereich zum WC ist nicht so toll.\nService: Bis hierher h\u00e4tte das Lokal 4-5 Punkte verdient. Verbockt hat es ganz klar der Service. Unfreundlich, unwirsch, fordernd und unflexibel. Ich finde das sehr schade, da einem der Besuch in einem ansonsten tollen Lokal mit guter K\u00fcche verg\u00e4llt wird. Das dr\u00fcckt die Bewertung auf eine 2-3  eher Richtung 2.
4;I recently went here for my first time and was blown away. I absolutely loved their Green Tea smoothie. The staff was exceptional, and after hearing that it was my first time, the lady gave me a $1 off coupon and explained their punch card system to me. I will def. be returning here.
0;This place is crap. The only good thing about is the proximity to the LV Convention Center. The rooms are old, outfitted with old furniture... and around convention times, they ass rape you with $300 to $400 rates. If you are desperate to stay within walking distance to the Convention Center, great... but if you don't mind walking a little further, fighting that long line for cabs, taking a shuttle bus (during CES and SEMA, it's offered), or paying $20 to park at the Hilton, do not stay at this joint. What a waste of real estate and money.
2;OK for a Starbucks. It's very busy, which makes it noisy and the staff hurried. The furniture, especially the armchairs, are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read.
0;How many people will get fooled coming here thinking it's great Asian food? The duck was OK. It's just not worth it.  Took 2 hours to get our regular order. Other tables got up and left. Our party of 10 stayed and roughed it out. When the food finally came it was cold and we were too tired to enjoy it. So they write a few Chinese words on the ceiling and throw in some asian looking statues. Ok looks like a Chinese restaurant now. Lol. To sum it up the food sucked and the service sucker. We went to the club and it was packed. They didn't count how many just let everyone in. I think the fire Marshalls came. Am I a complainer? No! This whole facility is poorly managed. Who is the GM and where were they 1.1.2015? Fire them asap. BTW. Who serves duck with Tortillas?? Its supposed to be with Steam buns. You don't see Asians in here which means it's an expensive version of PF Changs at most. You don't see Asians at Panda Express either.  Hint hint  I dont mind spending $1000.00 for food but it better be a decent experience.  So now they can take some of that money to put into marketing and lure in more suckers. Save your money and TIME because this place will take them both from you.
0;Awful Chinese food. Probably the worst place to eat asian in the whole neighbourhood. I ordered fried won tons and I got tiny crispy noodles that you're supposed to put in the soup. Furthermore, when they include veggies in their meat dishes, they just cut them into big pieces and barely cook them. I have so many examples of why this is place is bad and I could go on for an hour, but I won't. Oh, and I forgot to mention that when I went there to pick up my order, the cook sneezed in his hands and kept cutting food without washing them!!! I have to admit that their sweet and sour soup is good though, but it's not worth the shitty main course you'll get.
2;The mainstay driving my 2-star rating is the fact that they had NO water in any of their vending machines or at the food counter. In Arizona, you must, must serve water. They had old brewed tea and Power aid drinks, but fundamentally, I can't believe they didn't have water.\n\nBatting Cages- Good\nGolf Driving Range- Good\nBumper Boats- Water was not clean and looked gross\nMini-golf- Okay\nGo Carts- Seats were really torn up and a lot of the cars didn't work\n\nThis place is operating on a thread. Minimal staff and they drained every fountain in the park to save on money. I can't totally blame them for that.
2;+_+_+_+_+ Logan's is many kangaroo hops ahead of that Australian place +_+_+_+_\n\n      Met friends for a movie and dinner. \n      The steak I and my wife had were $11.99 \n      I wasn't expecting much for this price.\n\nI'm shocked ....... the meal was outstanding.\nThe steak was tender .... tasty .... and juicy.\nFor my two sides ...... I chose a Caesar salad and fries.\nThe fries were very good.\nNext time ..... I would take a pass on the Caesar salad ...... taste wise it lacked zest and was flat.
1;If you are coming for breakfast or a burger and fries and a shake, this is your place.  I have tried 2 of the regular meals, the ground round dinner and the smothered chicken.  I had to send the smothered chicken back because it was floating in water and the green peppers on top were pickled peppers that had a sweet taste.  Not a good surprise.  This is not the place to go if you are a healthy eater, which I try to be.  I normally can find SOMETHING healthy on every menu,  but this food was too greasy and strange tasting.  The only reason we went there was a buy one, get one meal free coupon.  The servers, however, are very friendly and helpful.
2;I have dined here a handful of time. The service is good, no complaints there. But the food hasn't blown me away yet. My boyfriend and I are lovers of the Bruschetta but everything else we have tried just didn't quiet cut it. The Tuna Melt is OK but lacks originality. The drinks however usually don't disappoint although on our last visit the Sangria was terrible. I am not sure if the bartender made it wrong but it was way too sweet and not nearly enough wine was in it. I had to send it back and go with a Mojito that was OK. \nI will say that I do love the concept and the setting of the establishment. It has a good vibe and great for Happy Hour!
4;Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.
4;"Bam!  That's how excited I am to write this review.  I've had Cafe Du Jour bookmarked \""To Try\"" for over a year, and I'm angry I haven't come sooner.  We had one of our best dinners in the 'burgh the past two years.  \n\nIt was sold to me as a French Bistro - but it's really not.  None of the items are classic French comfort food, such as a coq au vin, duck confit, pate, or other type of items.  I think it falls in the New American cuisine.  Correction, it is delicious New American cuisine.  Soy-glazed meatballs ($10), pork, apple butter and brie crostini ($10), fennel rubbed pork chop with crispy kale($24), chicken breast stuffed with feta and spinach ($24), are some of the items that I can recall.\n\nThere isn't a website, and the menu you can find on allmenus seems to be a lunch menu, and outdated.  I wouldn't let that deter you at all - you just have to trust your fellow Yelpers who rave about this place.  I do disagree on the $$ designation.  Two people with 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 desert, and a cork fee was $86 (and $100 adding tip).\n\nNow, it is small, or at least while the patio is closed.  8 tables or so, and only 4 staff it seemed.  One host/waiter/runner, one chef, one sous chef, and an extra hand.  The pace between our courses was a bit longer than usual, but it didn't really bother me like it usually does.  The staff is working hard, and you can see it, and the food is so good I didn't really care.  And as mentioned elsewhere, BYOB with $2/stem.\n\nThis restaurant needs to be the next place you go."
4;Delicious, not heavy or greasy, perfect spice, great service! We had it for take out and will definitely return, yumm!
4;I don't know about $8 lobster, but $33 lobster split 2 ways was phenom! We had surf and turf at $25 each. Top notch. Next time maybe the Duck.
0;"If I could give it a 0 star rating, I would.  The awful service sent us right back out instead of eating there.  We arrived at 7:00 on a Saturday evening, which I know is a busy time.  All I wanted was to order a snack from the sushi bar.  When we got there, 4 girls were up front in some kind of disarray.  We stood there for a few minutes; no one greeted us, told us they'd be with us soon... no acknowledgment at all.  The sushi bar was practically empty, so we asked loudly if you could seat yourself.  No one replied, so we started walking to the sushi bar.  A girl then came running after us, not to greet us, but to rudely state that the bar wasn't self seating and that there was a wait since the staff was behind.  We then promptly walked out.  I did call the manager, who was very apologetic, but I still won't go back."
2;"Okay, if you're looking for a genuine Chicago Vienna Beef Red Hot or a NY Sabrett street cart dog; then you might not  understand Hot Dog Stop. HDS does sever Sabrett's but this is more of a gourmet hot dog place. \n\nThe portions are very generous to say the least and very tasty. The folks who run the place are from France and have put their own spin on things. So if you're fixed on what a hot dog should be, then go to Luke's, or Al's or even A & W; but if you want 'something completely different, to borrow a phrase, then by all means try HDS.   \n\nEnjoy!"
4;Love this place.  Of course they are famous for their frozen hot chocolate.. it is amazing. The High heel pump sandwich was very good.. The food is good and a fun place to eat.. I have to go there a few times a year...
1;I was completely miss led when i was brought here by my brother.  IN N OUT is a million times better than this place.  and frankly im not a huge fan of in n out i mean its good but nothing to get excited about.  dont bother coming here go somewhere else. shoot go to the mcDs on 59th an bell
1;I don't know how this place is busy.. Every time I go its day old bagels at best last time I had about 2 bits and trashed the rest of it.. I also tried the breakfast sand.. it was interesting to say least bagel was hard had about a bite of it then trashed it. I deffently dont plan on coming back. Service is friendly thats why I am giving 2 stars and a stretch however food is lacking.
3;We ate here for St. Patrick's Day and the food was amazing!  The weight staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had never been before but glad we did and will go again.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was great!
4;I went to the Grill Friday night with two of my girlfriends. We sat outside on the beautiful patio overlooking the golf course. There were several other people dining outside- the patio has been remodeled with new furniture, a bar and even televisions outside- so relaxing! There is a new gastropub-style menu so my friends and I got a bottle of wine and decided to try a little of everything. We had the truffle deviled eggs, cheese plate, duck confit tacos, ahi tuna, duck fat grilled cheese and kiltlifter fish and chips- everything was delicious and perfect for sharing! The wasabi crusted ahi was my favorite, but there are so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to go back and try. Staff was really friendly and attentive. Amazing menu and one of the best patios in Scottsdale!
1;"We absolutely loved this place.\n\nThe food, the atmosphere, the service are all second to none.\n\nSo why the \""3-star\"" rating?\n\nOver the top expensive!  $50 for a 12 year old?  Come on guys!   Ridiculous!\n\nBy the way, our favorite meat served was a chicken drummie that was encrusted with Parmesan cheese.  We had it last and if we would have had it first, we would have loaded up on it.\n\nAll the meats and salad bar are spectacular.  Really.\n\nOur servers were all exceptional.  It's really hard to find a better combination of food and service.\n\nI just take issue with anyone charging a 12 year old full price.\n\nLeave the kids at home and you'll enjoy a 4-star experience.\n\n\nEDIT:  Just changed to 2 Star Rating.  Why?  Their website says 12 year olds get 1/2 price.  I told our main server my children were 12 and 10.  He replied, \""1/2 price for the 10 yo and full price for the 12 yo\"".\n\nTrain your people!!!!!!  I'm now embarrassed for leaving a full 20% tip.  Damn."
1;I am not impressed with this restaurant. I came in for what I hoped to be a quick and delicious lunch, and almost two hours later I left very disappointed. The service took way to long and every placed order came to the table incorrect and had to be sent back. I really wanted to like this place but they gave me way too many reasons not to.
1;Not too impressed with this place. Their selection is underwhelming, their prices are above average and the store is cramped and congested. The employees were helpful and friendly, but couldn't help me because they didn't have what I needed in store.\n\nBecause I am often around this area, I have stopped by on numerous occasions for a product or two. One time I purchased a tent that did not contain poles and another time I bought an air pump that broke upon first using it. I had no problems returning the items, but will forever be skeptical of Big 5 products.\n\nSave yourself the time and shop at Dick's or Bass Pro Shops for a better selection, better quality and an overall better experience.
0;"Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it....\""I need to go to the bathroom...Hula's bathroom\"". That's the restaurant across the street.\n\nBest laugh I had all night"
3;"Two words, the ones to influence you when making your decision: Thoroughly. Delicious. \n\nMoving on to the specifics, highlights include:\n\nMushroom asparagus flat bread: Seriously beyond the beyond. Shaved bits of parmesan, melted mozzarella, asparagus tips, mushroom pieces and *deep breath* drizzled with blessed truffle oil. \n\nMarket salad: fresher than fresh bitter greens, candied citrus peels, balsamic vinaigrette. The market salad is not an every day option, but really damn good so if this is offered on the day you go, get it as a side to make you feel less guilty about eating all the bready wonders in this place (more to come!)\n\nSangria: True grown up grape juice. Maybe *too* much homage to Welch's.  \n\nHummus: Good. Possibly great. But the aforementioned flat bread eclipsed the shit out of it. I broke my usual rule to only order hummus in straight-up Middle Eastern restaurants. If the hummus is the only veg option in a place, fine, but there are plenty at Olive & Ivy (read: get the damn flat bread!)\n\nAnd then there's the bread that comes out before everything else. Almost focaccia, but of a less heavy texture, these slices of heavenly gluten come with a pesto dipping sauce.\n\nNote: do not come here if you're god forbid trying to avoid carbs. Not that this is me.\n\nEnvirons: oozes atmosphere, whether you dine out on the patio or the high ceiling dining room (check out the opulent private dining room which is enclosed in glass, just waiting for wannabe Prince Williams and Kate Middletons. Or even wannabe Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweeds). \n\nSpecial shout-out to our \""darling\"" (as Jeffrey H puts it) waitress."
0;"I finally came around to eating here. I'm sorry PT, but not satisfied. I'd probably only come here again because we have no choice because we usually only come here for good-bye parties, so if you're coming here just for drinks, you'll be fine... (for the most part, besides the fact that they take about 20 min to bring you out your beer, and another 15 mins to get your check.) \n\nHowever, their food is not that great... We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it sucks. and definitely wasn't worth 20 bucks for a pizza. Call me cheap, but I happen to find pizza places like hungry howies or lil caesars WAY better than this. We were even there at happy hour and our bill was still 20 bucks for just a pizza. Unless the pizza was originally 40 bucks, then i guess i got the happy hour discount, but i'm sure it wasn't. But after as long as it took for us to get our check, I didn't want to deal with the waitress because i didn't want to be there all night. Pizza took over a half hour to get there, and another 45 mins to get our check. It wasn't even worth 20 bucks in any way. It was flavorless, plain, yuck. We couldn't eat all of it so we just started giving them away lol.\n\nThe same thing with our buddies. He advised us to not order thru a waitress and go to the bar because it took forever to get his pizza and beer, so when we went to the bar instead, they wouldn't take out order because we weren't \""technically\"" sitting at the bar. Way I look at it is... We were still in the bar area, so who gives a shit!?! so we had to order thru a waitress. No big deal... it ONLY took about 30 mins to find a waitress. geez, what does it take to get some service around this place? Fuck PTs. Thats all I have to say."
2;"Took dad here after golf one day thinking it would be something a little divey and would be good in sweaty golf clothes. I think we were both surprised to see how trendy it was. The menu was great, and I really liked being able to design your own sliders... it gives you a chance to try a few different things. I had the beef with bacon, swiss, lettuce, and jalapeno aioli and it was very tasty. I agree with other reviews though, that it was overcooked. The buffalo, I had how they recommended and it was un-frikin-beleivable. There was some sort of sweet chutney on it that made the burger. I'd go back for that alone. Dad ordered the onion rings and I tried a few, they were delicious as well. Not greasy, not soggy, just right. The wait staff did seem like a bunch of rookies, our waiter even turned the baseball game on 20 minutes after we asked him to and then stated \""oh yeah I just remembered, you want to watch the game, right?\"" The food also took a while to get out to us, like 20-25 minutes long, for 3 sliders and onion rings I thought that was pretty crazy. The waitress dropped a cup of aioli next to me and scared the crap out of some people when she said OH NO! loud enough to be heard outside. We also noticed the big Delux sign across the street where they are opening up, so Stax better get it together or Delux will run them out of town. \n\n+1 for the great food +1 for a good mix of music -2 for lousy/slow service that started in the kitchen."
4;Professional ...OMG\nThis store is huge it's got a upstairs and down and it's super huge. The staff are professional and we got a ton of stuff because the staff working with us are nice and the stuff inside the store is so cute. \nThat's always a must and a plus. I took the advice of fellow yelpper Tyler B and asked for (Doc) turns out the man I was talking with was Doc (Giggles) and he's is so great. I picked out a living room set pictures to match a rug and even more. Such as plants and other items. \nBack in customer service the staff are kind & sweet and very helpful and polite. I will say if you happen to go inside ask for Doc.\nDoc is a peoples person he wont let you leave unsure or undecided he gives you time to make your mind up or change your mind about what u like what you want and that's is a plus. He says he loves how out spoken I am I'm polite but I say just whats on my mind. This location is fun and most of all your gonna love your new items. I would send my blind grand mother here I'm just being honest. These people are good trustworthy people who want to sale you cool stuff for you home.
0;If you've ever eaten good Mexican food in your life you would know this place is NOT the spot. I have no idea how it's the highest rated option on yelp.\n\n1 burrito, 2 tacos, & a drink costs $19.73. That's already a no. Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.\n\nI'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.\n\nBottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this.
2;I enjoyed this cute new spot at the district.  Service was great and outdoor seating was perfect with a view of the musician and lights in the district courtyard.  The strawberry beer was delicious.  My favorite appetizer was the sausages in the puff pastry, so yummy!  We also had the pretzel bite, fries and wings which were okay but the puff pastry was by far my fav.  Nice spot for happy hour and to enjoy a nice vegas fall night out in a relaxed atmosphere.
1;This place has sure changed...and not for the better. they totally re-did the menu and got rid of many yummy things they used to serve.\nThere are still the desserts but the little sliders are off the menu and those were my favorite!\nSo I bring my little guy here for a little dinner & chocolate treat. Our server tells me she is also a mom and whatnot. Ok lady..lets get this this started...I am with a 2 year old. I might be crazy but when the server says she is a parent I expect them to understand & TRY to be quick with things.\nThis girl was not quick..she was very very slow.\nFinally when the food arrived his grilled mac & cheese was cold. Thankfully he did not care. She offered to take it back and warm it up but there was no way he was going to go for that. He was hungry.\nWe finally order the chocolate pizza for dessert after waiting way to long for her to come back and check on us.\nThe pizza of course takes forever & I am trying to keep my kid from climbing the walls. Once it gets there tho my kiddo is in heaven. He tore into that pizza. He was in heaven. He was dancing in his chair...singing Yum Yum in my belly. It was awesome. And for that they should get 5 stars. But when I factor everything in they are down to 2 stars. Sorry Max..Prob wont be coming back again.
0;what kind of a burger king does not serve Chicken Sandwich!!!! This is like the only burger kind ive been so far that only serves one type of chicken sandwich in two style...crispy or grill...whatever happen to the fish or the orignal chicken sandwich? what a disappointment...
3;AMAZING\n\nI just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. I love this place. I can't believe it took me this long to stop in! I had the Pad Thai and eggroll. This food is fresh tasting, fulfilling, and pretty inexpensive. I would recommend this place to anyone.
3;I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices.
1;I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.
1;When I called to make a reservation at the Teppanyaki table I was given a hard time by the hostess because two of the four people in my party wanted sushi, while the other two wanted teppanyaki. They require the majority of the party to have teppanyaki but I was not about to separate my party into two tables. I think that is just ridiculous. Our waitor also seemed pissed when I told him that I wanted a sushi menu. \n\nWe were sat with a family with three children who were very misbehaved and the parents did little to aknoledge this behavior. Our server was awkward and forgot my miso soup. However, the server assistants were great. The teppanyaki chef wasn't very animated nor was his performance interesting to watch. \n\nThe sushi was good. I tried to torro scallion roll which was extremely good. I also really liked the Kho Haku specialty roll. Although these were good, it was nothing I couldn't get at the sushi place I frequent at home.
4;Breakfast was fantastic today!  We had the French toast and biscuits and gravy along with home fries and sausage. The sausage was filled with flavor. It's been years since we have been here and the new owners have done a great job of keeping the same casual atmosphere while adding a better menu. Great job!
0;Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food.  I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful, large and appetizing but Zero flavor!
4;Great ice cream! Probably one of the best in Montreal. They are only open during the summer and serve only ten flavors but they are all delicious
3;"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  \n\nThe salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  \n\nI believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  \n\nThe decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  \n\nService wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."
4;The orange beef alone is good enough to earn this place 5 stars. I thought the teriyaki chicken was a little bland, but as an out of towner, i can already say my first stop off the plane next year will be for some more orange beef. Thank goodness for yelp, because the place itself is very plain, and never would've pegged it as a place that would've knocked my socks off with the first bite.
3;We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.\n\nFirst, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. \n\nMy partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. \n\nIt was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.\n\nFor starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.\n\nThe entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.\n\nFor dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).\n\nThe food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.\n\nIt's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.\n\nSecond, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. \n\nBGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.\n\nThird, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.\n\nFourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.
1;"We went to La Cirque for Thanksgiving dinner. I knew it would be expensive but I thought if there was ever a time to splurge Thanksgiving in Las Vegas was the time. I do not mind spending a lot of money on food if it is amazing. I and the rest of our party was disappointed. The food just was not amazing. Everything was good but it was not, as my friend put it memorable. I felt everything could use salt for one thing but this place is so uber fancy that I could not bring myself to ask for it. The restaurant is really pretty, the service was good but I still want my $500 back. It was a set menu for $145 per person for a 5 course meal. There were only two choices for each course and the second choice had an up charge of any were from $15 to $65 per course, Lame. When the food came out everything was eehh. The only thing that blew my mind was the dessert. The dessert was amazing! My husband paid $65 up charge for the kobe beef and when it came out it was literally the size of a gulf ball. I was joking saying \""were is the beef\""? I know this is a french restaurant and they are known for small portions but $100 for a piece of steak the size of a quarter? I will never go again. If you have money to burn this may be a good place for you. For me our bill was $500 per couple with no booze. The food was not amazing so it was not worth it."
1;"\""Meh\"" is a good word to describe this restaurant. It is overpriced, the salad bar tastes like cardboard and the waiter was rude. He looked annoyed when my husband and I asked him if they had a wine list and he had to go in the kitchen to find out what it cost per glass. He looked even more annoyed when he realized we wanted to get a bottle and he wasted ALL THIS TIME figuring out how much it cost per glass! \n\nTheir site claims they have seafood at the salad bar... If shrimp the size of a penny and saviche are enough to claim they have \""seafood bar\"" then yes, they have a seafood bar. However, once again, even their \""seafood\"" tastes like cardboard and you have to either salt it, or pepper it, or do something with it so that it won't be completely tasteless. \n\nThe atmosphere reminded me of a high school cafeteria with dimmed lights and I don't really care for that when I spend over $30 a plate.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars was the meat - it wasn't bad, some cuts were even pretty good. Other than that, underwhelmed and unimpressed.\n\nOh, and did I mention it was really expensive? Go to Roy's, for the same money you'll get much better food and service."
2;"BLUF: You get what you pay for.  Excessive Chip Repair = Excessive Orange Peel\n\nTook my car here to get a paint job.  I had no significant body damage other than minor chips in the paint.  I did have significant oxidation to the hood and the roof.  I was painting the car the same factory stock color.\n\nThe positive: The cars paint job is a vast improvement to what was on the car prior to the paint job.  \n\nThe negative: Massive Orange Peel all over the car!  The excessive chip repair I paid for only covered most chips according to the informative panel on the wall of the shop which they were happy to show me after I showed them the remaining \""excessive\"" chips.  In fact, I'm convinced that the excessive chip repair is done by fixing the big chips, and the smaller chips are fixed by spraying on the paint on thick which causes for excessive orange peel which help to hide the chips.  Since I didn't pay for the \""deluxe package\"", I'm stuck with the orange peel paint job.  They took off the emblems and didn't put them back on.  I asked the manager if they kept them, he said they were in the glove box.  I should have checked it before I left, but I didn't.  I came home, checked and of course they were nowhere to be found.  Contacted the manager multiple times and they have yet to locate them.  They also pained over my plastic air dam at the front of the car, which was black, but now matches the car color.  \n\nI understand that when I go to Maaco I can't expect the greatest quality.   But I feel like they didn't care about me or my car to do a thorough job to where I would feel I got my money's worth.  These guys need to know that it's the attention to detail that really impresses people enough to recommend their business to others.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  The car's badges are going to cost almost $200 to replace if they don't find them.  If they find them or replace them, I'll up my rating to 3 stars.\n\nUpdate:  They found them.  I had to show up so that they would take me seriously.  So I'm upping it to 3 stars."
1;My husband and I thought we would check this place out on one of date nights. We went on a Saturday night so it was pretty packed. We walked in and saw a band playing. Acoustics were terrible. Couldn't make out at all what the band was playing but I'm guessing that it was bad 90's music. Once we squeezed ourselves through the crowd to see what we could do we saw that it was a pretty big place with screaming kids running all over. Tried to get a lane to bowl on. Was told that it going to be OVER a hour wait. Ok, that's fine. Its a Saturday night we figured, so we went to the bar to get a drink. Took forever just to get the bartender's attention and the bar area only have 5-7 people in there! Once I did get their attention I asked them to make a drink, but they didn't have apple schnapps to make it with. Okay, well I was just about to order another drink when the woman WALKS AWAY to go talk to the other bartender there! Just WOW. That was it. And I wasn't about to try to wait another 10 minutes just to get their attention again while they had their personal conversation. So we walked out of the bar DRINKLESS. We left right after that. Maybe we just didn't go on a good day, but we were pretty disappointed by the whole thing.
2;Honestly, I've had better turon. \n\nTuron.. what is that? It's a fat looking ripe banana that is wrapped in .. wrapper like a pig in a blanket. It is deep fried and then covered with caramelized sugar. There is also jackfruit inside of this crunchy concoction. I recommend eating Turon, but maybe buying it from another place.
1;This is perhaps the single most overrated place I've been to in Las Vegas.  I'm not sure why it's packed all the time except that it has a nice atmosphere and a great location.\nWas not impressed with the sushi ,the pizza, nor the drinks.  They had some gals walking around giving out beer - that was cool eye candy but I can go to about 1,000 places locally for that.\nDon't get it - prices aren't great either.  It is a nice happy hour place since the atmosphere is really cool.  But just not understanding the big appeal.
3;"Great double date place that allowed us to bring our dogs to sit at the table outside with us. Although it took a long time to get a table, the beer made up for it. As well as the BBQ chicken. The Sunday special will have me coming back for only the chicken and cornbread. \nDownside was the service, and when we were advertised the BBQ buffet, we ordered seconds and got \""the last of it,so enjoy\"". And no chicken. \nGood atmosphere."
2;"If I could rate each thing individually, I would.\n\nFood flavor and quality-always was and will be 5 star. It's incredible and I crave it. \n\nWait time-average. 3.5 stars.\n\nQuantity of food-5 star. You get tons of food. I usually get two meals out of one order that I take to go.\n\nParking-BLOWS. 1 star. Barely ever any room. You're better off parking on that side street.\n\nAtmosphere/building- 2 stars. Cramped, tiny. They really need to expand and fast.\n\nService- 0 stars. I've only had to come in here once and I don't know if I'll be back based on this alone, no matter how damn good it is. \nWe walk in to a cramped/stuffed area full of people waiting- a patron is nice enough to tell me I have to \""sign my name on the pedestal\"". I said \""I just want it to go\"" and she didn't say anything, just kind of awkwardly looked at me. I didn't sign it. All those people got seated. After waiting about 10 more min of not being acknowledged, a waitress finally asked if I was waiting for a party of people, I said no, I just want to order to go. She came back 5 min later with a menu. I told her I already know what I wanted-she was already at a table next to me saying \""yes, they were first\"". I'm aware, hence the reason they're at a table. \n\nAt that moment in time I was ready to explode \""could someone just fvcking tell me what I'm supposed to do to order to go so I'm not standing here like an asssh*le??!?!?!\""\nI was furious by the time I left. I couldn't be courteous anymore. If this is how noodle houses in Las Vegas go, they are all run sloppy and poorly organized, then white-girl-me can't deal with this, count me out. I sincerely hope other noodle-based places aren't like this, because now I really have motivation to try other ones.\n\nPerhaps to avoid confusion, I should take an asian friend with me to break the barrier a little? I heard once that it's because Monta waitresses don't understand English well-this does not excuse the poor execution of guest-ferrying and certainly doesn't welcome new people to the establishment."
0;$3 parking fee, and the valet has cones on every space. This is tantamount to a cover charge, and the food isn't THAT good.
2;I have one hell of a sweet tooth, however it's not the sweet baked good that keeps bringing me back to Bonjour Bakery & Deli. In fact, I have been into Bonjour 4 times now, and I have only bought something sweet once. It's the delicious baguettes that they serve the sandwiches on that keep drawing me back in!  \n\nFor under $10 you can get a large, delicious sandwich with a simple but fresh side salad. The full sandwiches are too much for me, so I get a half, which still comes with the salad. I typically get the ham, salami and cheese... The meats are nice and fresh, as are the veggies on both the sandwich and salad. And I love the house dressing! \n\nService has always been fine when I go in, and I am usually that person pointing and asking what a bunch of stuff in the baked goods case is... and then not buying it. I am still served with a smile, though I always get my lunch to go so I can not comment on the sit-down service.\n\nThe sweet side of Bonjour leaves a bit to be desired. There are plenty of 'bready' items (croissants, pastries, eclairs etc), which I rarely find myself craving...  They have macarons at times, however they are sold by the dozen only when they are available. I passed on those and tried a couple other items.  The mini Creme Brulee wasn't very impressive, and a bit pricey at over $4 for a small serving. The Raspberry Mousse however,  was deliciously light and rich. \n\nOverall I just find the selection of baked sweet treats a bit lacking and slightly pricey... but the sandwiches are delish and that is what keeps bringing me back.\n\nEDIT: As of June 2013 individual macarons were available at $1.75/each
4;Great gym. I loved Becky's Zumba classes and the Functional Fitness 6am classes. What really made it worth it was Cheri's helpfulness in regards to membership issues.
3;Heute noch mal dagewesen und darum gebeten keinen Geschmacksverst\u00e4rker zu verwenden, was auch ohne murren umgesetzt wurde. Der Reis hat dennoch sehr gut geschmeckt.\n\nAlso mein Tipp: Guter Laden, allerdings sollte man ausdr\u00fccklich ohne den Geschmacksbooster bestellen.
2;Excellent food but service was slow.  Sushi is good, no craft beer.  Martini made well.  Very pricey, but location it's the reason.
3;Let's start off with...wow...great selection for AYCE sushi!!! My group did AYCE which included appetizers, hand rolls, cut rolls and nigiri. You order from the menu so it's made to order, which means FRESH!!! We ordered baked mussels, fried soft shell crab, seafood salad, cucumber salad, fried tofu, edamame, cut rolls and nigiri. AYCE dinner is approximately $25 per person, this includes dessert. The server checked in on us constantly to see if we wanted anything else. \n\nThis restaurant is only about 10-15 min from The Strip. Well worth the drive!
3;If you like the one in NY, you will like this one. \n\nWhat I like about it is that the service is great, the ambience is awesome & the food is good. This is a place to go, not just because you want to eat, but because you want to indulge all of your senses. \n\nThe hubby & I went here after a show to share a small meal & enjoy the place.\nEverything was great.\nThe only thing I can complain about is that the NY location has (or had .. I don't know anymore because I haven't been in a long time) a bigger cocktail menu which included a mojito menu. I specifically remember a blackberry mojito which was amazing. Unfortunately, they don't have a mojito menu at this location.
1;the service was awful. Those girls working behind the counter were anything but accommodating and helpful. \n\nI asked if I could get no ice in my smoothie and they said no it's an ice-based smoothie and if they don't put ice it's going to be like just juice.  And it's going to be cold anyway even with no ice.    \n\n1. It doesn't take you to be a rocket scientist to realize that ice temperature is at 32 F which is significantly lower than any other liquid in the fridge.\n\n 2. Ice makes smoothie having smoothie texture? Are you kidding ? Ice IS WATER. \n\nAnd yes i would  have been fine with ice but its the attitude that's unbearable. They not only did try to accommodate, but also act like i'm crazy for asking. The only thing worse than a cooperate joint is know-it-all rude hipsters.  I much prefer Starbucks to an attitude like this. Yuck. The atmosphere was nice, but the customer service ruins everything.
0;"Horrible, just horrible! Went there last night for Korean food and the lady server was so mean to us we had to walk out of there while waiting for our food.\n\nFirst of all, when I asked her about the menu and what her recommendation was, she was like \""What do you want me to say? Just order what you like.\"" \n\nOK, shook my head and ordered. Then we asked for ban-chan and she said she is not going to give it to us until we get our meal and that we had no common sense. She tried to give us a full lecture about how traditional way of eating Korean food should be. I did not go to this restaurant to get a lecture from this lady. I am Korean and I know how to eat Korean food! \n\nI have never received this kind of customer service in my life and I really think this lady needs to learn the basics of customer service. I'm from New York and I thought at least the people would be nicer than this. This is truly a shame that she treats people of her own kind like she did. \n\nPeople, be aware of this restaurant and go to Ohya restaurant which we went to after we escaped this hell hole. The customer service was amazing at Ohya! I don't know if the food might have been better at Cafe Gahyang but I certainly do not want to eat at a restaurant that has a kind of service she provided. Good thing I don't live around this area so I don't have to think about going back there LOL"
1;Sometimes I don't like to go in because it seems dirty and some of the staff looked real tweaked.  Kind of a nice humidor but don't expect real knowledgeable staff to be of any assistance.  I think a raid of this place would turn up some  unmentionables.  Proceed with a bit of caution
3;Too bad they're closed on sunday. Definitely better than mcdonalds. I love this place!
4;The wine here is amazing! If you are not a wine person, your choices are limited but you can still find some good beer. I'm not a big bruschetta fan, but get it with salami and pesto!! Its to die for!!
2;I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.
2;A really nice experience. We get to sit at the bar and watch how each desserts are made. We had the Raspberry Lava Cake and the Strawberry Tiramisu and some Cream Puffs. The Raspberry Lava Cake is my favorite. We always had the Chocolate version and this is something new and unique. The Tiramisu and Cream Puffs are soso, especially the Cream Puffs, it's so dry that I only took one bite and can't finish it. Overall, I think this is a one-time experience thing, no need to come back constantly.
1;As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.
1;Not so impressed. First off, it smelled sorta funky in there.\n\nI ordered a monterey chicken sandwich. The avocado tasted like the guacamole spread you buy at the store, not like fresh guacamole. The fries were ok, they do give you a lot though.\n\nThree of my friends ordered the chicken pot pie. I'm not quite sure that is an accurate description of it. It was more like thick soup with two big pieces of puff pastry on the side. I didn't taste it, but they all seemed to like it.\n\nNow, I never thought I'd be disappointed by a brownie, but I was and so were all my friends. For $7 we got a not so good brownie that tasted like it was from a box and got thrown in the microwave for a few seconds and topped with ice cream. We (5 young women) did not even finish it!  \n\nOur server and her assistant were sorta awkward, maybe they were new. At the beginning of service, my friend asked to have our checks separate and I said I had a groupon, She said it wasn't a problem. At the end, the owner came and gave us a talking to because he said it was groupon's policy that they aren't allowed to have separate checks, but he was gonna go ahead and accept it this time. WTH!? I really don't see the big deal... Good thing we had that groupon because it paid for that total disappointing dessert. \n\nUnfortunately, I had expected better and was excited to try this place, but I don't think I'll ever go back.
0;"Bad service with worse food.  It's hard to screw up simple chips & queso and a hamburger, but somehow they managed to do it.  There must be a curse with the location, because apparently nothing can stay in business there; fingers crossed Kennedy's experiences the same fate and something better comes next."
1;Well I've eaten here 3 times now. It's time to write a review. Last Sunday I wanted Chinese food and J&K says they deliver. I wanted to try a new dish I read a few reviews and suggestions and from other Yelpers. Called them up at 4 PM ordered Salt & Pepper chicken and Gang Pang Beef for delivery. Well the person on the phone says it's a $25 minimum order for delivery and says it will take 45 minutes or more to deliver to my house even though I'm only 3 miles away. I really didn't feel like driving anywhere hence the whole reason for calling the restaurant in the 1st place. The manager states if I pick it up it will be ready in 10 minutes, this seemed reasonable, I agreed. I wait at the house for a few minutes and make 1 stop at CVS before going into J&K about 15 mins later and walk in to the front desk expecting my order to be ready, Nope. They try giving me somebody's else's order I tell them that's not what I ordered they ask for my phone # then tell me it's not ready. So I have to sit and wait another 10 minutes, the place is not busy it's a Sunday afternoon around 4:30. I finally get my order 20 minutes later than originally stated and go home. First off I've never had either entr\u00e9e before and didn't know what to expect but judging from appearance alone the Gang Pang Beef, it kind of grossed me out and my roommate even commented on the appearance. It seriously looked a bunch of dirty peckers covered in brown sauce. Its heavily breaded beef and suppose to be spicy with 2 peppers indicating so on the menu. Not spicy what so ever and so heavily breaded I wouldn't of known I was eating beef. As far as the Salt & Pepper chicken, all I can say is hold the Salt. That's all I could taste is salt and I know the name has salt in it but that can't be right. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy either entr\u00e9e and didn't finish them. Like I stated previously this was my 3rd and final visit to J&K. They just don't deliver on taste and quality. I love mom and pop shops and try to support small business but I will no longer go to J&K. Sorry.
4;I have been taking my doberman here for daycare for about 3 months after I was referred to them by a coworker who uses them as her vet - I have not switched to using them as my vet, but I may decide to in the future. \n\nI actually went to the facility without my dog and did a walk through and talked to the staff / trainers before I decided I would take my boy there I wanted to check it out.  I know probably a little overboard, but my dog is basically my child and I wanted to be sure that I would be comfortable leaving him there for a day - I actually visited 3 other places and this one was BY FAR the best. \n\nThe price is fair (about $17 per day for daycare) and they have a HUGE yard with grass, trees, kiddie pools, sprinklers. Last week the vet called me to say that Trey (my boy) was bleeding from his mouth - he probably bit himself or got too frisky with another dog - she said not to worry and that she would keep him in her office until the bleeding stopped. He likes to play rough so I completely understand that these things can and do happen. \n\nTo the guy who complained about his dog not being supervised and having to get stitched up: its a risk that you take when you bring your dog to a place like this - just like at the dog park things happen. What else should they have done?  Your dog got hurt and they fixed him..... I have been several times, andI know someone is always watching the dogs, but the yard is big and the dogs are free to roam around. \n\nAnother positive - their grooming prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly.
2;It was ok.  I was hoping for better service and few more choices on the menu.
2;"The prices are not too exorbitant for a movie theater that has seat-side service.  I have had some stale popcorn here and the food can be hit and miss, but other than that I really have no complaints.  On Sundays Studio Movie Grill has $5 glasses of house white wine and $10 all-you-can-eat, one-topping pizzas.  And the pizzas are not horrible; I am always leery of 'bottomless' food.  I had chicken nachos once and they were weak, lacking cheese and chicken with a huge pile of lettuce on top...more like a salad.  On the bright side, drinks are always kept topped up and seats are relatively comfortable; just make sure to get a table seat not a counter seat."
3;My esteemed colleague on Facebook just mentioned that one is now open in WEST COVINA! Yes, still far, but way closer than Vegas! AWESOME!\n\nWest Covina\n2200 South Azusa Avenue\nWest Covina, CA 91792\nUS\nPhone: 626-839-4222\nFax: 626-839-5956
4;I love Bertha's Cafe! I go there often for lunch as it is near my work. Their food is fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced! My favorite is the half sandwich half salad combo which comes with a mini cookie and bag of chips. I usually get the roasted turkey sandwich and the chopped salad for my combo and it's great! Lots of ingredients, lots of flavor. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all wonderful.
3;Food was great. Service lacking. Sat at sushi bar. Sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish. I would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service
1;Food was pretty good. Nothing too unique or memorable besides the decor, and the 60s music absolutely killed the mood. They need to keep with the theme and have instrumental chill music. Ciabatta chicken sandwich was ok. Bread lacked the traditional ciabatta flavor. Sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. Hummus was pretty good, though the pita tasted a bit raw?
4;"Staff was very courteous, we were there for a private Super Bowl party. It was all catered and very nice although the game sucked ;)"
2;"Yes, gas stations need love too and since this Shell didn't have a review, why not? The second closet gas station to Uptown Charlotte. For that reason it should deserve 5 stars, but since it's a gas station it gets 3, as well as being busy all the time with it's corner location at East & South. There are some \""characters\"" that are there from time to time, so I really never make it in the actual place as I'm a pay at the pump kind of guy. That said, it's a fully loaded convenience store/gas station. ATM, ice, beer, etc."
3;Can never get enough! Please put more mushrooms on 4 dosen't cut it.
3;"This is a beautiful botanical garden.  When we were here w/ friends several years ago there was a tram that took us around so we saw a lot more of it than we did yesterday because there was no tram.  Last time we walked through the Chinese Garden and the Japanese Garden plus saw beautiful and interesting plants and trees from the tram.  Yesterday we walked to and through the Chinese Garden, admiring the roses in bloom along the way.  Currently there is a special annual lantern festival that will be open until the end of the month.  This is its 19th year and it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Chinese Garden.  The spectacle takes months to plan, w/ the plans being drawn up in Montreal and sent to Singapore, where the lanterns are fabricated.  The completed lanterns are sent back to Montreal, where they are assembled, wired and put in place.  The theme of this year's display is the reign of the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi and his cavalry, but there are also mythical, magical creatures like dragons amid the foliage.  Lanterns are set up throughout the Chinese Garden, in the ponds and amongst the plants.  The Botanical Garden stays open later, until 9PM, for the occasion and I would imagine the lanterns are even more impressive after dark than they were in the daylight.  There are bilingual signs explaining the significance of the display and the items in it.  The Garden itself is lovely and tranquil w/o the lanterns, w/ stone \""windows\"" set in the walls looking out of the garden and walkways paved in intricate patterns of pebbles and stones.  As we left the Chinese Garden I could smell the roses, even though they weren't visible from the gateway.  There is much more to see than we saw this time but it is a beautiful garden that is worth several hours time, regardless of the season.  Just wear comfortable walking shoes, take your camera and wear sunscreen."
2;I'll keep it short, nice hotel for the price and great pool area. Close to all the good stuff.
3;It was insanely busy for a Wednesday ($3 Tequila Tastings Night) night. I didn't feel like sitting at a table so I sat at the bar and ordered a drink or two (Granada Sangira & Winterberry Margarita LURVED IT) and looked through the menu. There isn't a lot of options for food but everything that came out looked amazing from what I could see. I asked the bartenders, who by the way are extremely friendly and helpful, what the soup of the day was. Lobster Saffron Bisque. I decided what the hell let's go for it. Out in came in this huge ass bowl. It was definitely a lot larger than what I expected good enough for two people to split. It was good but I don't think I could finish an entire bowl of it. I took it home. Next on the menu that I order was the Yucca fries. Nothing special I couldn't survived without it. Last but not least the flour-less chocolate cake. Dear god (or whomever resides up above), thank you for chocolate and thank you for that delicious cake. All in all my experience was good. Definately going back again with a group of friends!
1;"Went here and needed 2 tires replace - which went well. Went back a couple of days later for a Realignment. \nHad early appointment, and 2 hours promised by salesperson. Things going okay until salesperson called me (in mall shopping) about an hour later and tire turned into two (both rear with shims on both needed) - salesperson re-promised same time (? - I expected a little longer).\nUpon returning at appointed time - was told another hour and was told \""who promised that time & that was before we found out shims for both needed\"". \n- The senior store person seemed irritated that the previous salesperson had over-booked the shop, made promises and then left for a few days off.\nDidn't leave until 40 minutes after official 8pm close........6.5 hours after arrival and 4.5 hours after original promised time.\n-Did receive 25% discount after asking for a discount.\n\nNote: They told me I was very patient."
0;Dannys Car Wash is the WORST car wash in Arizona. HORRIBLE customer service. Manager Juan Delgado at the Tempe Marketplace location is a total jackass.\n\n I brought a BRAND NEW car to Dannys for a minor windshield repair and they TOTALLY RUINED the windshield.  \n\nTo make matters worse, when I went to the General Manager (Juan Delgado) to complain about this issue he was extremely rude, laughed and blew me off.\n\nSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE CAR WASH CLOWNS.
4;Better than Starbucks. No contest! And super friendly...doesn't feel like a franchise.
2;We have been coming to the Dragon Noodle for years. The food is good, the prices are a little high and the service is okay. I agree with some of the other Yelpers. If you sit in the back section of the place it is a bit gloomy. We liked the place before the remodel. It had cheesy decor and t-shirts for sale. \n\nAfter a long day at a trade show we just want to relax and not venture too far from the hotel. The Dragon Noodle is never that busy so you can usually get a table for any number of sized party. \n\nWe hardly ever order from the sushi menu since the prices look high and we have never have been thrilled with what we have had in the past.\n\nOur group sticks to the Chinese menu and is always satisfied with the portions and taste. Our favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Wonton Soup. A group of 6 of us ate last week for $140.
1;The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday.
0;"Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl \""Lucille\"". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen."
4;Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.
4;The place is clean, well maintained and as a rule you don't have to wait for machines or weights. The staff is very amiable/helpful.  There are a variety of fitness levels of the patrons (beginners to buff). It strikes me the clientele are on the more mature side.  My wife does the classes and yoga (which are included in the membership).  She says he are well done.  Membership prices are reasonable.  The trainers are good but I think a bit spendy.  I have been a member of a few gyms and this one is one of the better ones. I would recommend this facility without reservation.
3;We very much enjoyed our dinner here but will echo what another writer said, which is that the meal goes very fast...almost too fast.  I wish they would leave another minute or two between the courses just to give folks an opportunity to truly appreciate all the fine favors of the dishes.  The chefs move so fast and announce the dishes so quickly, that some of the meal felt like a blur.  \n\nThe only other suggestion I would have would be for them to do a bit more of the preparation in front of the diners instead of just the plating.  Some of the various processes they talked about sounded really interesting, but we didn't get to see that aspect of the preparation, which was a bit disappointing.  I expected that they would be cooking in front of us, not just preparing the final products.  \n\nOther than that, the food was spectacular and the service was outstanding.  When we asked questions about the various dishes, the chefs were more than willing to explain how the dishes were made.  I wish they gave more explanation up front, but I guess some diners are more interesting in the process than others and the chefs are just trying to keep everyone happy. \n\nUnfortunately, we had some real duds at our dinner - four guys who managed to be late for dinner and then showed about zero interest in the meal.  I couldn't believe how rude these guys were, especially given the cost of the meal.  But the chefs were gracious and didn't seem to mind all that much.\n\nAll in all we had a wonderful dinner and definitely recommend the experience.
0;from the moment we arrived to the time we left completely poor customer service. our reserved room wasn't, the rooms are not well appointed (eg. no conditioner, no refrigerator, poorly cooled, all the businesses we delt with there were either slow service or just didn't care. we also tried to contact the manager and left a message with the assistant and we never heard back, clearly they don't care.\n\nwe go to Vegas for the whole experience not just to gamble and party. this place is not one we will return to...ever
1;"We've been here twice. Food is decent, but the service is horrible. From the time we sat down it took us about ten minutes to get WATER. After we ordered, it took 30 minutes for our SALAD to arrive. Yes, lettuce in a bowl took 30 minutes. Both times it was not busy, half full dinning room or less. If you have all day and you aren't very hungry, the food is decent, but if you'd like to enjoy yourself with out the pause of, \""where the hell is ____\"", and \""how long ago did we ______\"",  go somewhere else."
3;I've been here twice for brunch and really enjoyed it. The Veggie Island breakfast was delicious, good coffee, and prompt friendly service.
2;"We had shared an appetizer platter and it came with a relish tray (what a great side!).  We were pleased with the cheese curds, but the idea of \""shrimp toast\"" is not what I'd thought it to be.  It was simply shrimp salad with a side of white toast to put it onto.  For my meal, I tried the portobello mushroom burger.  I felt it was better without the top piece of bread.  It was ok, but nothing special.  The mushroom didn't melt any part of the cream cheese so I had two chunks of cheese to finagle.  Because it was someone's birthday, we were greeted with the traveling band singing to our birthday girl and had a small birthday cake to share.  It was a good chocolate cake.  Our server allowed us to separate our bill, so it was very nice to have that ability.  From what I hear, they has a spectacular brunch."
1;I had both a red tinga as well as a chili verde gordita. I also enjoyed a large cup of the best Horchata in Las Vegas. Fresh and warm, the gorditas were filling and good.....but not great. Good for a quick stop, but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored, spicy, authentic gordita. The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.
0;Appears to be out of business, no web site, phone disconnected and nobody there!
0;Horrible service!!! Family and I decided to eat Mexican food and chose this establishment to have dinner at.  We wanted to see what was their dinner special and they frowned upon that right away.  They brought us warm tap water and semi cold beer. When they brought us our food they just set it on the table and left without saying if there is anything else we need which we did. They never checked up on us to see if we needed another drink. The food seemed like it was canned food. I specifically asked for no onions and it seems like I said add all the onions u have in the back. No one person that I went with enjoyed the experience let alone the food. This is one establishment we will never go to again!!!
2;I love their burrito's and could eat them daily if I didn't have to worry about weighing 400 lbs. The problem with this place is the parking stinks and if you go at a busy time (lunch) it is packed and isn't quick to get in and out. This keeps me from going as often as I would like.
2;Had a pitcher outside and people-watched for an hour. \n\nLots of outdoor seating which is good but I didn't check out the inside or try any of the food.
3;Loved the Happy Hour!  Their bartender Frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  Taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious.  We came back every day of our stay.
2;It's like the cliche Mexican grill. Large tables.  Cheesy decor.  Beer promos everywhere.  At least at Las Glorias, the food actually tasted good.  \n\nThey bring you liquidy salsa and chips to start.  I had a burrito with rice and beans.  This place is a solid 3 stars, but since this is AZ Las Glorias Grill is 3.5 stars.  It really is hard to find decent Mex place there.
2;The prices were great, but they were out of stout...\n\nI was a bit crowded and that left the staff super spread out... Our table faced the kitchen door and it was obvious they only had two cooks in the kitchen, I wonder how the dining room got so croweded?  But for the price I don't mind having to wait for our food, beg for water and the check.\n\nI will say the people watching was priceless!  It looked like perhaps a convention of middle-aged mid-west salesmen had hit the place hard just before we were seated! Hilarious :)
4;(1st review of 2013!)\n\nMy goodness, Scott Conant - you gave us THE best meal in Vegas, EVER!\n\nLocated in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Scarpetta's chic, dark, ambience welcomes you and your party (I observed some ranging from business meetings to bachelorette parties and everything in between, with different types of seating arrangements to  match) and the vibe was always cool and collected. The service felt disconnected - I would've removed 1 star because of that, but the food was so superb that I won't! We didn't have reservations because it was a last minute decision to dine there, but we were seated right away regardless.\n\nWe skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. My eyes went straight to the DUCK & FOIS GRAS RAVIOLI! My heart jumped for joy realizing that fois gras is completely legal to sell here! I ordered it and it was the right decision! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. It was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. Definitely unforgettable! My husband enjoyed his TAGLIATELLE (with fall vegetables, truffle zabaglione & guanciale) - it was very comforting and hearty.\n\nWe were full, but were able to make room for dessert: NUTELLA AND VANILLA CREME BOMBOLONI which consisted of Nutella ganache, caramalized bananas & Nutella powder. WOW! The bomboloni (like donut holes) were lovely fluffy and crispy, filled with either chocolate or vanilla cream. The bananas were fantastic, as were the ganache and powder, adding decadent levels of texture.\n\nSo glad our impromptu evening of dining led us to Scarpetta. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1;Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n6 Food\n7 Service\n3 Atmosphere\n7 Value\n\nNot my first time to Pita Jungle - just my first time to this one.  And I'm not a fan.  It feels.... wrong.  The tables, chairs, and booths would fit much more at Hanny's than a Pita Jungle.  Sometimes nicer isn't always better.  Such as when it makes the place feel really weird and like they're either a) trying too hard, or b) out of touch with their offerings and audience.  Also, the massive mirror on the east wall hardly angles down at all, meaning that people pretty much get a great reflected view of the ceiling.  For as long as this place was waiting to open, I just feel like it wasn't done well.\n\nThe food was middling:  My girlfriend's was overly garlicked and mine was blas\u00e9 - but neither was bad.  The vodka tonic she ordered came in a wine glass.  wtf?\n\nI like the Pita Jungle in Tempe that I can get to via Light Rail, but I unfortunately have to pass on this one that's walking distance from my home :(
0;Colleagues and myself had lunch here before leaving PHX a few days ago...we walked in to find only a couple of tables occupied -that might have been the first clue, however it was already around 12:30 pm on a Thursday so we gave them the benefit of the doubt on that one.\n\nThe hostess turned out to also be the waitress and the bartender because apparently there was no one else around. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to order drinks, then it took another 15 minutes before they showed up, and that was after I told her we were on a tight deadline to get to the airport.\n\n We ordered the fried pickles as appetizers - HORRIBLE barely describes them. They had been fried earlier and apparently stuck in the microwave to warm up because the coating was rubbery and greasy. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich - 2 small pieces of grilled chicken with barely a smear of buffalo sauce, the fries - no exaggeration here, had clearly been fried earlier and dunked in oil again. They were oil soaked and dark and definitely not fresh.\n\nThe only item that looked vaguely decent was the Quinoa salad, however, one of the girls didn't get her shrimp with it as she ordered and it wasn't until she was done eating that they showed up - they were kind enough not to charge us for them.\n\nOverall very disappointing  - service was lacking, food was bad, not a place I ever plan to set foot in again.  I think Dierks should probably stick to music and leave the food to someone else!
1;Too many slots, and not well laid out. There are very few table games, so the few they have tend to be overcrowded. The bars were overpriced and understocked. There was a three-hour wait to get into the restaurants, but they wouldn't take reservations before hand. For my first trip to a casino, it was fun for a while, but that quickly wore off. I wouldn't be inclined to hurry back.
2;This place is good but was better with the previous owners. Regulars/betters would get a few drink tickets for making bets and it was a nice courtesy. It still has some appeal but they generally only run free events on TV or HBO boxing. UFC, Strikeforce, and other events take a back seat. You can bet but need to go somewhere else to watch them. Sportsbar attached is nice with many beers to choose from. If you like wine-they used to have some half way decent ones- they are down to some really poor picks. Mixed drinks they got it all. This review is about the sportsbook and connecting bar only.
0;"Alright. Not a good place, plain and simple. The complex is dirty and nearly everything is broken. Only 2 gates work... kinda. The \""Fitness Center\"" is actually just a closet with a broken elliptical machine and a broken weight machine. Of the 5 pools advertised, only 1 is ever open. The one behind the office. Which would be fine... except that everyone in the office watches you as you swim. There are homeless people all over the complex, begging, sleeping behind the dumpsters, and what ever else they want to do. My car was stolen, despite the \""security\"" provided, and broken into 2 more times. There was a fatal shooting in December that management never spoke of. Last week they found another dead body and ruled it a homicide again. There are drug deals that happen, graffiti everywhere, and the kids of the complex run around as a gang. I've seen them kick dogs, knock down and elderly woman, and once even try to sexually accost a woman before people stopped them. Management couldn't care less about anything. They are constantly making errors in book keeping, charging you more for rent than you owe, or charging you less, then charging you double for their error. Cockroaches everywhere, broken appliances, playgrounds with trash and needles in them. \n\nIf you move here....Good luck. Dont believe my review? Sign a 6 month lease and see how long it takes for you to want to run away. Wish I could give this a negative rating..."
4;These guys have the right attitude when it comes to product and service.  They are consistently top notch.  Their people are well trained and always very friendly.  Dutch Bros is easy to give a 5 star rating for their great coffee and even better service.
3;Parking lot for Primanti Bros. customers, \ncentralized location, downtown in the strip district,\nhospitable staff and very homey feel,\nfast and efficient service,\ngood pastrami on soft Italian bread stuffed with french fries and coleslaw!!!!\nya,\nits kinda like that.\nblack and yellow black and yellow!
2;Decent service and a decent bone in prime rib (get it rare though). I mean other than the dinner coming with a baked potato and tossed salad, the place is a ok. A note would be to choose a wine that is good when you open it and you'll be ok, I got the La Creme Pinot, it turned out to be a 2008.\n\nOther than that it's like a outback steak house, Just at a casino...\n\nEnjoy.
2;This is the main store, but it's also in a few strip clubs around town including my club (rhino) good selection of clothes, shoes, and jewelry. Sadly, I wish some of the people were friendlier. And they had more of a selection if clothes. I dont know maybe that's just me.
3;The food would be 3 stars but the service made it 4 stars.   Our cute waitress Tashja made the meal.  Super friendly and personable, but best of all she knew the menu and made great suggestions.  \n\nThe North Boulevard drink was Yummmm...pretty dangerous because you couldn't taste the alcohol but could tell more than one would get you pretty messed up.  Like happy lemonade.  Fried Pickles were great, super crunchy.  \n\nI had the Ahi Tuna burger...yes, I went to a burger joint for tuna.  It was very good.  \n\nHubby had Turkey burger which he thought tasted a little weird.  Just eh.\n\nSandwiches are definitely not very big as others have said.
0;All of the various cancer charities run by the Reynolds family are SCAMS. They pay themselves a fortune and give $0.02 for each dollar raised to people suffering from cancer. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
2;Glad to c another restaurant with some raw food options.  Would be nice if they had some fresh pressed green juices and some raw salad options.
2;I went here with friends and we tried the vegetarian stew and the vegetarian kebab. The stew was too sour and the lentils slightly undercooked. I would not recommend it. However, the kebab was quite good and their zarashk polo was fantastic. Among the appetizers dolmeh were some of the best I have had, but the hummus was ordinary.
0;"I've been to other Doctors Express locations and loved them, so when my 4 year old got sick, I didn't hesitate to take her the one on Camelback.   Well, the waiting room is clean and the staff were nice. However, the doctor at the Camelback location was absolutely horrible. He spent less than one minute examining my daughter and then looked at me and asked, \""Well what do you think I should do?\""  In the end he misdiagnosed my daughter and seven days later I had to go to another urgent care where they told me she had pneumonia.   If you have to go to this urgent care, refuse to see the old, male doctor. He's far from decent."
0;"Iv had decent and bad experiences here, but this morning I left pretty pissed. \nThis could be a corporate complaint more than the actually store complaint.\nI ordered a smoothie and oatmeal for like 7 bucks, after entering my number into the point pad It said I have 3 dollars off so I decided to use it. Then the cashier told me okay 6 bucks and some change. I asked why it said I got 3 dollars off and my price only dropped a dollar. She said \""because you got a meal, to redeem your 3 dollars off I took away the meal and charged everything full price\"". SCAM\nI own a salon and I would not say okay tank tops are 2 for 20... help someone with a 4 dollar off coupon then ring in the tank tops full price so she can receive the discount.\n\nI was really pleased by the new point system they are offering but don't be shady about it and change prices of the original order. Honestly could care less to return to a Jamba juice."
1;"Courtney's review is pretty much spot on. I can't think of a better way to describe the show other than Rick Thomas revels in himself. Between his magic tricks, he talks about how he followed his dreams and shows weird, outdated video segments about his life. Like the video of him doing the cha cha with his sister when he was 14 while the words \""You go boy!\"" fly across the screen. ?? I came for magic and tigers, Rick. Not to see your weird home vids. Rick also repeats some crazy nonsense about dreams throughout the show. And I don't mean cutesy, Disney, 'follow your dreams' stuff. More like weird philosophical theories that make you say, \""wtf is he talking about?\"" Also, the show tended to bob between the magic of childhood and him dry humping his sexy assistants on stage. All in all, it was pretty ridiculous and made my jaw drop several times. But I still had a great time with friends because we laughed about it long after the show ended."
4;"This is Zan- Janet's wife.  I just got back from getting my hair done with Vee at Hair Nirvana.  After much dread in trying to find a stylist I can trust out here in Scottsdale, I can happily say; I found him!  When I first found him here on Yelp, after pages and pages of stereotypical \""Scottsdale Salons,\"" I knew I had found something special.  The salon itself is also a store, filled with organic hair products, fair trade products- many handmade by refugee Tibetan monks, products handcrafted by Native Americans he knows and purchases from directly, and more.  It's a beautiful little shop, and my wife Janet- who is an SGI Buddhist- enjoyed browsing while Vee tended to my hair.  \n\nNow, I'm painfully shy and socially awkward, and I always dread having to find someone new to do my hair- but the moment I walked in and Vee greeted me, I felt at ease.  Perhaps a little too much, as my nerdy rambling quickly took over the conversation.  He's a genuine, friendly guy that can make you feel as if you've known him for years.  I could totally picture him hanging out with my motley crew of friends and fitting right in with us weirdos (in a good way).  That aside, I went in only for a cut... but he had a fantastic deal on touching up my highlights, I simply had to take advantage of it.  My hair looks fantastic, smells even better, and I look 10 years younger.  The fact that he is such a stickler for natural, organic and sulfate free products makes me respect and like him even more.  I hate having my photo taken, but wanted to include a photo of how great my hair looks, anyway.  That's how much I love what he did.  He truly listened to exactly what I wanted, and did exactly as I asked- but made it look even better than I had pictured it in my head.  A win-win.  I'll be back to Vee from now on... I am a new, loyal client.  Thanks, Vee!"
2;Everytime I go to Vegas we stay at different hotels just so we can try them out and find the right hotel. MGM was pretty nice but the room we had which was the Celebrity Spa Suite had outdated furniture.\n\nI still had a good time. This casino is huge! Lots of places to visit and the monorail is in this casino as well. Food court and all. So pretty much everything you need is in this hotel. Tabu Lounge, Studio 54 and much more.
0;Absolute and complete incompetence.  I've had to spend over two hours and numerous phone calls to figure out why I am being charged erroneous amounts on my credit card from DS Water, aka Sparkletts Water.  Upon updating my credit card in late June with their accounting department, they not only were charging my current account each month, but also my past closed credit card account.  They were tacking on insufficient funds fees and stating I owed them money when I was current the entire time.  Finally, after getting to a manager, she apologizes that they made a mistake and it will be fixed.  By this point, I was furious and simply asked that they cancel my account and pick up the cooler.....note, I have been a customer for over 7 years!!!  They blamed it on a system merging problem when they purchased O Premium Water but that doesn't make any timing sense.  While she did her best to save the account, I had just had it.  I had to explain the story three times and the first two times I was told I owed more money, but when I finally got to a supervisor, the story changed, apologies were made and reassurance that my account was current and that all the fees that were charged in error would be reversed.  Still, I can't continue to patronize a company that blames the consumer first and then researches the problem to find it was their fault.  So, that was last week, they picked up the cooler the next day, took all the empty and unused bottles, and that should have been the end of the story.  RIGHT?!?!  Wrong.  Today, again, another charge on my account, are you kidding me?!!?  Another 25 minutes on hold to be told yet again, it will be immediately resolved.  I RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THESE FOLKS OR IF YOU DO EMBARK ON THEIR SERVICES, DO NOT SET UP AUTO PAYMENT WITH THEM.  I don't want to cancel my credit card because one business entity can't get it right, but if it happens again, that's what I will have to do.  Booooo!
1;I don't think I saw an employee for the first 10 minutes I was in there. Once I basically ran into one he was helpful.
2;"Overall, 3.5 stars. While I adore the Mandarin Oriental, I expected more from MOzen Bistro. Don't get me wrong- nothing was in the slightest bit bad! But I just felt like for the money you pay here, there should have been more urgency for quality/above&beyond creativity. \n\nOkay, something that really threw me off: it's the Mandarin, so of course I'm going to get tea. I ordered the green, but asked if I could do this iced. They said sure, no problem. They bring me out a piping hot pot of green tea, and cup of ice. Well, I'm sure that you can imagine the combination. They could have done this much better (brewed it twice to triple as strong, poured it into excessive amounts of ice, then had a separate pitcher for me, etc). But, this was just the drink, so I won't judge them a ton on that. \n\nService was standard for the Mandarin. That in itself says enough. \n\nThe food took about an average time to arrive. I got the Eggs Migas (their southwestern approach to scrambled eggs). These were good, but I'm glad I ordered a side of goat cheese to scramble in...it gave it a nice extra kick. \nMy mom had the steel-cut oatmeal and expressed her delight with it. My dad had the omelette, and it was just a standard omelette...nothing special or out of the ordinary. \nSister and her boyfriend had the French toast on the baguette..and they said it was again \""just okay.\""\n\nThe real winner:\n--Yogurt, granola, & fruit parfait! PLEASE just get this. Housemade yogurt and granola and it was divine. Great, fresh fruit throughout.\n--Chicken-apple sausage! Just a tad sweet and big on taste. \n\nI prefer Thomas Keller's Bouchon over at the Venetian-- more selection, not as overpriced, and just overall better, in my opinion. If you're at the Mandarin Oriental, though, then this is your best (and only?) bet for a breakfast and/or early lunch."
1;You get what you pay for and the Riviera is no exception.  The Casino is definitely dated but doesn't feel as dingy as it could.  The rooms are comfortable and the pool is decent.  Worth leaving the property to find good food.  The walk to the strip is fairly quick too.
1;Was in town visiting a friend on a Sunday evening. We decided to make it easy and get some subs for dinner.  We tried 3 different ones, pastrami, steak and cheese and the turkey.  The each had a name but I can't remember\n\nI was very y disappointed with two of the three.  Especially the turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce one. I think they forgot to put the turkey on it.  Terrible. Steak and cheese a bread on bread  sandwich.  \n Pastrami was Okay.  I think what saved it was the coleslaw and I'm pretty sure I tasted some Swiss cheese.\n\nIf you don't have much of a choice I suppose the place is ok but maybe they can offer a little up charge for some extra meat.  Or weigh the ingredients  of the  sandwiches so you get the right balance.
2;While looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night after had just arrived from the airport, we ended up here.  How bad can it be? Its a burger joint.  I opted for a small burger, perfect size for me and cooked the way I wanted.  Service was fast which we were happy about since we were so hungry.  Not bad for a quick meal, fast and affordable.
0;So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!
3;Finally got to try the vegan donuts that all the vegans in the world are raving about!  \n\nOn this trip to Vegas, my bf and I flew so we didn't have cheap car transportation to the donut shop.  Took the cab from Aria hotel to the donut shop, jumped out to get some donuts before they closed at 4pm, and then jumped back into the taxi to go straight to the airport.  That whole cab ride cost us $35!  Those were some expensive donuts, but I'm so glad I finally got to try the donuts.\n\nNot that the donuts are out of this world or anything, but I had been meaning to try out those donuts for a very long time now.  Their donuts are just like any other classic donut shop.  Nothing creative like Doughnut Plant of NYC or Voodoo Donuts of Portland, OR.  But their vegan donuts are simple, and simple is good.\n\nI got a whole box to take home to my family in Southern California.  I got Boston Creme, glazed, maple bars, and their apple burrito fritter.  The shop owner was so nice, she threw in a whole dozen doughnut holes for free!  SCORE!\n\nOnly the glazed donuts really tasted soft and fluffy.  The boston creme was so good with all the oozing vegan custard.  The other donuts you could tell they were vegan because they weren't as fluffy and were a bit cakey, but not a dealbreaker.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the apple burrito, that was a bit dry to me.  Maybe my donuts would've tasted better if I didn't come at closing hour, but whatever.  When I went, there were no other customers in the store so it was perfect for my hit-and-run with the cab waiting outside!  Cab driver must've thought I was weird for wanting to go to a random donut shop in Chinatown that was out of the way from the airport!
0;"Not a frequent yelper but want to save others from my mistake. This meal was supposed to be the highlight of our Vegas trip- sadly, it was a low point. This would be zero stars but for our friendly waiter and the excellent wine pairings. \n\nAccording to other yelp users, a limo service is offered to take you to and from the restaurant. We were not offered this service and when I called to inquire I was treated as if I was making it up! There was something a little disappointing about dropping 2500 on dinner and having to walk 200 yards through a smoky casino to get to a cab. I also was disappointed that I wasn't offered a dark napkin (or at less a nonpilling one) and that I wasn't given a fresh napkin when I went to the restroom. Minus one star for service. \n\nDecor in the restaurant is odd. Purple and gold and \""opulence, I has it\"". Todd pointed out that the impressionistic art was in contrast to the period decor- I thought it was odd the hostesses were in Asian attire at a traditional french restaurant. Gaudy and odd I can live with, but it carried over to the table setting. There were fake candles and glitter covered\nStyrafoam balls on the table as decorations! And salt and pepper shakers. Can't believe food from the chef of the century would require seasoning. Minus one star for ambiance. \n\nOrdered the 16 course degustation menu. Bread cart,  12 plates and dessert cart. Not one memorable in a good way course. Plating was unattractive at best. There were inedible garnishes- costume jewelry and ribbons. And they taped down the bowls to the serving trays with scotch tape. And to top it off, the cheese cart is not included in the degustation menu! Minus two stars for food. \n\nKicker- up most of the night with stomach issues. If my phone call re: limo service was any indication, my call to inform the restaurant of this will not go well. \n\nOnly bright spot was the $595/person wine pairing. They opened several nice bottles for us to enjoy. They were knowledgeable and enjoyed talking about the wine. The pairings were good, not great, but the wine was so special it made up for it. If I had to go back (I never will) I'd ask for the wine pairing."
4;Picked lunch up for the office and everyone was impressed! Their big portions make it nice so that we can all share! We ordered Moo Shoo Pork, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Fried Rice, Crab Puffs, Egg Rolls and Won Ton Chips. We'll be ordering from China Wok again!  -Momentum Brokers
1;Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about.  The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys.  I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal.\n\nAgain, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one.
2;I want to give it 3.5 but that's not an option. I have wanted to eat here ever since I found out it was awarded 2 michelin stars. But reading the menu I had always been reluctant because there is a serious lack of creativity and it seems dated.  \n Turns out my preconceived perceptions were accurate. Eating here is like a culinary time warp back to 1985. With an ambiance that is very quiet and stuffy (not good when your in Vegas).\n We did the degustation menu (which based on reading previous reviews hasn't changed in a very long time). To recap Lobster Salad, Scallop, Foie Gras & either Turbot or Lamb (I chose the turbot) followed by choice of dessert. \n What the restaurant deserves credit for is service and execution. Although the dishes were rather boring conceptually in each case the protein was cooked perfectly. Maybe the best seared scallop I have ever been served. Thus the 3.5 rating. \n If you are dining with the elderly or are not an adventurous diner you'll probably be very happy. But, if your like me and prefer something lively, innovative and unique Picasso is not for you.
4;Since I was accustomed to HIIT training, I was really hesitant to try pure barre at first. 9 months later, leaner than ever, and addicted to the burn, I can't get enough of Pure Barre Chandler. The instructors are always welcoming and energetic. The music puts me in the zone hitting the right BPM for all the different segments. And last, but not least the variation of exercises works muscles I've never felt before.\n\nI highly recommend taking at least 10 classes to get acclimated with the moves and to really start feeling the difference. \n\nLiftToneBurn!
3;One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!
0;Not impressed with the service or the food, also we came because of a restaurant.com gift certificate and was informed that they weren't accepting them anymore, even though I had just purchased it today. Our waitress went to check on what could be done, when she returned about ten minutes later she explained that her manager had just left so she couldn't do anything except remove the charge for drinks. I ask what successful restaurant leaves themselves without a manager at 8pm on a Friday? We won't be returning, I suggest eating at any of the other food establishments in the area.
2;"It is and will always be that late night restaurant that is super fast, semi lively, and satisfying. This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \""F**cking Long\"" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.\n\nSince I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention. Real shit, they kind of flirt way too much. I know it's common elsewhere but sometimes.. I just want to eat my food and be treated equally! :\\"
2;I really like Pei Wei.  But you have to understand what it is.  It is a chain.  It is not quite fast food, but not quite a restaurant.  It is rarely great, but almost never bad.  It's consistent, like most chains are.\n\nThe crab wontons are tasty, and I love the sweet chili sauce that they come with.  \n\nMongolian Beef, Honey Seared Shrimp are a couple of our go-tos.\n\nThere are much better Chinese/Asian restaurants in the world.  There are also quite a few worse.  Like I said, it is consistent and reliable - and sometimes that's all I need.  I rarely crave Pei Wei specifically, but I would never turn it down.
1;I hate writing this update because I used to really love Apple Spice, but the last three times we have ordered lunch there have been multiple mistakes. For a place that does catering, getting 10 lunches right doesn't really seem like too much to ask.\n\nToday, two people ordered bread bowls. They received a very small container of soup with a slice of bread. That is not really a bread bowl.\n\nMe and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad, sans cheese. It came with chicken, and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken, so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for.\n\nOne of the lunches came as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and Heather W. was missing her cookie and her juice with her meal.\n\nApple Spice was nice enough to replace the mistaken items (brought corrected salads, brought the actual bread bowls - although, not with new soup, brought the wrap) and bring us an extra plate of cookies, but like I said, this is the third time this type of mistake has happened. \n\nIt's pretty expensive, the Southwestern is not even very good, and once the order comes back wrong it delays my eating for an hour + and it is just frustrating.\n\nI'm sorry Apple Spice... you guys are great but you need to get it together.
0;I am not a big fan of AMANDA (owner and waitress), or Fuego Del Mar A.K.A. Fuego Tacos! \nIf you are new in the area or just visiting, please watch out for this restaurant!! I assure you this place will give you suspicions.\nWhat's the point of having a groupon deal if the business does not welcome newcomers! Please please be careful yelpers.\n\n(Just needed to repost here)
1;I have mixed feelings about my experience at the duce. I took my mother, sister and girlfriend there on a Tuesday night and had a fun time overall. The positives are that the food is good, the building was large, and they had a unique list of beers: old style, schlitzz, and other Chicago-only beers.\n\nUnfortunately, the waitress that took our order was very rude, the bartenders were blatantly talking about how to get more tips out of their customers,  and the macaroni and cheese muffins were not as good as Guy Fieri made them out to be. \n\nI would not recommend this place because of the service, the limited parking, and the uncomfortable seating. I could not see myself coming back unless they improved their menu, and worked on their customer service.
0;"I was really, really looking forward to Sunday brunch at the Herb Box, as I have heard rave reviews! I have also walked past it many times on the waterfront, and have enjoyed the live music I've heard, as well the chic look of the place. I'm a definite foodie, and the menu looked great, so I was stoked to try it!  Well, I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an \""off\"" day or what, but our experience at the Herb Box today was terrible, from beginning to end. :-(\n\nMaybe it's all part of some restaurant \""rudeness\"" kitsch that I am unaware of, but I really hate to say that the service was pretty awful--the hostesses were snobby and unfriendly, and the wait staff was very inattentive. I accidentally spilled a glass of ice water on my lap as our server handed it to me, and he just left the table without a word, and without offering or bringing back any napkins. Lucky for us it was 90 degrees out and it all dried fast! :-) \n\nAnd then the food. Ugh. Really disappointing, especially for the price. I ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a Market BLT, based on Yelp recommendations.  The lassie was literally curdled and undrinkable, and the BLT had absolutely no bacon/pancetta on it. My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash, which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors, but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks. Awful, awful.\n\nI don't like to complain about food while sitting at a table, and I never send anything back. In this case, I really wish I had been able to, but we only saw our server twice--once when he took our order and again when he brought the check. He did not deliver our food and no one ever refilled our drinks. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there, so after 90 minutes of being basically ignored by the wait staff, we left with empty stomachs, out $50.00. Total waste, will probably never return. Bummer! :-("
1;It is rare for me to give two stars, and I was so disappointed with my food that I had to write a missive on it.  Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food - simple ingredients so not much you can do wrong.  Quite frankly, the worst tasting Chicken Shawarma I have ever tasted.  The chicken meat looked and tasted like it had come preboiled and prepackaged.  Flavorless, and not something I would expect from such an otherwise flavorful dish.  The shredded lettuce likely came from the same vendor McDonalds has, and I don't recall much else except the flavorless echo of a yogurt-based tzaziki.  Falafal is dried up and lack-luster, hummus is dressed up in Israeli fashion with Paprika - but otherwise uninspired.\n\nThis place is open late, every night of the week - and definitely caters to a younger un-discerning crowd that is inebriated and needing to fill their bellies with sustenance.  And the price is right at about $7-$8 for a meal with fries.\n\nCome here if you are trying to avoid a bad hangover, but not if you want quality middle eastern food.
2;The phone department is very knowledgeable. The geek squad department  is slow and doesnt have great  customer service. They give  you unrealistic time frames and have you  wait an extra 30 minutes while they chit chat between each other in the back
3;Even though this place is a good 20 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale, it's well worth it once you get there.  My wife and I dined there last year while in town for a wedding at the nearby Boulders resort (Excellent btw).  After one trip to Spotted Donkey, we were already planning our next trip back to Scottsdale just to go back.  Well, the golf and spa were other factors but I will travel for good food.  So our next trip was about a month ago and our two visits did not disappoint.\n\nBe sure to try the guacamole.  Although it's $10.50, it's really good.  HINT: order it without one of the ingredients like onions and they will make a fresh batch.  The second time we went, we forgot to order it without onions and it didn't taste as good.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin, which is served over a bed of mac and cheeese and green chiles.  It's delicious and large enough for two meals.  \n\nEven if you think it's too far to drive for dinner, the beautiful town of Carefree will give you that Arizona experience you know you want and get you away from the urban feel of Scottsdale.
3;This to me is a very efficient airport. I have never had major issues navigating this place and it offers slots, food and drinks in all the terminals. The security line has always moved quickly and finding flight information couldn't be easier.  The lady next to me at my gate was using free wi-fi and overall it is a clean airport. My only complaint is the taxi line can get very long when arriving and people with physical challenges end up walking quite a bit while carrying their luggage.
4;This could be the best restaurant in Charlotte. I have been three times now and each experience is unbelievable. The pasta dishes are all perfect and each should be ordered to share. The falafel is some of the best I have ever had. The steam bun is such a pleasant surprise. Each dish is so well thought out and the service is always great. Though I can't eat shellfish I've always been told that the scallops are to die for.
3;I ordered the California cheeseburger and it was good. Seasoned fries were delicious. My burger came with a slice of grilled pineapple and avocado slices... Good choice. Minus one star because the service was slow. The waitress was very nice but the restaurant was not busy at all and our good took long to come out.
4;Our dinner last night was outstanding!  From the fantastic celery leaf gimlets, grilled Hamachi collar, and tuna tartar we had at the bar - to the wonderful tasting menu we had in the beautiful dining room - everything was truly spot on!  Our waiter was Brian - what a gem.  Chef Stevens is a genius - that dinner was amazing.  Amanda, the manager came over to check on us as well.  It's one of our favorite places!
2;I like the place but am a little concerned.  Today, 9/19/14 I used my debit card.  I swiped normally on the customer counter and she asked if it was a debit.  I said yes and she took my card and swiped it on a machine next to her cash register and told me to enter my PIN.  I did but was bothered by the double swipe.  I had heard stories of personal machines used to steal debit card #'s and pins.  Hope I didn't screw up.
1;I made a reservation online for Sunday brunch, and our table of 6 was right in the sun on the Bliss side with zero shade. We asked to move and were fairly warned ahead of time that the ReBar side was a bit less attentive. We didn't care, we just needed shade! So we moved to the other side and despite the warning, it took an unnecessarily long amount of time to get drinks, food, silverware, and the check. The server appeared to be pretty taxed, but made apologies for the wait and running back and forth. Several of the orders came out incorrectly but we didn't want to made anything of it because it appeared as though he really was doing his best.\n\nWe were bummed because the dishes were pretty bland tasting and average looking. The Bloody Mary needed work. The sandwiches and salads charge quite a bit for extras like protein or french fries which is weird-- the only place I've seen that charges extra for fries is somewhere like ZinBurger that's known for quality, super tasty entrees. You can charge extra for protein on a salad if the base of the salad is really strong. At Bliss is just felt like an unnecessary up charge.\n\nOverall, the menu needs a little class. Someone with a good palette and eye needs to liven it up and make it more professional. I feel like most everything could have been made in my own kitchen.\n\nIt is in a great location, and the patio is beautiful and such a great environment, but I won't go back for more than drinks because it's just not worth the price.
0;Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff was nice, so I guess that's how they earned their star.
1;"I went there today for a foot massage. \n\nThe premises are clean and the young gal that gave me a foot massage did a soso job as she did not have the strength .. I have had many foot massages all over the world and on a scale of 1 to 10, her skills were maybe a 3. \n\nIt was $36 for 1 hour and when left I gave $40 total. Not the best tip, but considering that I did not get a heavy massage I felt it was okay. The receptionist had the nerve to tell me that it was minimum $10.00 tip for a one hour foot massage. Are you kidding me? Do you even know the meaning of \""tip\"". The service should be very good to get around 20%, let alone 30%! I gave them another dollar and left. I was planning on going back there the next couple of days, but I am done with this place.\n\nI should have read the similar reviews on Yelp before I went in. Oh, and that nonsense about getting tea from another reviewer - no tea was ever given to me."
2;This is the perfect Japanese restaurant to go to if you need something relatively quick and consistent.  My husband and I have been to the Kabuki franchise here as well as in Los Angeles multiple times...the staff is almost always friendly and the food good (but not great).  \n\nI love the spicy tuna on crispy rice and my husband loves the bbq beef ribs with shrimp and vegetable tempura.  Those are must haves!!\n\nWe will probably eat here once a month because its very close to our home and its a place we know we can rely on.  Kabuki is a steady eddie but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
3;My husband and I have been here quite a few times now.  We love the cream cheese wontons and pork gyoza.  The sushi is great and cheap, as well.  I was reluctant to try the sushi here, but I'm glad I did, as it's a good alternative when I can't get to a sushi bar or want a cheaper option.  My only complain is I wish they would deliver! :)
1;"This banking center is horrible! The staff are nice and pleasant, but the service quality definitely leaves something good to be desired. At the busiest part of the day, they decide to send all but one of their bank tellers on break. So you got one teller, for a line of 7 or more people. And then the hostess says \""thank you for spending you time\"" in their bank. This banks management really needs to get their heads out of their little office or where ever it is, and schedule their tellers to work around busy schedules."
3;Lots of choices on there menu. \nThe grilled veggie appetizer is very good. \nNice place with a different atmosphere than an ordinary restaurant. \nVery friendly staff. \nThey also make there own soda  , which is  tasty.
1;Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check...
2;"So I ventured here last Friday to see some screamy generic emo \""metal\"" band with my boyfriend. My night started with the checking of ID's and mockery of my age using huge, and seemingly permanent black  x's on my wrists. I'm used to having everything poked, prodded, and searched through but here as long as I paid, I was in. I could have taken a butcher knife inside of the venue and no one would have known. I'm not for invasion of privacy but I definitely want a little bit of security when surrounded by havock-causing stereotypes. The standing area was separated between 21+ and the less fortunate so I took my usual place next to the 16 year olds taking phone videos of the concert and texting their friends. \nThe show was okay. I'm honestly don't know anything about sound systems and such being someone who has enjoyed the acoustics of a garage show before. So there wasn't anything noticeably bad...but I wasn't particularly impressed with much either. \nAt the end of the show I started feeling really nauseated. It was super hot inside, the sweaty, shirtless were spinning and kicking in my direction, and my inability to LEAVE to get some air induced a feeling to throw up all over myself. Thankfully I didn't but I had to dive out at the last minute, not being able to bear the smell of greasy humans and what I deducted to be every one in the entire place to be taking a dump all at once. \nFunny enough, I was told later by my boyfriend that there were two staff members desperately trying to push back an overflowing toilet in the bar section. Well...that explains that. \nI DO like this place because it's dingy, small, and authentic. You feel like you're watching a show on a more personal level which makes a huge difference when watching a live performance. I also really appreciate the bands that they book. The all ages aspect and the super low prices for tickets also gives it some brownie points."
4;Love this place... If your looking for something new gotta try the bulgogi tacos, fusion lettuce wraps and all the burritos are killer good!! I definitely recommend this place highly!! You won't be disappointed!
1;The Groupon for the MJ Live show is a scam. The venue, Rio, stated that they do not have a contract with Groupon and that Groupon advertises what they want. \nWe purchase tickets for the show after calling to see if there was availability. Right after purchasing, we called back to make the reservation for the night and they said they cannot take Groupons. Of coarse, we were leaving the following day from Las Vegas, so we were not able to use the Groupons that we purchased. At the venue, they were selling tickets right up until showtime that night. There was plenty of time and after talking to a supervisor they stated that they cut off coupon tickets at a certain number but could not tell me with a certain number was. I stated that I made sure I had all my ducks in a row and had made sure there was availability, then called right back to book and was told they were full and could not take Groupons. \nI feel that this was definitely a scam and there is no intention of honoring them, as most people are in Vegas for a weekend. We still paid full price four tickets to the show because we had promised her daughter, and the show is decent.
3;We went for a quick drink and dinner.  Had a salad and my husband had the fish and chips.  Overall, the food was good, drinks were on special and the service was friendly.  Great atmosphere...lots of locals.
0;"There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
4;This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!
4;I have to say that we love looking at architecture design, so having learned about Taliesin West, we knew we had to check this place out while we were in the vicinity. Soooo glad we did, because this place is amazing! I could try and tell you about it, but like most architecture, you have to SEE it to understand and/or appreciate it. \n\nI can tell you that my favorite part of this place is the Sculpture Garden...so many amazing forms and figures upon which to gaze. Truly beautiful stuff!\n\nI have to admit that we lucked out, because as many folks have already pointed out, there is a fee to take the tour. However, because Hubby's uncle is a catering manager, he's overseen many catering events that have been held at Taliesin West. Because of that, our group of four was allowed in for free to follow him around pretty much every nook and cranny of the grounds. It was all very informational and educational and enthralling.\n\nThumbs up to the staff, who were all very nice and courteous and had no problem letting us go into areas that the tours did not visit...altogether, a great experience! :)
2;this store is inside the Hyatt so it's not as big as a regular place - a couple of times they have run out of certain bagels or fillings when there have been conventions or other group meets. the staff can be a tad slow but again, it all depends on the number of people... my bagel with lox and shmear is always good!!! and there are a couple of nice comfy chairs and a couch - if you can grab it
2;I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.
3;Shortly after my last review, the owner of R Salon reached out to me.  He was very apologetic about the service I received the first time around and acknowledged that the poor service was partly due in fault to the surprisingly high volume of living social vouchers that were sold.  He did speak with my nail technician regarding cell phone etiquette when servicing customers.  \nI was impressed with the fact that he reached out to me to begin with.  I could tell that he played a very vital and active role in his business.  I returned to R Salon several weeks later for a facial.  I saw Carol Kelly, an aethesician (sorry if I butchered the spelling) for 20+ years.  The service with Carol was stellar from beginning to end.  She was very engaged in learning everything about my skin (problems, areas of concerns) to even things in my lifestyle that would affect my skin (eating habits, vitamins, skincare routine).  I was very impressed by the length of time she spent to give me really great advice to help out with my issues.  On top of that, the facial itself was of course superb!  She meticulously extracted every little bugger and used a fabulous soothing mask after.  My skin was glowing from the time I walked out.\nAll in all,  I am very pleased that R Salon reached out and urged me to give them another try.  I will definitely be going back to Carol for another peel and/or facial.
1;"For those of you, who know the Valley, you probably have a good idea how far Goodyear is from Mesa  (for those of you not familiar, think San Francisco to Los Angeles ... LOL).  Nevertheless, we were prepared to run the gauntlet of rush hour traffic, crazy weekend drivers and take an overnight bag with us to try out this restaurant with spectacular reviews.  And once again, the Valley's populace has NOT let me down:  apparently, only ex-cons who suffered with prison food and people who've lost their sense of taste (both physical and mental) give 4 and 5 stars on Yelp to ANYTHING.\n\nFirst, let me say, that this restaurant's employees couldn't do more to make your dining experience a pleasant one:  they're friendly, very attentive and respond quickly to any request you could throw at them.  \n\nI haven't seen many Indian restaurants, which serve buffets at night, so I was curious to see how this place stacked up against other Indian places I've been to.  The decor is ... interesting.  From the ground level to about 7 feet up, the decor is homey and reminds you of Cheers-gone-Diner.  Above 7 feet, the decor can best be described as \""condemned factory\"".  But okay ... while decor is important in enjoying your meal, it's not necessarily a deal breaker ... if the food makes up for it.  Sadly, this is not the case.  While I give the restaurant overall two stars, I would specifically rate the food as  \""two-flushes\""  (figure it out, if you dare!).  I'm sorry, but this just happens to be one of those places that support my argument against low-flow toilets.  It's not that the food looks unappetizing; it's just that, well, it IS:  oversalted food; dry tandoori chicken; thin-sauce chicken tikki masala (and that was the BEST dish).  The na'an was okay ... actually, I liked it because it's thick; my other half likes the na'an thin and crispy.  Funny enough, the place was absolutely packed  (no doubt only with people who could prove they usually give at least 4 stars on their Yelp reviews).  \n\nI really wanted to give this place a stellar review, not the least, because its employees are top notch.  Unfortunately, when you come home to go to the bathroom after dinner and your dog runs away yelping with his tail between his legs, there's not much else to say.\n\nTruly sorry, guys."
3;Took the family last night and there was a 20 min wait.  Waiter gave us the specials for the night and provided good service.  The portions are very large so go hungry. The onion straws were tasty and so are the sweet potato fries.  Extensive list of beers.  Prices are reasonable.  It is consistently voted one of the best in Charlotte.
4;I miss this place.  Lots of live plants inside, and food that brought me right back home.
4;The Cheesecake Factory owns this cafe.  The food is always good and the prices are what you would expect.  They are open 24/7.  The wait staff is nice.
4;"My favorite place to eat when I'm staying downtown.  I very rarely go for traditional dinner in Vegas, so trips to The Chart House, Vic & Anthony's or Hugo's Cellar kind of go out the window.  Aside from that, I just don't want to spend a fortune on a meal when I'm going to spend the balance of my evening gambling, drinking, and wandering around Fremont St.  \n\nI usually wander over to the Triple 7 between 12 AM to 3 AM, and no matter what I've ordered, I've never had a bad meal there.  That's telling for me, because usually a place will have a few duds, and you just have to learn what not to order.  Trust me when I say the Triple 7 always delivers good food.  I read other reviews refer to this place as a gem, and they are correct.  It's what you want when you look to a meal you can enjoy at any hour.\n\nSome of my \""Must Try\"" recommendations are the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, Triple 7 Wings (when you're taking down a few of their Triple 7 Brews), Monterey Chicken Sandwich, Fish & Chips, or my drunken go to: Baked Italian Sub.  \n\nLook, I could go on and on, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're downtown, this is by far the best place to eat at. Give it a shot...."
0;The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go.
0;Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here!  The food at this place is absolutely disgusting!  The soup was so salty and tasted like muddy water.  The rib appetizer wasn't even edible!  It was like it had been made a week earlier.  The foil wrap chicken app was some mysterious pieces of chicken stuffed in foil with salt!  Disgusting!  The sweet & sour pork was seriously like chewing on shoe leather! It had no flavor whatsoever....like it had been boiled to death.  The lo-mein wasn't any better.  It was so salty that you couldn't even eat it!  I hadn't been to this place for about 10 years, due to the last experience I had here.  Made a huge mistake thinking it got better after 10 years.  Not even a little bit better!  Save your money!  Panda Express blows this place away!  And I'm not a big fan of that place either....but at least the food is fresh!  I don't know how China Inn even keeps it's doors open!  Very strange cause there is rarely cars there...hmmm.
0;"Definition of a roach motel with cockroaches working behind the front desk. I say its a waste of money remodeling \""the quad\"" \""the linq\"", \""imperial palace\"", whatever Ceasers is calling it now-a-days. I say save the money and level it. This place is disgusting and stinks! Worse than the worst motel 6 on the planet! Employees are such jerks too."
2;"Is it possible (or relevant) to review potential? I get the impression that like much of central Phoenix, this hotel is in a state of long-term renovation. When it's finished, things could/will be pretty nice.\n\nFirst impressions-- a sign visible from the street would be nice. The hotel is located on a poorly lit side street with a temporary banner/sign that you cannot see until you get to the hotel driveway. If you are arriving at night and need a landmark, just look for the adult bookstore sign and turn into the street that looks more like the alleyway behind the bookstore.\n\nThe parking structure is oddly arranged; the closest parking is chained off and the remaining spaces leave you with a wierd vibe, like \""...do I really want to risk leaving my vehicle here overnight?\"" \n\nMy room was nice and spacious, and it had the sleep number bed that Juan L. mentioned in his review. Free high speed internet was a nice touch. Housekeeping must have been messing with me, taunting my OCD vulnerabilities-- 1 complimentary bottle of water, 1 face towel, 2 hand towels, and 3 bath towels. WTF??\n\nThe pools looked nice, with the faux boulder treatment, but strong chlorine smell kept me away. The gym looked decent, but was always closed by the time I got back to the hotel each day.\n\nThe potential part:\nFEZ is just a short walk to Central Avenue if you cut across the parking lot of the high rise office tower in front of the hotel. Right now, it seems a bit sketchy at night but worth the risk for some decent food. I expect this will be a bit better in the future.\n\nThe light rail (when finished) will open up access to a lot of the area. Right now, FEZ, Durant's, and Honey Bear bbq are among place I visited within walking distance, as is the Heard Museum and the Phoenix Public Library.\n\nI would visit again to see if the hotel (and the area) grows into its potential."
1;Unless I'm going with bottle service with the modelesque bottle girls, this is not the nightclub to be at as a regular patron. Small dance floors that are some of the smallest among the nightclubs on the strip. Sure, the place has 4-5 floors with two of em closed off (one because of $10K bottle service tables). All in all, it is a shade above most of the nightclubs, only because of the DJs that regulate here.
2;"This isn't your Grandpa's Flamingo anymore. I would even venture to say this isn't your overweight Chain smoking uncle Larry's Flamingo we all knew and didn't love from 5-10 years ago!\n\nBefore My recent trip to The Flamingo, the thought of staying there would immediately trigger thoughts of Depressing 1980's decor, overweight fanny pack wearing gamblers & The over exuberant expressions of Donnie & Marie as they stared longingly into each others eyes trying to forget about that one night back in 77' when things went a little to far. But to the contrary I must say the Flamingo has really cleaned up its act. The new decor is nice and the casino floor is clean and 80% fanny pack clear. \n\nNow saying that I have yet to stay in a room, but I will say that , where as before I would've only taken a side chick I was slightly ashamed of. Now I would be ok with taking a side chick I was not ashamed of, as well as possibly a girl that I have been dating awhile, all the while  insisting \""Why do we have to put labels on what we are\"" here without hesitation!\n\nAll in all The Flamingo is an OK place with a GREAT location that I would recommend anyone walking the strip to try out. Hey, who knows you may finally be the first person to see Donnie and Marie finally consummate 35 years of tension and frustration!"
3;Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.
4;"Located in the Wynn hotel (my favorite!)\n\nWe were lucky enough to score awesome tickets to Le Reve through the discount tickets counter.  The theatre is great, and there is not a bad seat in the house.  The first two rows are \""splash\"" rows, so they tend to be a little cheaper.  We sat a row behind the splash rows, and I only felt a little bit of splash.  \n\nThe best part of the show, the amazing dives!  Since the show was a water show, I was so amazed at their ability to hold on to each other without slipping! \n\nTruly an amazing show.  If you like Cirque to Soleil, you will like Le Reve."
4;We have been My Gym members at the District for over 4 years and Jeremy is the best!  He works really hard at keeping the kids engaged and active.  Every week the class is different and exciting.  Both of my kids LOVE this place and I feel it has helped them develop very important life skills, both mentally and physically.  The environment is clean, bright and fun.  (great music)  Some people believe it's pricey, but I don't think anything in town compares to the value received.  I've tried many different clubs/classes/sports and My Gym is consistently better for the quality of instruction & fun.  My boys never nap and they leave My Gym tired. Bonus!
2;Website pricing is cheaper than what you will get charged at this location. Attendant and cashier both agreed, but just shrugged it off. As for the actual wash, they do good job.
4;Oh, I'm coming back to this place!  My first experience with a noodle house.  The ramen was so yummy, not like the ramen noodles I had as a kid.  Now I wonder how I ever stomached that stuff. I guess when you're a college kid you eat anything.  \n\nLet's get back to Monta Chaya.  I let the waitress know is was my first time in such a place.  At this she thanked me for coming and made sure I enjoyed my experience.  I was torn between the salad and the bun appetizer.  I mentioned his to my waitress and she said she could give me just one bun so I could try everything I wanted.  For my main dish, I ordered the tonkotsu with the garlic oil and added nitamago. Oh it was delicious.  I do have to say that both the garlic oil and the nitamago both added a rich creaminess to the soup, maybe a little to much, but you've got to indulge every so often.  The noodles were silky smooth, not your dehydrated ramen.
3;If you want sushi at your own pace and without telling the sushi chef what you want, then this place is it.  The quality I would say borders good to excellent. This is rather surprising in the fact that this is a conveyor belt styled sushi place. The price is very reasonable.\n\nThe staff cycles the dish frequently to keep the items fresh and cold. For a sushi connoisseur, there is nothing worse than warm or luke-cold sushi.\n\nSelections are average in that, there are more rolled sushi as opposed to nigiri styled sushi.\n\nI do hope the staff will provide ginger (gari), along with wassabi to all the patrons. \n\nFinally, this is not a restaurant to hold your power meetings, but will accommodate groups, family style dining, in casual setting.
0;"I thought about writing this review for a while now, I rarely write negative reviews, but I honestly cannot refer this place to anyone\n.\nWent to Times Square for a friend's birthday celebration, it was on a Sunday at 12:30pm she had a nice turn out of maybe 17 people.  Our server was Teresa; she was extremely rude and somewhat combative.   I arrived around 12:45 so it was 15 minutes to one, after checking out the menu the only thing I looked forward to having was the cheese steak sandwich with peppers & onions, I told Teresa that I would like that, and she said no you can't, it's not 1pm yet (it was 12:50 at this point) and that I would need to order something now, I told her I don't know what I want , she said ill wait here till you tell me so I can get these orders in.  I felt rushed into something I didn't want and didn't understand why she couldn't take orders from the rest of the table and come back around after 1 (by now it was less than 9 minutes away) She then proceeded to tell me that it wouldn't even be possible to order it at 1pm because they (the cooks) need to clean the grills and everything so there would be no cross contamination. Said something having to cook the peppers and onions and that wouldn't be done until after 1.  I was not happy.  I told her I was not ready to order yet. \n\nI really hate having a craving for something to find out you can't but scanned the menu and ordered the Mediterranean salad, mixed greens, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, pepperoncini, olives, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, red onions & feta cheese.  Sounds good right? Nope, it wasn't, everything was soggy wet, I didn't need to put any dressing on it, the artichoke hearts & roasted red peppers tasted as if they came out of the can/jar wasn't even rinsed or dried off, the feta was soggy, the entire salad was just miserable.\n\nAfter rude service and horrible food I just wanted to get the heck out of dodge, I asked for my check, I had the cash out ready for when she brought it to me, I gave it right back to her, she then placed in on the table, walked away for about 10 minutes came back handed everyone else there checks, ran all of the credit cards gave them back there checks, they signed their cards in left, I was the 1st to request and to pay but had to wait for 15 other people's  credit cards to come through before she even went to get change for me.  \n\nI didn't complain to the manager because it was my friend's birthday, but I will never set foot back in that place, just soo rude.  Save your time and money and find somewhere else to eat."
3;Nous y \u00e9tions pour la game de hockey.\nOn est arriv\u00e9 vers 18h, toutes les tables \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es mais ils se sont d\u00e9brouill\u00e9s pour nous en faire une (on \u00e9tait 5, pas \u00e9vident) et on \u00e9tait m\u00eame bien plac\u00e9s, face \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran et proche de cette grande fen\u00eatre qui donne sur la rue et qu'ils avaient ouvert. Tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able !\nUne bonne ambiance (malgr\u00e9 le score final), les sauces des ailes de poulet sont top, et les burgers \u00e9taient vraiment bons ! Je reviendrai pour tester celui au bison : il titille mes papilles ! :)
0;I ordered a green tea smoothie. A large. I was watching the guy make my drink and the smoothie was not even close to the top. He tried playing it off by shaking my drink afterwards so it can seem like it's full. I could've just paid for a small drink for the amount he gave me. I always come back here to give it a shot but ehhh. It's the same experience.
2;"We went here after the awesome Yelp Spring Fling, and had a sampling of a number of menu items. The \""ambience\"", if one can use that term here, was part taco joint, part Mexican food store, and part Mexico City bus station replete with a tv showing telenovelas. We were dying for tequila or at least a nice cerveza, but alas, no liquor licence. However, they do have some \""drink if you dare\"" Mexican sodas, which contain twice the legal limit of sugar and food coloring of normal soda (which I generally don't drink anyway, unless it's mixed with something). Don't expect too much in any regard here. They do tacos, fairly well, and that's what I'd recommend ordering here, although something possessed me to order the tamales too (more on that in a sec). We started off with guacamole. Having lived a good 10 years in Texas, and traveled a lot to Mexico for work, it was, well, really odd. They mix iceberg lettuce and tomato in with the avocado, and there's nary a hint of garlic or lime. The result is a bit gloopy and fairly unpleasant, especially if you're expecting a beautifully dense unctuous avocado forward, garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro based dip. Oh well. The tortilla chips though, which seemed homemade, were light and crisp, and we even bought a bag to take home. The salsas were equally good, with the tomato based one being the standout. The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas. The tamales though were pretty bad. I am a big tamale fan. These were mealy and dry, and the filling was cloyingly sweet and unpleasant. This place does tacos, and they do them pretty well. I'd come back for the tacos al pastor and chips and salsa, and the telenovelas of course. Hasta pronto."
1;"While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \""forgot\"" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \""harried\"" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \""encounter\"".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes. \nThe Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.  Coffee arrived bitter, luke warm, and no refills were offered. \nIn closing, Id skip Golden Steer. There are wayyyyy too many fine steak house in Vegas to be bothered with this dinosaur."
3;Bons burgers. Salle sympa.
0;"What a joke! Sysco food at $20 a plate, wait staff that are trained to be corporate jukeboxes, and greasy managers trying to get the last penny out of your pocket. We are not the complaining type and have kids who wait tables, but after there was a small mistake our meal was interrupted not once, but five different times by a short Asian manager who should have been working in a call center, not a restaurant. It was the most annoying thing I have even been forced to be a part of, him trying to degrade the server as much as possible, and then for the icing on the cake he brought out a desert for \""free\"" which I accepted. This is a standard practice, but when the waiter came with the bill it had the desert on it and I kid you not, $1 taken off a rather large bill. I didn't even say anything, this was too much and I didn't want to see the manager for a sixth time, he would have told me it was the waiters fault. I don't want to be interrupted five times in my meal by a manager asking me repetitively in an indirect way for reasons the server messed up, when it was really him messing up my meal. The original mistake was minimal, and it was this call center attitude that really pissed me off, enough to come on here and rant. I don't think a comment card justifies my experience there, and I should warn others about this place. Go to one of their neighbors, at least you know that your getting chain restaurant food, but wont have to deal with the garbage at this place. I have had better food and service at a buffet. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!"
0;NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party.  We couldn't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar.  So we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30.  We were told that they already had last call and they were'nt making any more drinks!  Seriously, it's New Year's Eve! Plus the staff was rude and ignored people and talked to people they knew.  Really bad customer service especially if you wanted to impress guests and keep they're interest.  Blue Hound, you didn't succeed.  Hope you try better in the future.
3;"We stayed for  free for a 3 day weekend and pretty much stayed in the hotel experiencing everything it had to offer. Rather than try to capture the whole hotel in a line, I'll try to break it out:\n\nRooms (4): As many have said, it's just a Venetian room in brown color tones. I'm kind of jaded as I've stayed in many 4/5 star rooms in Vegas (mandalay, venetian, caesars,etc) so I didn't find that this one was all that exciting or spectacular. It was however very nice and on par with a 5 star hotel.\n\nRestaurants/Shopping (5): Incredible, tons of great restaurants and lots of great shopping. Shops are open until 11! however, not any good casual options.\n\nPool (3): Ok so as a word of warning.. the pool at palazzo doesn't get sun until 1 PM!!! Ok so you're thinking you might be sleeping till 1 Pm anyways, but good luck getting a chair at that point without paying the pool guys a fat tip. Also, no food served pool side! You have to get up and get your food (I'm a prima donna, I know) and the food isn't that good and WAY overpriced. Also drink service was lacking.. I should have moved over to the Venetian side I guess?\n\nNightlife Gaming (3): High limits ($15) for craps.. no surprise there. Lavo was just ok, but I'd like to explore the jazz bar next time. 40/40 sucks. I did however enjoy the happy hour at the cheesy \""del toro\"" in the basement. $6 drinks ,  I guess that's cheap? At least it had a nice strip view. Oh the sportsbook sucks too.. it's just a window near 40/40. boo\n\nEase of navigation (5): So this is important to me in Vegas.  I hate walking 30 minutes to my room, or having trouble finding craps,  restaurants, etc. This place is EASY. 1 tower of elevators, everything is well situated. Pool right off the elevators. That aspect is very nice.\n\nOverall a great place to stay, but with so many other great places to stay in Vegas I'd save this one for when you get a great offer in the mail. I would especially recommend this place for foodies due to all the yummy restaurants and how easy it is to pass out in your room after a nice meal !"
2;Had dinner with a large group. We had a superb wine, but I'm sure it was not cheap and was chosen by the host of the dinner. The food? Well...the chopped salad was pretty mediocre, and too filling with all the red kidney beans it it. The table breads and muffins were too dry, kind of inedible.\n\nDuck pancake...like someone had poured half a bottle of cheap, sweet syrup on it so who knows what the duck tasted like.\n\nThe porterhouse lamb chops - very good. This was by far the best thing I had. The lamb was perfectly grilled, and the sauce was inoffensive so you could enjoy the meat. \n\nDessert - that warm, pudding-like cake that I can't remember. It was good, and chocolate. Like many restaurants they served the dessert and then came around asking for coffee as kind of an afterthought. The coffee service took so long that it was tough to wait on eating the cake. Dang, I like coffee WITH dessert. But, most restaurants haven't figured out how to serve both at around the same time.\n\nThe restaurant is a nice spot in Caesars so I don't want to dissuade people from going. But, I'd make the grilled meat the centerpiece of what you order and not get too high on hope for the rest, based on what I experienced. And get a nice bottle of wine to go with it!
0;Here is my gripe. The food is good. No complaints there. It's the employees. While standing at the register and ordering, there were three girls behind the counter that kept staring at my wife, whispering, and rolling their eyes. They were literally looking her up and down. I had sunglasses on so they could not see that I was watching them, and actually my wife didn't notice it because she was busy ordering for our kids. After we went and sat down, I continued to watch them, and from a distance I not only observed the girls gawking at various femaie customers, but two of the male employees were also gawking at various girls and nudging and elbowing each other and staring. I have noticed this going at a two other restaurants, Rubios just up the street, and Port O Subs at Desert Ridge. And it's not like I'm looking for this, I just have a habit of noticing details in my surroundings. I would like to know if I am the only person in the world that notices things like this, because this behavior seems to be very common and management knows nothing (or does nothing) about it.
4;Staff is knowledgable and friendly. They have a big space, and hold lots of comic related event, but also gaming events for RPG's and CCG's. I visited all the comic shops when I moved here from NYC looking for a new on to feed my comic addiction, and Samurai is the one that I choose as the most real.
1;Went for breakfast and wasn't impressed at all.  The people who work at DeLucas are not friendly and have a you should be happy I am serving you attitude.  If you are not a morning person then you shouldn't serve breakfast.  A smile and a good morning goes a long way.\n\nThe food was mediocre, greasy and lacking flavor. I ordered the California Omelette and it was something I could make at home with better flavor.  The chicken in the omelette had no taste and it was overlooked.\n\nOverall, I don't get the hype.  This is similar to a greasy diner.  Pamela's is the place for breakfast.
4;Order the GFY burger.  You can thank me later.\n\nThis place is off the charts awesome.
3;Came here for lunch and, based on the recommendations of other reviewers, ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  It did not disappoint!  Croissant was moist and flaky, and chicken salad had a fresh, light flavor.  And I loved that the sandwich came with a a mini cupcake.
2;Wifi doesn't work in many of the public areas!  You'd expect them to get it right.
4;I absolutely loved my food here. It has been a long time since a restaurant really impressed me with their food, and khyber pass really is one of the gems in that list. I went in with really a complete blah mood, up for really anything. We were seated in the terrase. The servers were extremely fast, professional, and friendly. Their atmosphere is pretty good too. I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away. I had the table d'hote, which consisted of lentil soup and lamb korma, with the rose water rice pudding. Loved the soup and the korma not so much of the dessert as I dont like rose water flavor in general. The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. \n\nOh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.\n\nAnyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it. Overall I will definitely be more open to trying Afghan cuisine from now on. Thanks K P :)
2;"I've been to True Food a bunch of times but I still can't make up my mind as to how much I like it.  The food is consistently good, kale salad is awesome, tacos, pizza, soup are all good and I love that they have interesting drink choices - I tried the sparkling iced tea the last time and it was great.  Service can be spotty, I even had one waiter sell me on a vegan sweet potato soup only to take a bite and find it had chicken - not good, not good at all, that's a big mistake - they were completely unapologetic about it and blamed the kitchen staff for the mix up.  \n\nMy main gripe with this place is flies, yes flies.  Every time I've been here there are flies in the restaurant.  The last time I was here my husband looked at me and said, \""oh right that's why we don't come here more often, I forgot about the flies\"".  All things considered, it's just OK."
0;Leaving work and noticed that my tire was flat with an arrowhead shaped piece of metal between the tread. Pulled it out and used the fix-a-flat since I don't have a spare. Pressure held after I aired it up and drove home. Next day removed the tire and took it to Mcfall's, I showed them where I removed the shard and you could see where the goop had come out when I inflated the tire. They said nothing was wrong with the tire and there was no puncture, maybe somebody let out the air! Took the tire to Discount Tire where they found the leak (right where I told them it would be) and patched it.
1;"I recently stopped by the Luxor to watch the Jabbawockeez show. It's the one pyramid hotel with the light shooting up. It's the south part of the strip next to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. There is a free tram to get to the 3 different hotels since the 3 hotels are all part of the same branch. There's a huge sphinx you can take a picture of when you're waiting for the tram. \n\nThe casino is pretty old and you can tell it is old. There are a lot of workers who approach you for \""free tickets.\""  We asked a worker to direct us to the box office and he did, then started to persuade us for who knows what. I think it's some time share or presentation. Regardless, we got approaches by them ALL over the casino. It got really annoying. \n\nGames were average. It's all personal preference. I won't be staying here anytime, probably ever.  It's far from the other hotels and casinos I do like."
1;Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.
3;I love yard house.. Im not a super beer drinker but they have such a wide variety I can always find something that pleases the palate. I never seem to make it for happy hour so the bill can get kind of pricey but overall its a nice place to chill, drink, and get some noms. \nThe biggest draw back to hanging out there is its always LOUD. I don't think i've ever been there and had a normal toned conversation with my guest. The music is usually loud which means the patrons have to be louder just to be heard. It can get almost obnoxious at times. \nThat's the only reason why they get a 4 star review. Otherwise great place.
3;We tried it and liked it.  I thought it was better than most!  Traditional Mexican food and plenty of seafood options - or at least more than most.  It's always crowded and was recommended to us by an Arrowhead resident.
2;Stopped by here to get some early dim-sum. This place opened earlier than any other dim sum place in Vegas at 10:00am. All other places opened at 11am.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum was okay. For some reason, their har gow was small in comparison to what Im used to. The flavors were not bad. Prices were reasonable considering it was inside a casino, albeit the kinda run down Rio Casino.\n\nI think I'll wait until 11am next time I'm hankerin for dim sum in Vegas....
4;Hoyt kajukenbo has proven to be a great experience for my son. Sifu Greg is patient, alert, knowledgeable, and very realistic with expectations from all age groups. Shing Kim also demonstrates amazing patience and understanding as well as a wealth of knowledge.  This school teaches discipline and morals, and traditional values.  I am proud to know and to be associated with Hoyt kajukenbo.
3;I was so happy that they had Brazilian in Las Vegas. I was first introduced to this down south in San Diego. To my delight, this was not just another run of the mill Las Vegas buffet, or fast food hangover joint. High quality meats served piping hot right off the sword. Salad bar offered some good things, but I am a carnivore, so keep it comin! When I need some good food in Vegas, I make it a point to stop here.
0;"When I signed my lease they told me they recommend having the apt. sprayed for pests EVERY MONTH. The manger admits they have a roach problem and the pest control man told me as soon as it warms up the \""water bugs\"" meaning big roaches will show up. There is a pigeon infestation that is so bad when the wind comes up, there are feathers flying all over outside - it looks like you are inside a room full of birds. They poop on my stairs, entry way, live on my roof, near my air conditioning unit, feathers come in from the dryer vent. The pigeons sit in the dumpsters so when you put a bag of garbage in the dumpster, they fly up and get agressive and dustr and mites go all over the place. I get bit from bird mites when I go to get my mail. Have to wear long pants, socks and shoes to not get bit. My kitchen sink drains out in front of my apartment out into the parking area so there is always a stream of water there. I can see soap suds under the front of my building. Kitchen is a mess. Dishwasher opens across the two sinks, try putting dishes in when you have to move away from the sink, the refig is old and lopsided so the door won't stay open. Cupbards are so small I have to turn my dishes sideways to get them in. No linen closet, stacked washer & dryer with NO place to put laundry stuff. I contacted the manger because I have a bug infestation, which I showed the bugs to the police and they told me to contact the management and have pest control come out and find out what they are. Manager will not respond, I made second request in person in the office, still no response, now the management doesn't speak to me. My guess is several people got bird mites from the pigeon infestation so they are ignoring finding out if the bugs are bird mites. I lost my clothing and belongings due to it, am moving in 11 more days. Yes the view of the golf course is pretty, but the old men in the golf carts go right up to your bedroom and livingroom windows. You have NO privacy at all.I can hear my neighbors do laundry, shower. I fell sorry for the lady below me because I have to do so much laundry due to the bug infestation."
3;Disregarding the long line and expensive drinks - because well its vegas where most lines are long and most drinks are expensive - Tao is really incredible. I thought it was a little weird that there were so many suits running around with ear radios talking to each other. It made it feel a little chaotic.But I'm from Portland - that doesn't happen here. On any level.\nIts straight up huge - different bars, different themes, different decor, different girls dancing around in different matching outfits. It was crazy. \nThe atmosphere was very sexy, dark and smooth. I think all the Tao girls lounging around in beds, bathtubs, vip tables and dance floors helped that!\nThe music was great, but it was a little hard to get on the main dancefloor. \nLike the rest of Vegas, it pretty smoky in there. I wouldn't say any worse than any other club though. \nTao is amazing!!
2;Great ambiance for a Asian fusion restaurant, but where are my Asian peeps at???  The hostess-white, our waiter-black, our busboy-Mexican, but on my way to the restroom I finally find them.... The two cooks were Chinese.  The group of us were all from Asian decent and we asked our waiter to recommend some dishes.  When he mentioned kung pao and chop suey, I also busted out laughing.  The food was decent and their idea of brown rice is white rice tossed in soy sauce.  Oh yeah, you had to request chop sticks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm glad I live in the Bay Area.  If you want to try this place, get the Vietnamese beef cubes, the Korean seared steak, the deep fried whole flounder and the fried spinach that tasted like chips.
0;"Looks like I'm going along with the crowd on this one. Ate at the Frank Lloyd Wright location yesterday, and that will be the last time they see my smiling face walk through their doors.\n\nThe service was awful, and started when the waitress who sat us gave us the \""Oh lord, you have a CHILD???\"" She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before!\n\nThe food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying.\n\nThe salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely.\n\nWhen you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!!\n\nI've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper. Soggy...bland....tiny....nothing redeeming whatsoever.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back to Pizza Peeweecazzo. Ugh."
3;"First, let's get this clear: Los Dos is *not* a \""Mexican\"" restaurant.  It is \""New Mexican.\""  So if you're expecting whatever your idea of Mexican food is, you'll be confused and disappointed.  No soft tacos, no fish tacos, no big piles of tomato and lettuce with a side of sour cream.  Even the chips and salsa are different--the chips are thicker and crunchier, and the salsa is thin.  And there is no *mild* salsa.  \n\nI do not recommend this place for vegetarians,  nor is it for folks who don't like spicy food.  I also do not recommend their margaritas, unless you're okay with paying 10 bucks for a weak, too-sweet drink--to be fair, I like my margaritas the real, old-school way: tequila, triple sec, lime juice.  That's it.   But beer lovers should find something they'll like.\n\nIf you're smart, you'll steer clear of the pedestrian fare on the a la cart and combo menus and order from the \""chef's specials\"" section.  I highly recommend the chile relleno with adovada and the chile plate with machaca.  Of course, you can customize several of the dishes by selecting whichever meat you want--chicken, adovada, machaca, etc. The only non-spicy option here is the carnitas, which I never order because I love the adovada too much to pass up on it.\n\nThe plates come with beans (very good) and rice (okay), and the servings are huge. The tortillas served on the side are thick, chewy and the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the spicy, gooey goodness on your plate.  I always end up needing a to-go box, which I invariably send home with my partner--one \""cheat\"" a week is plenty, thanks!\n\nThe servers have always been friendly on my visits.  Last night, we had a very sweet young man who was as attentive as we would want.  The kitchen and the bar can be slow, though.  So don't expect to get in and out quickly.  The only thing that I totally disapprove of is the way the bill is sometimes presented.  Depending on how busy they are, sometimes the waiter brings you an iPad sort of device, and then stands there while you sign your bill.  I don't have an issue with going digital.  My problem is that the screen basically demands that you select from one of three pre-set tip amounts--I think it's 18, 20 and 22%.  I find that incredibly tacky, presumptuous and very awkward, since the server is standing there, waiting for you to finish with the device. \n\nSo I hope that the owners of this location are listening: Some of your guests may not know how to calculate a tip, but please don't insult those of us who do.  Do not impose upon our judgement of the service.  If you're *really* worried about your servers being screwed over by angry/cheap customers, make sure your employees do their jobs well, and/or pay them better.  Thanks."
3;"Okay, I really like this place! It is about a mile away from my house, friendly service, and the food is great. Their happy hour can't be beat!\n\nMy only gripe: I called in a take-out order last night and was told that orders were taking longer than usual and it would be a half hour. \""No problem!\"" I said. I showed up almost exactly 30 minutes later, and I waited for at least another 20-30 minutes in the restaurant. I totally understand that it's a Friday night and things are busier than usual, but if that's the case week after week, plan for it! Hire a few more sushi chefs on the weekends to not keep so many people waiting. There were 4 other customers waiting for their to-go orders along with me. It was a bummer!\n\nDespite the long wait, I will go back (but dine in)."
3;Who knew it covered 122 acres?! Huge park with lots to do for any outdoor activity. There's a lake as well and some drainage system or something, but I like to think it's a submarine top. \n\nGreat looking basketball courts! They have tennis courts across Park Road. The children's play area looks good too. I'm sure they have some great softball games on their 4 fields. I was seriously impressed with all the different areas (you can tell from the road that all of this exists!)!!\n\nThe one thing that I think others have mentioned, is the upkeep. Perhaps due to funding, it could have more maintenance. \n\nAlso, there is a recycling drop off in one of the corners off of the softball fields. Cool.\n\nYelp has this location in Ballyntyne, but it's in the South Park area on Park Road, just south of Tyvola/Fairview.
2;How I have not written a review for the Palazzo as many times as I have stayed here I don't know. I guess what happens in Vegas really stays in Vegas! Anyway, it is a great hotel, great location, the rooms are a good size and split between a sleeping and living room type areas. What I can't stand and why I don't stay here anymore is the bathroom lighting. It is so dim and so bad you can't do your makeup at all. It totally sucks.
1;Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts.
1;"Well I wouldn't really call this place a \""cocktail lounge\"" like sayyyy Side Bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. Even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. I am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! I'm not sure but this place KIND of reminds me of River City Pockets with less pool tables?? If this was like the only option available I'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice. I'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep."
2;"Had reservations on a Saturday night (10/11/14) with my wife and her parents. Wanted to sit outside but settled for inside as there was no open outside seating until after 9pm. Good ambiance and a nice setting with the fountains faintly visible in the background.\n\nFood: Menu had many options that looked great and we all ordered something different. Unfortunately, the food was so average to below average that it led me to write a review . The ladies each ordered a flat bread  (Prosciutto and Fig & Spicy Chicken Sausage). They were fine but nothing memorable. Below average dough with some fancy toppings. Father-in-law ordered the special, Braised Short Ribs. It had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Lastly, I ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. It was $34. It was an Olive Garden dish that had a bout 4 or 5 mushrooms in it. It even had the \""Signature Dish\"" stamp next to it; it was a disappointing signature dish. I'm rarely a harsh critic when it comes to food but the price we paid and the meal we got was disappointing.\n\nSo why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2...\nThe servers, managers and everyone that had to answer a million questions from my mother-in-law. They were so friendly and genuine in their conversations. I am terrible and can't remember their names, but the staff that worked with our table saved the experience."
1;What happened to this place?  \n\nThey used to be so good, there were always nice and friendly baristas, the food was very simple, yet still very good.  But went in last time and I like to order the Veggie Hummus sandwich, but they forgot the cucumber and my bread stale and dry.  The sandwich was not worth my 7 bucks at all.  \n\nVery disappointed Fair Trade.
4;"A new slice of gastronomic heaven has opened in the northwest valley. Vogue Bistro and Bar, located in Marley Park at 15411 W. Waddell Rd. in Surprise is pleased to bring Cordon Bleu Culinary School trained Chef Aurore de Beauduy, most recently the former Chef at the Silverleaf Country Club located in DC Ranch in Scottsdale, to create contemporary American cuisine with a French bistro influence.  Now you can fulfill those gourmet desires Tuesday through Saturday,11:00 AM - Midnight or at Sunday Brunch from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM. They are closed Mondays. \n The ambiance is contemporary upscale with a crisp clean black and white d\u00e9cor. Located in the Bashas Shopping center on the far west end of the center, it's not at all what you would expect for a neighborhood bistro in Surprise. They have brought class to the area, with style and service you would expect in the finest cities of the world. But then many of the residents in Surprise and Sun City are world travelers who will return frequently for the more sophisticated dining experience near home. \n Our server, a delightful young lady, recommended a bottle of wine, Barro Rose Pinot Grigio from Italy (www.bacchannalwines.com) glass $9/ bottle $32 from the extensive wine list. Most of their wines are imported. We were pleased with her suggestion and the opportunity to taste two of her recommendations.  \n Vogue owner Roman Yasinsky suggested Frito Misto $4 the tempura-fried calamari, seasonal vegetables, ginger bits, with a light aioli dip. He brought us an extra spicy dip to try as well. The presentation is delightful with swirled crisps piled high. Both dips and the calamari were very nice.  \nAdditional \""Starters\"" on the menu include Bruschetta $3 with Chef Aurore's daily topping selection; Escargot $7 a delicate escargot sauteed in herb infused garlic butter and baked in a puff pastry; Smoked Salmon $9 luxurious house-smoked salmon, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pickled caperberries, red onion, artisan toast points. The smoked salmon is also available whole, for take out orders; Olives $7 house-marinated premium Mediterranean olives; Artisan Cuts $9 country-style p\u00e2te, assorted artisan sausages, salami and cured meats, olives, toasted almonds, Dijon mustard and warm handcrafted bread; Skewer $7 a daily selection of skewer grilled savory meats or seafood served with local seasonal greens and shaved Parmesan; Cheese $7 fine artisan cheeses from the world's best producers. \n Next chef sent us a delicious Burotta Cheese Caprese $8. The creamy cheese from Italy is a special appetizer/salad not on the menu, and a unique twist on the traditional Caprese. Fresh basil and tomato accented with an Italian balsamic and this heavenly cheese that melts in your mouth instantly, lighter and sweeter than a traditional mozzarella. It was very much a pleasant surprise to experience something new and so delicious. \n The Vogue Salad $8 with frisee, arugula, gorgonzola blue cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, pumpkin seeds and bits of applewood-smoked bacon tossed in warm sherry vinaigrette can be a meal in itself when topped with steak $4, chicken $4 or fish $4. The flavors of each unique ingredient combine to a flavor explosion so wonderful and satisfying.  \nIn addition to the wonderful list of basics on the menu everyday, Chef Aurore prepares specials and I was luck enough to experience her Duck seared breast confit paired with red cabbage in a fig emulsion $28. Tender and flavorful, the duck had a fig emulsion sauce that complemented the red cabbage perfectly. It was accompanied by a butternut squash souffl\u00e9 that was more like a dessert with its naturally sweet light as air texture. \n My dining companion enjoyed a Chilean Sea Bass $17 with endive and burotta cheese, basil and vinaigrette. Extremely light with a mild flavor, the bass is a good choice for warm summer dinners.   \n Other entrees on the menu include Steak Frites $15, all natural, prime grade Black Angus onglet steak prepared \""medium rare\"" with brandied peppercorn sauce and served with Vogue Fries; Roasted Chicken $15, half chicken slowly roasted to perfection in herb-garlic jus, and served with Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted carrots; Fish $15, daily seasonal fish served with roasted sweet potatoes, local greens and warm citrus. She'll also be doing daily specials like osso buco, daurade, foie gras, cassoulet and duck confit. \n Under the category of \""Accessories\"" you will find some unusual but exciting offerings. Vogue Fries $3 are incredible according to several sources. Crisp and delicious, they are a perfect accompaniment to any sandwich or entrees and are served with a savory dipping sauce. I can't wait to return to try the Sweet Potato Fries $3 described as luscious and healthy on the menu, but \""orgasmic\"" by a fellow diner. Vanilla Butternut Squash $3 is local organic butternut squash with vanilla beans, and Georgia pecans caramelized in maple syrup. too long again azphm .com for more... I have more pics too!"
1;Cloud 9, went on a non busy day, as i hear this place gets packed on busy nights, i like to relax and talk to my buddies.  Vibe is good, dark room with nice color changing lights and some electronic music, Just what i like.\n\nMe and my buddy walked down to the counter requesting a seat and menu, the guy working there followed us to where we wanted to sit, and gave us the menu and walked away. It took us 5 minutes to finally decide what flavor of hookah we wanted. Just like a restaurant, would you walk up to a waiter and give them your order, or would you wait for them? We waited for a long 15 to 20 minutes before he came back to take our order. It was a fast delivery, which was nice, took 3 minutes to have them set it up and on coals.\n\nThere was no follow up, the bowl started to get harsh after 15 more minutes i walked up and asked if he could blow it out or whatever to make it less harsh, i would mess around with the coals a bit, flip them move them but since cloud 9 doesn't provide tongs, i just used whatever i found to toss the coals around the bowl, which was a quarter i had in my pocket.\n\nService was slow, on a slow day, the couches were quite dirty and worn out, music was great, i like their selection of whatever they were playing, Hookah was average, if only service was better the rating i would give would be better. i've been here 3 times and all those times my experiences were below average.
2;Average sushi.  Young crowd.  Good happy hour.  Much better sushi can be had elsewhere, but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing.  I used to come here when I was in college if that tells you anything...
0;"Stay away!\n\nI have never had a worse breakfast experience. I used to live in the apartments right across the street, so I thought it would be a convenient place for a weekend brunch. Boyfriend and I headed over there one Saturday morning to check it out. I ordered a veggie skillet, and he ordered a make-your-own omelet. The menu description for my skillet said \""fresh cut veggies.\"" It came out with cauliflower and crinkled carrots. When I raised that point to our waitress, she giggled and said \""freshly frozen!\"" Boyfriend's omelet also came out with only half the ingredients he ordered, and one that he didn't. The only good thing about this place is that they adjusted the check appropriately for our meals."
3;We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.
3;Not only are the drinks delicious, but the service is out of the world! They are extremely friendly and love to chat. As for the drinks, they don't have as large of a menu as Starbucks, but they a lot more fun flavors for people who don't just want coffee. Also, a lot of them taste better than those at Starbucks.
3;I wouldn't say calling in at 1130pm on my way home last night was one of my best decisions but it was definitely up there as one of them!\n\nBrewdog is a small chain but one which beats to an ultra independent and 'them and us' attitude when it comes to taking on the generic and bland pubs of the high street. \n\nIf the truth be told, I've started to get a little bored of their core range of beers and prefer to go for something a little bit limited release (Brewdog are the masters of brewing tons of random brews each year - each with mixed results) or treat myself to one of their many guest bottles from either home or abroad (mainly USA craft)\n\nLast night I enjoyed some Bear republic and I'd highly recommend trying anything from this brewery. \n\nThe vibe at this time of night was what you'd call relaxed but with an edge. The clientele was mid 20's to 50's - with everyone quaffing while listening to some quality LCD soundsystem pumping out of the speakers - this for me was the highlight as I love a good place that gets the music loud enough that you can really feel it, but then still is just right to chat with your pal. \n\nThe Edinburgh bar is one of my fave brewdogs in UK - the only thing that let's it down is the quite rancid toilets which are like something from a small and pokey local train - with a smell to match! \n\nGo here for good beer and good vibes - it's as simple as that
3;Finally made it to Matt's for breakfast.  I had to check out the hype and see if it is what everyone says it is!  I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here.
2;"Pretty decent New Mexican food. Chimichanga was a bit soggy and serving sizes could be larger.\n\nNothing extremely \""New Mexican\"" about this place. The owner was pretty cool though. All in all this is just cafe style mexican food a tiny step above a place like Filibertos and a step below Arribas. You can take it from there.\n\n\nIf you want a real treat and a good dive, try Elmers tacos. Much better although it's in the geto."
0;We arrived around 10pm after a long drive, checked in, but I alone lugged all of the bags to the room, while my girlfriend ran an errand, only to find it messed up and not clean. The bed was all torn up, towels all over the floor, trash in the trash cans, iron out, completely disheveled. So I called and was told to return to registration for a new room, meaning that I had to lug the bags all the way back to the registration desk. I was given a new room alright, but no apology, nothing. In fact, both the worker on the phone and the registration clerk acted like this was a perfectly normal situation. Too tired to jump to a different hotel tonight, but we cancelled our remaining days and moved to a different hotel in the morning--even paying extra for an early check-in. This was my first and last stay at SouthPoint, and I refrained from gambling or spending any additional $$ in the restaurants. I don't know about you, but it feels really gross to walk into someone else's unclean hotel room when you are expecting a nice clean squared away typical hotel experience.
1;Server was great, ambiance nice, decor very cool. Veggies and hummus dip were good and popcorn was nice to munch on. Ordered a small garden salad and was extremely disappointed at the few pieces of lettuce that arrived. Nothing else just a few pieces of lettuce. Friend ordered grilled chicken salad. Same thing- few stray pieces of lettuce and very small piece of chicken. Others ordered beet burger and pleased. I'll know better next time!
1;This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd.
4;Great views from this third floor restaurant at the Cosmopolitan. Greek menu items made with the freshest ingredients. One of the most popular seafood restaurants in Toronto, Canada. Vegas is lucky to have this here!  Sea bass was mild and delicious. Beef tenderloin was flavorful and tender. We had the traditional Greek tomato salad with Feta. Very fresh and flavorful. Save room for their Baklava, which melts in your mouth. Service was attentive, especially since we were there with a large group.
4;Not just coffee, but don't forget the tea!  Great loose leaf blends and knowledgeable staff to coach on steeping times and the varieties.  They could even cite the amount of caffeine in each. Very impressive.... cannot wait to try the coffee.
1;Good recipes, nice atmosphere, and an interesting menu are frequently ruined by inattentiveness in the kitchen.  Meats are often dry, tough, and overcooked, though the vegetarian options are still delicious.  Ali Baba is a place with a lot of potential, but it needs more skilled professionals behind the curtain.\n\n(Also, the water glasses are unusually small, requiring many refills and usually causing periods without water during a meal--you can ask for a bigger one, though, something I didn't learn until my third visit.)
2;Good portions. Service ok. Food quality questionable. Still a new location so maybe they'll get better?  Sort of expensive.
2;Overall, just an okay buffet.  Upon initial view, you would think that you are about to get exposed to a lot of food, but truly, there are just a limited variety of foods that you are getting.  You basically have a Mexican station, Asian section, Italian section, and things off the grill.  Add some cold shrimp and crab legs and that is the vast majority of the food items.  Through in a huge assortment of desserts from ice cream to lemon tarts, and you pretty much have the entire food line up.
3;Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!
2;"My normal Massage Envy Spa is the one off Green Valley and Pebble, but this one is close to my work and I needed to use up some points before they expired so I came here for a facial.  So, I booked a same-day appointment and came here for my lunch one day!\n\nThe parking lot is definitely bustling with activity as there are a LOT of businesses here, so I'd suggest just going to the far back rows and parking.  Just be careful of walking since you'll be trekking across the busy driveway entrance.\n\nInside it's a little smaller than the one I'm used to, but still pretty nice.  Checked in, filled out paperwork for the facial, then sat in the quiet room.  Quiet room isn't terribly quiet though as you can hear the chatter of outside.  Doesn't really affect me one way or the other but if you're trying to relax it may suck.\n\nMy facial lady came out a few minutes after my appointment and apologized for being late; apparently the front didn't tell her that she had another appointment.  Happens I guess - never had any sort of problems like that with the other location.\n\nWe go in and do the facial biz which was nice and relaxing, and she actually gave me the couple extra minutes back (she apologized again for being tardy) even though she had another appointment after me - super cool.  I go out to check-out and one girl was on the computer looking intently at something (no customer in front of her, mind you) and the other lady was assisting someone.\n\nSo, I used the restroom and came back and the aesthetician had put some suggestions up on the counter.  The lady at the front started automatically scanning them and I was like, \""Yeah not today, thanks.\""\n\nI am REALLY not a big fan of upselling when you just assume the customer is going to purchase whatever is there.  Otherwise, this would be a solid 4-star location."
0;"I used to go to Eli's awhile ago to dance with my husband as they always have a live band. It is a strange mix of people, mostly an older crowd of regulars. Last year we went there 5 minutes before start of Super Bowl. The place was empty, but every single table said reserved, so since we were just walk-ins even though no one was there, our money was not needed, so we left and went to Goldies Sports Bar. Guess they thought all those people who reserved those seats and did not pay a fee to reserve were all gonna show up. Now, a year later we show up 10 minutes before World Series. Maybe 10 people in the whole place, with the exception of a group of parents getting ready to walk over to the Chapparal High School game. We stand at the empty Hostess booth waiting to be seated and after about 5 minutes get our own menus and seat ourselves. All the TV's were on, but not on the Freakin World Series!!! R u kidding me, I am in a sports bar right? So, my husband finds the bar guy actually going behind the bar from coming out of the kitchen and asks him if he could put the game on, he grumpily says, \""I will get to it\"" and proceeds to go prep and wash the glasses in the bar, never bothering with the TV's. Then a waitress looks at us and hurridly  keeps on walking. Note, not one person is being served a damn thing while we just look around wondering WTF. Then a buxom blonde waitress walks by and asks if we have been waited on. We tell her actually no, we got our own menus and seated ourselves. She doesn't say, \"" I will have someone be right with you, NO, she says \""we are busy\"" and proceeds to take off into knowhere land. We look at each other in stunned belief.  I am not going to beg someone to take my money in this economy. We head over Goldies Sports Bar once again where we are greeted and waited on with a welcome smile in a very packed bar while the World series blares from the multiple big screens. I just had to write this because if an Owner of a business has those type of employees who think they can just pick and choose who to cater too, I won't feel sorry when it eventually tanks and in this economy, it doesn't matter how long u have been around."
3;Poppy's Bagel's is definitely worth the stop!\n\nI'm loving it.  They really did have great bagels.  Great crisp outside, soft doughy inside.  This place was recommended to me by another Yelper and I'm glad she did.\n\nI had to battle some traffic to get there but it was worth the wait and made for an excellent breakfast.  They have an excellent assortment of cream cheeses and a large inventory of bagels.  Line was short so it didn't take forever.  \n\nI wasn't a fan of the coffee, but the bagel made up for it!  I ordered for my team at work and we had everything bagels with plain cream cheese and blueberry bagels with blueberry cream cheese.
3;Salut is in an entirely unassuming part of Tempe, but it's a happy surprise! Once inside this little restaurant in a newer strip mall, it's a delightful eatery filled with character and personality. Once inside, you'd never know what was around you on the outside. The atmosphere is intimate and charming with dark wooden and metal features, dining table spread throughout the restaurant and a large bar taking up a lot of the space. They also have a small patio that is dog friendly!\n\nFirst off, the happy hour here is amazing. They do $5 bottles of house wine and you don't even have to open it there. You could just simply take it home with you! \n\nI recently dined here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage and found it to be a perfect restaurant before a show. It's just east of Rural on University but only about a 5-7 minute drive to the theater. My friend and I shared the bruschetta and the corn and goat cheese salad. You get to choose four bruschettas for $12 and each one is cut into two. The salad was on the smaller side. After eating the meal, I think we could have gotten one more item to share in order to leave completely full, but the food was excellent! I think I could have easily enjoyed the order of bruschetta to myself. We got four different kinds: Chicken & Hummus, Wild Mushroom, Fig, and Prosciutto with Apple. I really enjoyed all three but my two favorites were the Fig and Proscuitto. The bread was very soft and delicious. \n\nThe salad was flavorful complete with corn, goat cheese, chicken and avocado. It was a delicious salad but I wouldn't suggest splitting it if you're really hungry. Save it for yourself! \n\nThe food, environment and price was all very delightful and I will definitely return again for another visit!
0;Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
2;"Par to sub par for a AYCE sushi bar. \nNice atmosphere, decorating, lighting, outside seating, and open till 3am, are some of the selling points, but their fish pieces are small, sushi rice was borderline and their sashimi salad was a sad excuse. \nUnlike other AYCE, their soft shell crab is not included in the $27 price tag. \nTheir one redeeming item was their \""pork belly\"". Pretty incredible, actually. Ive never seen this item at other sushi bars, but after eating their sushi i understand why they added it to the menu....\nI suspect it's their only reason for success."
3;We walked like 2 miles to get here because we heard it was the best breakfast to get nearby the strip.  It's not in the nicest hotel/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.\n\nWe got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. \n\nWe had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. \n\nI got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.\n\nThe best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. \n\nThe only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!
0;Terrible chicken was old texture was odd and the food smelt foul!\nGROSS!!!!!
1;I've been going to Tony's since it opened in Ballantyne and always thought it to be the best in Charlotte. But since it was sold last year, it has gone downhill quickly.\n\nThe pizza has changed for the worst and one of my favorite menu items, Chicken Parm dinner tastes like a container of salt. Yes, it's not just one time but 3 times now the quality on this item is just too bad to eat and had to return it.\n\nAnd when at the counter and a customer asked for a pie with fresh mushrooms, the person on duty stated the mushrooms come from a can. \n\nFrom now on, I'm sticking with Lorenzo's which IS the best pizza in Charlotte.
0;"We ordered 4AYCE sushi buffets on a Friday evening for 90. I received a coupon in the mail, Buy 3 buffets, get 1 free.\n\n- Wonderful welcome. Nice smiles and quick to order drinks. \n- We got there at 6. As it got towards 630 - 7ish, service fell apart big time.\n- When you enter, it will say SERVER WANTED! What they need are more EFFICIENT SERVERS. \n- Servers can't spell! I had to spell out LASAGNA for her. It literally took 1min. Others also, Jones roll...ect..\n- Our orders NOT going to our table. I saw my hamachi nigiri being handed off to another table. It wasn't just that, it happened on 2 other occasions.\n- We ordered UDON, and our ICE CREAM came first. WTF...no more udon. CANCEL\n- Servers look so CONFUSED. we had ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD to OBSERVE their every move bc there was NO FOOD on our table. \""UHH, WHAT TABLE? 7! 7! no, 9! HUH?\"" LOL. you can see the sushi chef popping a blood vessel. \n- BTW, only one sushi chef! ONE!? WTF. the other guy was probably the sous chef.\n- We had quite a bit of sushi rolls. In general, all I can say that they tasted SOGGY! they DRENCH their sushi in this spicy sauce. it makes it worse..ughh FAIL\n- Salmon skin roll is good. WIN\n- This establishment is going down...that coupon wasn't even worth it. \n- AVOID.."
3;I love crepes and this is a good place to get your crepe fix. Their Crepe menu is pretty big and you will definitely find something to your liking. \n\nI came here on a Sunday and luckily I made it before the rush came in. Once the rush was in around 12p there was a wait averaging 10-15 minutes. This wait can be eternity especially after a good night out in the city. \n\nI would definitely come back and maybe next time try a sweet Crepe
3;"We tried this place because there was a coupon in the Entertainment Book. Since we like the mexican restaurant inside the Tuscany, we figured it was worth trying.\n\nWe had two sandwiches- we split it (our MO). It was very good, surprisingly, for a casino cafe. It's about $10 per person, without the Entertainment coupon. We've been here a couple times. The service is very good. The atmosphere is nice, and this restaurant is spacious inside. There are tables and chairs as well as booth seating available. \n\nIt's truly \""hit or miss\"" at these casino cafes. This is probably one of those little known/forgotten casinos and two of the restaurants here are really good."
0;I ordered their cafe latte, it was so plain and no coffee taste at all! Wouldn't visit their store a second time
1;"My husband and I did not have a good experience here. I saw on the menu online that they have bruschetta, and so I was craving it for about a week. When we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  We seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. The waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. Um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. Sue me. So we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. The bruschetta was so-so; not quite what I wanted. We got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. They were a bit sparse with the toppings. The salad was actually very good, but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. Overall I will not be back. I will stick with Postino's."
4;When I first got my puppy she was matted and had a string tied around her tail (whoever had her before had tried to crop it at home, I rescued her). Crystal has taken extra special care of my little girl from day one! My dog loves going to her, she gets so excited to see her. My pup always looks adorable when she comes back home! I always get very detailed report cards from Crystal, which means she's paying attention to my pup's needs. I discuss what's going on with my dog before the groom and Crystal makes awesome suggestions regarding whatever needs my dog has (i.e.. more conditioning in the winter, shorter cut in the summer, even which type of glucose she suggests). I send all my friends with animals to her, and now I'm doing the same with you! Hope your pets are happy and shiny!
1;We went to hakkasan on a Saturday night during the canelo vs may weather fight.  This place was jam packed with a classy bunch of people.  We were able to get in by showing up early around 9ish.  The $125 cover for guys and $50 for girls was steep.   \n\nCalvin Harris played a little bit at the show but it was mainly another DJ that looked like Calvin harris.  They lights and music levels were high quality.  Getting to the dance floor was way too crammed and it could take 15 min to move around in the club.  \n\nThe club was nice but way overpriced and overcrowded.  \nThe marquee is definitely better than hakkasan.  would not pay anywhere near that amount for the hakkassan again.  but you never know unless you play the game !
1;"One hot Arizona evening my mom and I were wondering around Tempe looking for decorations for a float for an upcoming parade when we happened upon several restuants in a row... not knowing where to go, the only thing my mom could say was \""Anywhere but Manuel's!\"" I started to read off the different signs and she said, oh! let's try Rice King... ummm... sure I said. \n\nWe entered the DESERTED dining room around 5:30 PM, in the middle of what normally is the dinner time rush... but not a soul in sight - NOT a good sign! We went through their mini gauntlet of fake plants and approached the counter infront of a VERY old sign displaying their menu. Straight out the 80s. Old worn out photos of their signature dishes were warped and dingy looking. I honestly had a positive outlook, I was hoping for the best and gladly ordered the Lemon Chicken and my mom ordered the Cashew Nut Chicken from the nice Chinese man who ran the place.\n\nWe paid our $18 for our meals, got our drinks and sat down. I would like to say that Rice King's food is where the old meets the new. Not old traditions meet new techniques and fresh ingredients... more like... old ingredients meet old techniques drenched in newly thinned out sauce. *shudders* \n\nFirst came our egg drop soup served in a small styraphone cup. It was lukewarm... like a single serving of incubation soup. It had a decent flavor but when I bit into one pea... it was disgusting! I couldn't take it! It tasted like the once frozen pea had freezer burn! My mom quit eating hers after two bites and I got through it all except for the peas.\n\nNext came our meals. Check the pictures for how the looked... it was a big plate of beige. The Lemon chicken would have been decent but the sauce was old and gloopy and not very hot. The chicken itself was an old filet but the batter was nice and light and crispy. I started to just eat the crispy skin. The rice was hardening and hosted more of the freezer burned peas. It was slightly peppery again, would have been good if it were freshly made. The eggroll was the best part of the meal... if only it were larger than my thumb! The sweet & sour sauce it came with was watered down so much it was literally flavorless. However it did come with some friend wontons which gave a nice crunch to things. \n\nThe cashier was friendly, which earned them another star. But man, the food was baaaad. We only finished it because we were starving! When we left we wished we had gone to Manuel's after all!"
1;It was a nice evening and headed for work then suddenly the manager called saying we are close today. I never had eaten that day because I though I was already late. \nPassed by this wendy's so I went inside and had a meal. \nThe only thing that was really bad wendy's was their service. The food here was a little good. The place was also recommendable but the service is not.
2;I went to Gelato 64 because I was looking for a place to go for dessert after a charity event in Gilbert, and this place was the only gelato shop nearby that was open until 11pm on a Friday.  The people working here were cool and let my friends and I sample as many flavors as we wanted (and there were a lot) before we made our decisions.  The gelato selections are great and varied with flavors like mascarpone, peanut butter, coconut, and some tropical mix of guava, mango, and papaya, I think.  I ended up getting the blueberry, and it was really good!  I can't say that Gelato 64 was AWESOME, but I can't say that it sucked, either.  It's just your standard gelato shop (with maybe more flavors) that does the job of satisfying your craving.  The prices are fine, parking is not a problem, and the people working there are your standard employees who are just working to work and not really cuz they have a passion for gelato.  So...overall, I may or may not go back at some point in the future, but it's not like I'm rushing to get back there.  I'm also not crossing it off my list of places to boycott.  Gelato 64 is just fine.  \n\nPS: When I went, the smell of Lysol or whatever cleaning product they were using was really overwhelming, and my friends and I couldn't wait to pay and get outside, but I'm not really counting that as a negative per se.  At least I know that they're cleaning.  Just wanted to give you all a heads up.
3;Always has a good selection of local beers on tap. There deli makes delicious sandwiches fresh and fast. They also have a wide variety of craft beer on sale. They make there own brand of coffee sold by the counter and also carry Zapps chips from Louisiana which are the best brand of kettle chips known to man
3;Surprisingly, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious!\n\nGrilled Chicken Salad - good enough\n\nSpud Max - great! I would definitely get this again.  The Spud Max includes: bacon, cheddar cheese, scallions, and ham.  Add sour cream, and I am in heaven!
2;I liked Amarone, but not sure if I'd be back.  The food was good in a homey family style way, but the prices veer toward fine dining.  My favorite part was the complementary flat bread and dip.  The home made pasta were also good.  \n\nMay be my expectations were set too high given all the positive press that they have been recieiving.
3;Great matzo ball soup! This place is very filling. All of their bread is delicious here. Obviously they're all about bagels, and their bacon, egg and cheese is typically my favorite. It's a greasy bagel because they make that bacon sizzle so you've been warned if greasy isn't your thing. When it comes to cream cheese, many places that serve bagels only give you a small portion barely enough to spread but not here! They lather it on so thick you have to eat it slice by slice rather than as a bagel sandwich. Some of my friends think it's too much and they like to take some off or just order it with less but I love cream cheese goodness on every bite. Each order is made as you like it so if you don't want it to be cream cheese with a side of bagel like me then simply tell them to go light on the cream cheese. This place aims to serve and they do it well.
4;I love this theater !!!  $2 Tuesday's Cheap popcorn and soda and there seats are so comfortable!!
0;Made a reservation for 7:15pm. Got there at 7:20. Was super loud!!!! Was told I could be seated and then given a pager and told it would be a 5 minute wait. 30 minutes later I still wasn't seated and I gave back the pager and left. WTF?  Why make a reservation if it is meaningless???\nI'm over overrated noisey overpriced Fox restaurants. Bye bye
0;If this is your favourite restaurant, you need to get out more. \n\nWe had ribs and Amarillo chicken - the ribs were the blandest ribs I've ever had, and my Amarillo chicken tasted like a piece of chicken had been thrown in the oven, with a slice of processed cheese dumped on top. The seasoned vegetables were 3 sprigs of broccoli, 2 pieces of mini corn and 1 carrot stick. The service was helpful where possible, but they had far too many tables to look after to provide real service. We had to flag down the server every time.
4;Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!\nCornbread is sick !!!\nAlso try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. \nMy fav place in CU
4;This is real magic.  I know people think he is a tired act, but he is the originator.  Houdini did great things, but Copperfield is the showman of our time.  Amazing tricks...funny jokes...touching moments about his childhood (especially the story about his father).  I will not give away too much.\n\nFirst...the dude looks like he is in his 20s.  That right there is magic.  \n\nSecond...he doesn't talk with a lisp and tell stupid jokes *cough* Criss Angel *cough*\n\nThird....his tricks are not overly produced.  He doesn't have a ton of smoke and mirrors and crazy lights *cough* Criss Angel again *cough*.  He does the stuff right in front of you.  I am talking right next to you in the audience...somebody levitated.  I know it is a trick, but that is an entertaining trick.\n\nFourth...he likes to use attractive women from the audience to help him.  He has some kind of hotness detector that spots these women.  I am always hoping that as part of the trick he makes something pop out that shouldn't pop out.  I have seen him 3 times now and no such luck.\n\nFifth...the room he performs is tiny.  You are right next to him.  You can tell he has done this and perfected it for a long time.  You can tell he has respect for his craft.\n\nSixth...he makes fun of himself some.  This is a bit refreshing because most magicians seem to think they are mystics and actually have powers *cough* Criss Angel *cough* *big cough* David Blane *big cough*.\n\nSeventh...he tries new stuff.  You can tell he gets bored with the same old tricks, which is why if you have seen him once then you need to see him again.  You will see new stuff.  The entire show will not be new but you will see new tricks that are amazing.  Also, it is a reasonably priced show and according to my wife it looks saucy to post on facebook that we saw David Copperfield.
0;What a horrible experience. The hotel was so pricey. I was expecting a gorgeous room. Instead, the room was just mediocre. There was nothing special about the room I stayed in. I thought, from reading the description online, that the hotel was a more upscale approach to the ceasars hotel and casino. But it reminded me of a motel. The bathroom shower had no door, so it was so cold to take a shower. But I can deal with a crappy hotel room. The problem was the staff and manager. I had trouble checking in on arrival. I asked to speak to the manager but they told me he was In a meeting. Mind you it was almost 10 pm!! What sorta meeting goes on that late?! But instead of meeting with us in person. He calls the room cause I imagine he didn't want to bother to leave his office to talk to us in person. I merely had a simple complaint about the check in process but he had no sympathy or care. I wasn't looking for any sort of freebie or compensation. I just simply had a suggestion on how he could tell his staff how to deal with the situation. But that's the last time I go to this hotel and Casino. The customer service there needs help. It might need a new manager to get that hotel to where It should be. But until then I'm going to be staying at the Bellagio. It's the same price as the Nobu but it has the best customer service and gorgeous rooms. It's sad for Nobu/Ceasars cause I visit Vegas quite often. Oh well.
3;Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
0;"I am not one to totally trash a business, because I understand that once in a while even the best run business can have a off night, but I can honestly say this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, and I have no problem at all posting my review. \n\nWe went there for the \""All you can eat fish Fry\"" only because we saw an ad and had coupons. While it was a buffet, it was not \""all you can eat\"" as the food was not replenished enough. The food was cold, and they didn't have your typical \""fish fry\"" dishes like cole slaw, french fries, mac and cheese. Instead there was a horrendous selection of lasagna, some sort of stuffed pork dish, stuffing, gravy and some sort of pudding item for dessert. \n\nOn top of all that, the staff was rude. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the cashier, who when she finally cashed us out didn't ask us how the food was, or engage in any sort of pleasantries. \n\nStay away from this join, far away."
0;"Another review liken this 'animal hospital' to a dealership. In a way I agree, except that comparison may be giving Centennial Hills Animal Hospital (CHAM) too much credit and is too unfair to dealerships. \n\nThe experience is so unpleasant I don't actually want to author this review. It is possible that for the purposes of routine shots and other 40$ treatments/procedures/matters, this animal hospital is perfectly fine. You may want to consider if it is fine or not, but I don't believe for larger, serious procedures (surgery) you should consider CHAM at all. If you are reading this because there may be something seriously wrong with your smaller animal friend, and your first choice is not to kill them, start looking for a different option now. Don't even finish reading this overly long review; just look for another Animal Hospital, please. You're welcome.\n\nThe cat that lives with us was sick. She was vomiting constantly, quite violently. We meant to take her to a higher rated Animal Hospital that is in the same area, but there was an error committed in mapping out the directions so we came to CHAM instead. What followed was the doctor taking a series of xrays (one of which was taken incorrectly, which I had to pay to have retaken at another hospital) and going to the HIGH side of a quote instantaneously. Her recommendation was so extreme (barium GI tract exploration) that the other hospital would not even believe that it was recommended by a veterinarian.  \n\nWhen we asked if it were possible that the xrays results be given to us in hard form so we could get another opinion when the veterinarian was going to show us her findings (this is post-the barium recommendation), she abruptly shut down the presentation/sales pitch for barium and stormed out of the room. It was like a bad SNL skit (think Will Ferrell as a doctor). \n\nThey charged an extra 5$ for the CD that the xray results were placed in. \n\nIn the end, the poor cat was just constipated. You can't make this shit up. - E"
3;This Costco is our local.  Sometimes the weekends can be really busy but if you go on Thursday or Friday night it can be a quick trip.\nGas station on site is cheap (of course) but always busy.
1;Good value for fresh food fast and cheap however poor customer service is why I will only give this restaurant 2 stars. Line staff was extremely rude and rushed order. I eat at other locations and knew exactly what I wanted and I still felt rushed!!! Also staff tried to give me a dime size portion of meat on a taco order. When I asked for a more adequate serving I received a serving of attitude instead!
2;"This is another place that you wind up going when you have been killed by the prices at all the other restaurants/buffets on the Strip. Right inside NY NY Casino, you'll think, \""Hey, the prices can't be too awful since it's a deli.\"" And you're right. It's not *that* cheap, but it's also not ridiculously expensive.\n\nAnd it's a sandwich. That's all. \n\nAnother place in Vegas that I went once and probably won't go again. Although I can't see this place actually getting closed and replaced. It seems like it just kind of fits in their whole theme."
0;"I went to the bar last night (sat) and it took FOREVER to get my drink. I order a Long Island, when I got it the drink was CLEAR! I told the bartender \""Ashely\"" that my drink wasn't right and she had the nerve to take a drink out of my drink and told me \""it taste fine and I not making you a new one\""! WTF don't ever go here!"
2;I love this place but something was very off the last time I went there.  I took my wife there for our 3rd anniversary.  \n\nWe had a reservation and we showed up 10 minutes early but it still took almost half an hour to be seated.  This was weird because other people were coming in without reservations and being seated ahead of us.  But to be fair, I requested a patio seat.  But then again, one of the couples that came in after us and seated before us was on the patio.\n\nWe were greeted by a great host once we were seated who apologized for the wait and wished us a happy anniversary.  But once he left, it took a good 15 minutes before we could place an order.  The appetizers came within 10 minutes but our steaks took almost an hour.  The waiter did apologize for the wait but it was disheartening to see other people seated after us getting their food before us.  \n\nThe first round of drinks came very quickly but the second took so long that we wondering if it was going to make it before we got the check.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night for them.  The food - as always - was amazing but the service was really really slow.  To be fair, it was a Wednesday night and the place was really busy.  \n\nIn all, it was not an ideal way to celebrate my anniversary.
3;Would have a had a 5-star if the wait and service was better.\n\nFood is amazing. They deliver on the twisted farm food promise.  \n\nThe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive.
1;"I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle, so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.\n\nThe first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends; if memory serves me correctly, the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins.  There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.\n\nRegarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.\n\nThe service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.  If you're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $20 or less, you can't beat the pricing here."
2;"Billed as \""the most luxurious gentlemen's club\"" in Vegas, Treasures definitely tries to live up to its name. I showed up on a Thursday night for a bachelor party and were greeted with a $30 cover, which is pretty much standard for Vegas. We were able to sit immediately and drinks were procured at the bar. 3 Jamesons on the rocks = $39. 2 shots of Patron = $40. I guess \""luxurious\"" means \""ridiculously expensive.\"" \n\nWhile the girls were nice (not pushy, not mean) and the staff was too, I couldn't get past how insanely overpriced the booze was. Even the Heinekins were, like, $12 or $14 (I can't remember because at that point I simply stopped looking, because the only way to enjoy myself was to pretend like I wasn't getting raped by the bartender every time I was thirsty). \n\nOverall, it's an alright club. Not a single girl on stage did anything other than strut around (disappointing when you're from Portland and the girls here do insane pole acrobatics) so there's ZERO reason to sit at the rack. Drink before you go, or maybe go for the bottle service? I generally avoid bottle service, but the drinks are so expensive that it might be worth it. You're better off showing up toasted or smuggling in a flask. \n\nThis is definitely not my first choice for adult entertainment in Vegas unless someone else is footing the bill. The level of \""luxury\"" they offered me (standard strip club chair, standard strip club table, same drinks as anywhere else) is not worth the luxury price I paid. Maybe if a high-roller is rolling with me footing the bill, I'd be into it. \n\nIt blows the Rhino out of the water, tho."
2;Great food crappy service and they tried to over charge us for 2 drinks wow!! I was shocked how our waitress kept walking passed us we had to ask 2 other people to help just to get place our order and get drinks.
0;The only reason I give the store one star is so people don't think I forgot to rate it is not worth one star. Walking through the store it smelled like rotten meat was filthy there's crap on the floor in most every aisle. One of the meat refrigerators was leaking from rotten chicken my girlfriend slipped on the floor and hurt herself. I would stay away from this piece of crap store is the worst store ive ever been in my life. Ghetto is to kind of a word for this store it was terrible I will not be back.
0;Extremely long wait. Over an hour. The sign says to please inform them if you've waited longer than 15 minutes but since the place was packed I gave them 20. When I asked one of the receptionists she said I've already been called. I said I've been sitting there the entire time and didn't hear anybody call my name. She said she's informing the person in-charge and they will call me when they're ready to take me in. I waited for another 20 minutes before asking again. It was a different person this time as the other lady was helping a couple and she was confused why I wasn't called since my barcodes were all printed out. I sat for another 25 minutes before I finally got called. Never coming back.
4;This place is great! The garlic knots and the Penne A La Vodka pasta was terrific, and the pizza was delicious and very NYC style. Definitely will go back! Normally I only come on here to put up any crappy service I get but I had to put how great it was. I Recommend this place
4;I have been going for a few months regularly and I love the facility and the staff. Dr. Brim is an amazing chiropractor. He takes the time to understand your personal needs and creates a plan to get you on the right track.
0;June 25, 2014: Normally this place has pretty good food. Their pretzels with cheese are really good. Today my work colleagues and I went to Pranksters for lunch. When we got there we immediately were overwhelmed by the smell of urinal cakes and raw sewage. It was overwhelming but when we asked the waitress about it, she said she didn't notice it.  Really?  I think she was instructed not to acknowledge it if customers were to ask about it. How could she NOT notice?\n\nUpdate: July 18: my co workers and I went back, expecting that the odor would be now resolved. No luck. We walked in, took one breath, and were hit with the exact same odor as 4 weeks prior. We turned around and got back in the car. A man, I presume was the manager, followed us outside and apologized and told us they had someone coming to address it later that day. \n\nI can't imagine going back again.
1;"A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve:\n\nI don't know what it IS, but I can tell you what its NOT, and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'.\n\nHow do I know this?  Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.\n\nPizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.\n\nNow some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?).\n\nDo yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done.\n\nYour one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.\n\nKeep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer.\n\nViewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch.\n\nCome for the beer, stay for the... beer.  But if I've been too subtle, and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'."
3;I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point.
1;No customer service at all. None. Zero. Nada. Zilch.
2;Typical LA Fitness. This one has a lap pool and decent equipment. If you want to go when it isn't busy go around 11-3 and 9 to close. From what I seen those times there isn't a lot of people there. I hate waiting for weights or machines to open especially when you have people that keep talking and hanging out.
1;Cowboys and gangsters and mechanical bull riding and cheap booze and wet  shirt contests and random concerts and beer tub girls in ass-less chaps. How can you fuck this up? Graham Central Station is so ridiculous that it should be awesome.\n\nBut it isn't. Somehow. HOW?\n\nThis place is a huge mess. Every person in here frightens me. \n\nI guess  you could get totally hammered and try to ignore the scariness and really party here. But I can't do it.\n\nBut I dare YOU to do it. If you do go here, please tell us alllllllll about it.
3;I am going to knock R&K down 1/2 star from my original review.  I know I can't give a 4.5 but that's what I want to do.  While they were great, I found out that they advertise on the radio for at least one services that no one needs.  Keep in mind though that the guy who came to our house did not pitch any service with a low ROI.\n\nAs a reminder the top 3 ROI projects for saving money on energy, from several experts I talked to who wanted to be off the record, were:\n\n1.  Seal vents\n2.  Insulate\n3.  Window shading\n\n[Now, this isn't in the top 3 but if you have an electric water heater then adding a timer will save you money.  Get an electrician (shop around) and the whole thing can be done for under $200.  Who needs to spend money heating water at 2am?  Not me.  That saved us money as well.]\n\nOur electric bill went down after R&K insulated.  Good deal.
2;If you happen to be in the Town Square location you should definitely stop by. It's located on the 2nd floor across from the movie theater parallel to Blue Martini. Customer service is ehh, but you're there for the food, not the conversation. All the seating is made up of stools facing the window. That's good cuz you really don't have to worry when you get the food all over your face and hands. Each time has been a good experience so far with 2 visits under the belt, each time visiting with my brother. Each time we ordered a fatty Olympian consisting of grilled corned beef, turkey, pastrami, onions, peppers & Swiss, plus coleslaw, 1000 island & tomato. From my stomach's perspective they are liking this sub shop. Overall it's a nice place to grab a quick bite while doing some shopping at this outdoor mall.
1;After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.
4;My oldest daughter got her braces off six years ago. My eldest son just got his braces off last year. my youngest son has just finished his phase one and my youngest daughter will start her phase one next year. \nWe have loved every minute of this process and I think my children's teeth are absolutely beautiful!  The office staff is so very kind and treat us like family. I feel blessed that I was referred to dr. Noorda when we moved to Vegas. Dr. Noorda is kind patient and intelligent. I highly recommend them.
1;It's funny----I had heard that Gus had good pie.  All I can say is it must taste really good when you're under the table.  When you are sober, it's pretty medicre pizza, folks, even if they do deliver at 3am.....
3;I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.
4;This place is fantastic! Old Vegas lives on. Food is incredible!
2;I went here for lunch and had decent food.  The view of the man made lake in the shopping center is pretty cool on a day when the weather is nice.  I went back again at night and they had a great DJ with an artist performing ( Truth of the QC), the place was pretty packed, and the drink specials were awesome.  I think I like this place as a night venue better.  I will be back, but not in a hurry because the University area is a hike from south Charlotte.  I had a fun time nonetheless.
4;Don't let the looks of the place deceive you.  The Meat Shop carries the best grass fed and local cuts of meat.  The butchers at this shop are super friendly and accommodating and will readily answer any questions you have.  You'll love all the meats here, but you have to try the bacon - it's like candy.
1;"Found this place with my girlfriend and although we enjoyed the decor, the customer service and food sucked. As soon as we got seated the waiter seemed as if she was in a rush, but the place was no where near busy. She took our orders, but never let us finish speaking because she kept interrupting us; again feeling \""rushed.\"" She gave us our food and asked what else we needed, and she forgot our utensils, in which she basically threw them onto our table; once again, rushing! The prices were way too high for the quality. I ordered a steak and it was not juicy, it was bland when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend ordered a southern style chicken fried steak and it did not taste like anything. The breading was horrible too. Paid almost $50 for just the two of us. Would not recommend this place."
2;I've been wanting to check out the Aloft brand since I travel so much and for the most part, I dig this brand. Love the sleek, mod look of the hotel and rooms. \n\nOnly problem,?? For all the sleek amenities, they couldn't give decent pillows!!! For the king size bed, they provided (2) pillows big enough for your 10 year old. That's the best way to describe it!! Kinda thrown off by that! \n\nI was basking in how much I like this hotel till I went to lay down and was shocked that they would skimp on such a small item. They use Bliss products in the bathroom but can't provide standard pillow sizes or decent pillows for that matter?? Surprised to say the least.\n\nChecked in on the later side and was glad there was food choices across the street. In addition, there is a food available for purchase in the lobby, salads, sandwiches, etc.\n\nThe hotel has a club vibe but there was a mixture of old and young. Business folks milling around but no families. Don't think this is the brand you would check your family into. \n\nDefinitely will check out the other Aloft properties while traveling.
0;"Thoroughly over-rated!\n\n7.50$ for a greasy polish sausage, covered in \""chili\"" that looks like a pile of poo-poo & tastes accordingly (( this stuff looked synthetic - im talking Taco Bell might be better)\n\nThe sausage was okay but it was super salty and greasy, the bun was completely soggy (think Wonderbread) & the chilli was honestly repulsive (I scooped as much as possible off before eating)\n\nThe relish and grilled onions were the only things that saved the day.\n\nI would seriously pick the  Costco hot dogs/polish sausages over this stuff any day!"
1;Bottom line --- Overpriced, mediocre sandwiches. Service moved at a snail's pace with only 2 customers ahead of me. I ordered the Johnny and the Buffalo Blazin' Chicken. Both came on a focaccia bread that gave me lock jaw. I am back on the saddle, on the look out for a NoDa restaurant I can endorse.
4;Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!
2;I was at the Phoenix airport for a stop in between my flights. I guess this place appealed to me because it was a new restaurant to me and I figured to give it a chance. It was a bad choice, but I don't fully regret it. \nPerhaps I made the first wrong move by creating my own burger. Along with choosing the sauteed mushrooms and guacamole, I expected the burger to come with more than just a lettuce and pickle wedge-- at least some of the basics (i.e. tomato, onions).\n\nThe service was OK, my waitress was very nice. But towards the end of my meal, I need to go to my gate soon and couldn't find her, so I had to ask someone else to give me my check. Luckily, I made it to my boarding time =D\n\nAnyways, the food did get me full, and if you're just there for a drink and to watch some sports this would be a place to go to.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of signs that this place would turn into a Barfly in February, but it didn't mention which date.\n\nHopefully since it will be a different restaurant, the food and choices will be better!
2;"I'll go ahead and start off my review with this: hash house has gigantic portions at reasonable prices ($12-$15 per entree).\n\nThat being said, I think that's where all the \""hype\"" is over here at hash house.  My friends and I decided to come here based on all of the great reviews of the place and waited for over an hour on a Friday morning.  I was surprised to see so many people at 10am, but I guess a Friday before a long weekend will do that kinda thing.\n\nFood-wise, I went ahead and took the advice of many of my fellow yelpers, and got the corned beef hash.  Piece of advice for those who don't already know....the hash's are literally gigantic pieces of _____ (whatever meat you may choose) over crispy potatoes/wedges. It is not easily mixable, as the potatoes that are given are also rather large.\n\nThe hash was good in itself, but definitely not what I was expecting.  Another one of my friends got the meatloaf hash which did not look too appetizing because they were just pieces of meatloaf chopped up over those crispy potatoes.\n\nThe pancakes looked ridiculously large but I did not try them.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting experience to try this place, but I felt that there was maybe a little too much hype surrounding this restaurant.\n\nQuick Tips:\n\n1) Expect to wait (just like any other popular place in LV)\n2) Portions are huge so you can easily split one dish among two people."
2;Had a convention here and the resort seemed a little dated for Vegas.  The staff was spot on and our convention went off without a hitch.  \nI worked a lot so I was not able to enjoy a lot of the hotel besides the dinning options. They were both really nice for a hotel.
4;"It's becoming harder and harder to find a store that sells a breadth of equipment, aquarium supplies, chemicals,  fish, and has knowledgeable sales people. Most PetSmarts and Petcos have fish departments and some, but not all, carry the more popular freshwater fish. But what if you have a question? Sure, they have an 18 year old on hand who can probably help answer questions that you could have just as easily googled but not with the more difficult questions.\n\nI found Ocean Floor years ago and it hasn't changed much over the years - and that's a good thing!  It's a well run, local business. You name it, they have it. And, they not only have it, they'll have a few to choose from. Not sure what to get? Every employee I've ever talked to was able to assist and answered questions that I didn't even think to ask.  \n\nI've purchased a number of fish from this store and I've never had a problem with them in my well maintained 55 gallon aquarium.  You'd be wise to sign up for their email newsletter (no, they don't spam you every day) - they have some pretty good sales on equipment, supplies and fish.\n\nYes, their prices are a bit higher than the chain stores but how important is it to save a dollar or two and either buy the wrong product or do some serious damage to your aquarium? I have too much invested to take the risk.\n\nFavorite fish quote:  \""I never drink water because of the disgusting things that fish do in it.\"" W. C. Fields"
4;"I'm not one to write reviews but I had to stop what I was doing to let you know how amazing Leah Joy is!!!\nNeed a last minute blow out, make up or color??? Leah Joy is the go to gal to make you feel beautiful. I love the fact that she is mobile and will come to you at a moments notice. She is incredible with an extension blow out (girls, please don't try to do this on your own, it's just not worth it). Want to look like a million bucks??? Cal Leah Joy ASAP!!!\nMake sure you get the \""beachy waves\"" blow out; there is honestly nothing better. She knows how to work the curling iron better than anyone I know. And my blow out can last almost a week. So what are you waiting for??? Make that call, you deserve this special treat, or in my case... Twice a week treat. Now, aren't you worth that??? look and feel your best, Leah Joy is the only person in the valley to call."
1;We have been to this location many times.  When you eat in the portions are fine but when you order out they cut the size of your order and still charge the same.  Last Friday we ate there, ordered the Mahi Mahi with vegetables and the fish portion was a decent size as was the vegetables.  On Sunday, 7-29, we ordered the same meal to go and when we got home the fish portion was half the size of the one when we ate in.  The amount of humus was also decreased.  \nThis is not the first time that has happened so if you are planning on getting and order to go make sure and look at the portions.  They seen to give less for the same price figuring that you wont see that till you get home.
0;So I saw the Martinez taco bar in the middle of a nice little shopping center and I thought why not let's give it a try, I enjoy new things. It was rush hour for dinner time and the place was empty so I was a little skeptical to begin with. The clerk who came up to the register to take my order looked as though he had just done some crystal meth in the back which isn't unusual for small Vegas restaurants. I decided to order the $9 carne asada burrito with french fries to go . I thought ok any $9 burrito must be fantastic and boy was I wrong. When I got home and open this beast up I could see the grease pouring out of the tortilla. When I bit into the burrito the slices of avocados were raw and harder than the onions and I had to spit them out. The carne asada was chewy and overcooked without any authentic flavor. I didn't even finish half the burrito . I love authentic Mexican food but this place is a dump and lacks any concerns about quality, my advice is stay away. I feel the gut churning already. Blahhhh
4;awesome people working there that really know their stuff. Great selection of guns. WE LOVE ARIZONA TACTICAL FIREARMS
3;Game on! My lady is a NOLA native. While beautiful and refined she loves the dirty south. And loves crawfish. She turned me on to them and now I am addicted too. Everytime we went down to NOLA - 5 pounds. Every time the LSU alumni association would have a boil we were there. So I surprised her with a visit to HJCrawfish and it did not disappoint... Was it as good as NOLA? No f-in way. But really close and good enough. \n\nThe service IS stellar. They are all family. It's all their brother's business and they treat customers right. Right now they are getting crawfish from Texas and we think that may be why they aren't as good as they could be. Our hopes are then when they are back in season the crawfish will once again be coming in from Louisianna and they'll be even better. \n\nGet the spicy - Good luck.
1;"Based on the other reviews, this show certainly has plenty of fans.  I'm guessing most of them didn't know what Cirque du Soleil is famous for, because Cirque du Soleil this show was not.\n\nCirque du Soleil is, first and foremost, a unique art form that provides jaw-dropping, unforgettable displays of physical human ability.  It's not just my opinion; their own website proclaims as much.  This incredible experience is what causes people to book pricey shows weeks in advance. \n\nBut there were almost none of the signature Cirque du Soleil acrobatics.  Instead there were lots and lots of interpretive dance moves, running around in elaborate costumes, nonsensical random artsy monologue and dialogue - and, oddly, grunting.  (At least three of us thought said grunting had an awkward racial tinge.)  As a result, the show felt less like Cirque and more like a live action re-enactment of the multi-media displays of Beatles' memorabilia that I'd seen recently, of all places, interspersed between gameplay in the video game Beatles Rock Band.\n\nThis version of \""Cirque du Soleil light\"" seemed to answer the question I had going in: how does one maintain the Cirque identity without upstaging the legendary Beatles?  Apparently the producers answer was \""We won't.\""\n\nWhile costumes, interpretive dance, and general weirdness are indeed part of Cirque du Soleil's identity, I don't think they're the parts that people come to shows for.  And based on the applause I heard, it seemed like I wasn't the only one in the audience that felt this way.  Not once was applause instantaneous, the way it is when a crowd is wowed by a performance.  And, to my own disappointment for the dutiful and energetic performers, not once was the applause prolonged beyond that required by courtesy.  In an earlier life, I spent a lot of time onstage myself, and weak ovations like this are heartbreaking, especially when the disappointment is not the fault of the performer.\n\nYet as I left the theater, I overheard at least four patrons (all women) remark on how much they loved the show.  It was unclear to me if this was genuine awe at the overall experience, a rekindled infatuation with the Beatles, denied guilt at having just paid $132 to watch a big music video with some interpretive dancers, or something else.  To some extent, I understood those who enjoyed the show. The Beatles songs I adore most - 'While my Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Hey Jude' among them - were the ones I remembered most fondly.  It suggested to me that those who thought they loved the show actually just loved the music.  The sound quality was impeccable, delivered through a massive custom audio setup including stereo in-seat speakers that made the Beatles' music come alive in a way even my higher end multi-speaker car stereo cannot.  When combined with the light show and special effects, it was often a better-than-average way to experience Beatles' recordings.\n\nBut the standard should be much higher than beating your car stereo.  To receive 5 stars, this show needs some changes: first, drop the \""Cirque du Soleil\"" branding.  Second, advertise it as an interpretive dance plus Beatles music multimedia show.  Third, lower the price by 3x to be cheaper than the Beatles Rock Band video game.  Finally, have the surviving Beatles make cameos.\n\nI imagine none of this will happen anytime soon.  In the meantime, Beatles fans, rest assured that Cirque du Soleil did not upstage the Beatles.  And Cirque du Soleil fans, make sure you get tickets to a different Cirque show."
1;The entrance to Pure was mobbed with people. We had made previous arrangements with a staff member to get our large party (14, mostly girls) inside. It was nearly impossible with the poor line control.\n\nWe finally made it inside but were quite disappointed. The primary downstairs area was extremely packed and too dark. The open air dance floor upstairs was much better.\n\nI don't want to sound snobby, but... the bouncers seem to let everyone. There were also quite a few extremely drunk individuals that I would have expected to be escorted out, if anyone had been paying attention.
3;Perfect for a local band, and the cajun fries aren't bad either. If there is a neon reverb band playing there, or another local band..you can always count on a good dive bar experience!
1;No more 99 cent beer, no more diarrhea inducing 99 cent shrimp cocktail, no more 1/4 lb hot dogs...dangit...whats a cheapskate to do?\nWell at least the Snack Nook has footlongs for $1.99
1;"5 Guys is an odd name, but whatever works for you.  This burger joint claims to be one of the best around the nation.  Just look at all the signs they post and how proud they are; granted I appreciate confidence.  Burgers here are mediocre - nothing to rave about and crave for during those sleepless nights.  Fries are my favorite since they're real chopped potatoes.  Atmosphere...what I can't hear you?  Yeah, I generally don't enjoy places where I have to debate whether to dance or eat :("
3;This place is great for furniture and clothes.  I always find the best kids clothes here, Janie & Jack, the Gap, Old Navy etc.  The prices are good and the store is clean (if not crowded).\n\nFurniture is hit and miss, but when its good its good.  HUGE selection of women's shoes.
3;"Doughnuts. Donuts. Dog Nuts...whatever you call them for the most part, they're all tasty. Well maybe not dog nuts. \n\nLets get real, this place is like a fried dough time machine and I love it. Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the \""Wonder Years\"" TV show. \n\nI originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \n\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \n\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called \""The Texas\"" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called \""The Alaskan\"", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?. I'm not sure, but sadly it didn't matter, \""The Texas\"" was sold out and \""the Alaskan\"" is made-to-order. Next time, my doughnut loving friends!"
0;"The food is good if they can get your order right. 2nd time in a row they have screwed up my take out dinner order. I even confirmed my order this time when picking up (ordered no spice) and the guy said medium spice, and I said \""no, it should be no spice\""  and he said \""yes, no spice.\"" Well, I take my food home and lo and behold, my food is spicy. Thanks for lying to my face dude. Makes me regret leaving a top."
0;DOG OWNER BEWARE!!!! Do Not take your dog here!!! We took our two dogs here and when we picked them up they were butchered!!! We have a Maltese and a Lhasa Apso, we asked for a teddy bear cut and not to cut my Lhasa's Goatee. We got them back and they were shaved down like a five year old had done it. My Lhasa looked like a giant rat! The lady was very rude. She is cheap, but you get what you pay for. DO NOT GO HERE. DOG OWNER BEWARE!!!
0;STAY AWAY!!! Keep your money in your pocket. \n\nThis is the WORSE place to get your manicure and pedicure. I paid over $40 for just the fill. The next day, my nails started splitting and water was getting in. They did not glue them. I also had a broken nail, which they charged extra to fix. Needless to say, that broke again. Yes,  the next day. I have been doing my nails for over 25 years and never experienced such a rip off place with techs who does such a lousy job. It isn't cheap either.
0;"No stars actually.  \n\nWe get to Ra to check out the happy hour and waited at the front for a while to get seated.  Then I said to my husband \""it's happy hour, we should just go to the bar area\"" so we did, found a small table with nothing on it.  Sat down - I was sort of annoyed that there was no hostess.  \n\n15 mins later a server comes over and asks if we were seated by the hostess - we said no and that we waited at the front for a while then decided to just sit down, and she said it wasn't a problem, she would get us menus and would be over in a min to get our order.  Sweet we think. \n\nNext the bitch of a hostess comes over with her stank attitude and literally threw my menu at me, to the point where my water almost knocked over, didn't apologize and barked at us \""you're not supposed to sit yourselves down, you're supposed to wait for me to seat you.\""  Do I look like I cared?  Come on, you work at a sushi place in the mall, not some 5-star Gary Denko joint.  Get over yourself. \n\nI was really annoyed.  Thank god our waitress was helpful and really nice, we left her a fat tip, hopefully she got it.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be back."
1;Oh Fireflys, despite of the heat this place has been getting I've always loved this place. But, now the quality of the food has    deteriorated as well as their customer base. Now I know the whole salmonella thing happened to the paradise location. You would think Fireflys would learn from it but than I hear the Eastern location closed down. The eastern location was the fanciest one! The building structure was ridiculous (the good kind). Than that leaves the Sahara location. People might thing I'm crazy to eat here again but I do enjoy their food until now. \n\nFriday nights are always usually super busy. We came in and it was pretty dead. Ordered the usuals that we usually get-- \n\nspicy beef salad (my fav)-- still taste amazing. Warm salads are always my fav. Add ginger in it for the kick & it's delicious. \n\nEmpanadas- really dry. The salad that comes with it had a sour dressing with it that didn't taste too familiar. \n\nCeviche- oh how this dish had change. Less less less. I remember they would bring a bowl with hella chips. Now it's 6 chips with palm full of ceviche. One of the worse ceviches I ever had. \n\nAlbondigas- the meatballs are smaller now. Tasted pretty good still but something was missing. I don't know what it is. \n\nCocktails & sangria -- pretty much the same no changes there. \n\nI used to be in love with this restaurant but I guess all good things must come to an end.. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Oh and if anyone's wondering.. I didn't get sick.
2;"Seems like with rotating changes to the foodie landscape in Cave Creek, there are always new places to replace the old ones going out of biz. Such is the case here. The bldg sat empty for a bit and then... like magic the Tap Haus appears. But...so far it just sort of a space filler on Cave Creek Rd.\n\nWhile the people are nice enough it's a mixed bag of good and \""so so\"" that is worth a trial period but doesn't bang me over the head to go back 2 or 3 times a week.  We've been there several times as it's not \""that bad\"" and even on New Year's Eve wound up there. Service has been adequate and the last time even extra good. Consistency is still the key to any food operation and they're still trying.\n\nFor the most part, the food is a 6-7. The pasta with Chipotle sauce was good and spicy, and enough to take home for another meal but the chicken was rubbery and not the grilled fantasy you might have craved. Even the nice sauce wasn't enough to mask it's chewiness. The Prime Rib on NYE was decently spiced but even an end cut shouldn't be dry and still have marks where the jockey was beating it.\n\nThe batter they use for many things is good but... 8 medium to small onion rings for 6 bucks seemed a bit pricey for this \""Road House turn Tap Haus\"". The one thing I keep hearing is that the music is good. They have a semi regular band and we might go and check that out this evening.\n\nThey've got a TV crowd as they have plenty to watch games and even Fox News, and you can sit around the lower bar with chairs which is good if you're prone to falling off high stools. Although from my experience so far, the drinks won't make you that tipsy. Let's face it, my drink of choice for 30 years+ has been the Long Island Ice Tea and I've had them from Hawaii to New York City, Vancouver to Miami. A good one should taste good not \""alcoholy\"", but if after two you can still recite the Greek alphabet backwards in four seconds.....? It's probably not made with everything it should be and for the prices they get for that drink, you should get your money's worth. They do have a few decent wines and it's almost impossible to screw up a 7 & 7.\n\nIf you want beer beer beer... then you might like running the gauntlet of tap after tap. I'm not a beer person so other than a nice Corona on a hot day near a beach, i could care less but there's plenty of choices (nearly 100?) if you have a spare afternoon. You're sure to find something there that meets your  \""hops and barley\"" expectations.\n\nSo.. for now.. 3 (really 2 1/2) stars, as the place has enough to bring in the people (maybe expectations are going down in CC) but we'll see how a couple more visits work out as this is convenient, small enough to be comfortable and with outdoor seating the lunch experience is relaxing. We'll see as we'd like to see this place make it and even replace other \""really bad experiences\"" on the Cave Creek culinary trail. Time will tell....More later."
4;A Fantastic Japanese restaurant we visited on a weekday night.\n\nWe started off with the side order of the beef and it was very delicious.\n\nI tried the Katana drink (so good!) and the Tokyo tea (Happy hour special) and they were very rewarding. Prepared well.\n\nOf course, we tried 4 sushi rolls. The crazy roll, the godzilla, spicy salmon, and Tequila. They were all finely prepared and brought out on one large plate. The presentation was great.\n\nThe service was fine. Only hiccup was the waiter didn't mention it was happy hour. However, he was very professional and positive. \n\nThe total bill was around 60, so it was definitely worth it.
4;Chef salad was delicious and quickly prepared. Great attitude from employees Order was perfect. Open till 10pm for late time dinner.
1;I just had lunch here with two friends. From start to finish it was two hours for lunch, I think this is unacceptable. We were seated right away and greeted pretty quickly. The server was pushing a glass of Shiraz on me which I agreed to. He also took the drink order for my two friends. We got the 3 wines 15 minutes later, and when i asked for bread he said it would come after the menus were gone but he still hadn't taken our order. I had the Cesar salad that had no flavor and the tomatoes were too ripe and very mushy. My friend had the tuna carpaccio which was good and had very nice presentation. \n\nThe entrees came after an hour and 20 minutes from when we sat. We had to ask three people about our food and we heard our waiter ask someone where it was also. I had the pasta special which was with chicken, mushrooms, peas on paradelle. It was very bad, all the flavors muddled together and the paradelle was thin and overcooked. The chicken was shredded which I've never had on a pasta with white wine sauce, I didn't even finish a third of it. My friends had sandwiches which were just fine. We had to split the check and the waiter made a big deal about it and said he had to talk to the manager. For what i detailed above at lunch, it was $150. \n\nI would never go back to this restaurant or any other Todd English restaurant.
0;"(...one-star for my girl who kept her cool when things went to sh*t...)\n\n*sigh*\n\nI used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.  \nBut the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.\n\nIll Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993)\n10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.\n\nThe Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004)\nSo, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, \""regrettably\"" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...\n\nBy All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988)\nAt this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with \""that guy\""... who told us to talk to \""this guy\""... who said to KT, \""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club\"".  Wow, really?\n\nStakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996)\nDuring the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.\n\nTougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988)\nSo, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.\n\nYeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO.\n_______________________________________\nBIG-UP BIG-UP BIG-UP!  Some of you guys were cool (clip-board guy with the faux-hawk and the Polynesian guys),for trying to do all you coulda/woulda for my girls/crew, thank you much anyway."
4;Her new salon is amazing!!! Check out her pictures...everything is so clean as always..I would suggest for now in the beginning to call in advance for early am appts. I'm sure as a new business its gotta be hard running 24hrs with out 24 hrs of consistent business! But Elaine is amazing and will accommodate I'm sure!!!  Lets help get her there she deserves it and we deserve the best service for our money which she delivers every time. I still stand by my five stars Elaine is amazing and know that even if Elaine cannot be the one to do your nails have faith in her judgement of employees she has high standards! AND.....while your there try the new mood changing gels holy cow im easily amused and I love my nails they are sooooo fun! Shes always up to date with all the new cool styles!
0;Called and asked if there was a wait for my wife and I to get spa pedicures. Lady avoided my question three times and assured me that I could get us in in 30 minutes. We get there and the place is packed. I asked again...is there a wait? Lady still avoids my question and sits us in the spa chair with our feet in the water. We sit...sit..sit..no one comes to start on us and my wife couldn't even pick out her color in advance. When we asked why we were waiting when I asked four times if there would be a wait, the lady said they're running behind. I said...uhh why didn't you just say that to begin with!? Why lie just to get us here!??? Avoid this place like the plague... Unethical business practices!!!
2;The waiter was attentive and helpful.  The omelet was good.  But holy fatoosh don't order the grape leaves.  Yikes...it had some sort of reddish goo spread over one of the pieces, almost like the others had it scraped off.  Took one bite and sent it back.  The decor was like a yellow mausoleum with small cubby holes surrounding the dining room, like a place for an urn of ashes.  I guess the food would be hit and miss.  Thank goodness the omelet was good.
0;"One of the best and worst Las Vegas Experiences iv had. Now getting a Michael Angelo Suit with a Pool Table for under $500 a night on a Labor day Weekend last minute sounds great right? Well listen to this story. \n\nWe Went to Las Vegas a day early innately staying at the MGM so we needed a room and they were all out we got recommended to this place by someone working at MGM. \n\nNow we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a MOTEL 8 from the outside. But we gave it a shot anyways. We walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought. We made friends fast with Jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms. The first room they gave us with there standard room which was small but nicely decorated that had a busted door so for security reasons we asked for a room change. Instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the Michael Angelo Suit. Honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a Orgy. But whatever we decided to make the best of it.\n\nThe girl who gave us the tour to the room mentioned that this hotel is NON-SMOKING but if u get the suit u can do whatever u want u can smoke there just crack open the window. Like a dumby we trusted her and smoked in the room to only find later  they hit ME with a $250 fee. The room was split between me and my cousin but i got hit with the fee. Then when i called them to ask for my money back they said they would give only half and i said fine. And then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do..There a bunch of let downs. \n\nMy advice is just stay away from this place its shady get a real room at a real place like Palazzo or MGM or Wynn were u can smoke at least and not get hit $250 for a cheep wanna be motel 8 turned into a \""LOCAL CRACK SPOT\"" hotel."

2;"Okay so the Forest Cafe is another place that has been reviewed a million times, but I feel I might still be able to offer some kind of valuable opinion.\n\nFirst off any faults I have with the Forest Cafe are nothing to do with it being vegetarian or vegan cafe. Again I feel like so many of the complaints about vegetarian places seem to confuse the fact that a place can be crap, like crap service and or crap cleanliness or crap food, regardless of it being vegetarian. In fact if the Forest Cafe did serve animal then its faults would be worse, for reasons we will come to. But for whats it's worth I don't agree with the fundamentalist view that  has been aired that animals were \""put on Earth\"" to be eaten by humans (and I think most scientists would agree). I appreciate it's vegetarian/vegan stance, if nothing else its one more place vegetarians can go without having to worry about what's in their food. And as I have alluded to in other reviews, I'm sure meat eaters can still appreciate the occasional meat free dish in principal. Thus I don't find the fact that the Forest is vegetarian/vegan in itself to be a valid criticism (and suggesting vegetarianism is synonymous with hippyism is also ridiculous).\n\nANYWAY if you hadn't guessed from my ramblings already the Forest is a vegetarian cafe, as well as a meeting spot and venue. It's also volunteer run. As others have mentioned there is a sort of  \""hippy\"", New Age aesthetic, although both those words are pretty meaningless.\n\nSo what are my problems with the Forest? My first is hygiene. Whilst the food can be just fine, and it's cheap too, the number of times I have been served dishes that have been lying out for too long, or the tables haven't been wiped in a long while. Can you see my point about meat now? The toilets have also been less than appealing on certain occasions in the past.\n\nThese are the sorts of things that bother me. I love that the Forest is volunteer run, I love that it's very liberal and relaxed about most, but those things need not be synonymous with disorganisation and uncleanliness. If anything that just furthers a stereotype that pervades some of these other reviews. My only other complaint is that whilst the Forest can be, as I have mentioned, a wonderfully open and easy going place where anyone can voice their opinion, it can contradictorily be a bit cliquey. I have found that some nights, during discussions and meetings, there are certain well known individuals who drown out and mock dissenting voices. It is the New Age eco dogmatic view in particular which seems to prevail without as much criticism as its deserves. Having said this, the Forest remains largely unhierarchal. And at how many other cafes can you even attend meeting and voice such opinions on how they are run in the first place?\n\nThe one thing I love and respect about the Forest is that you can go in and spend as much time as you like in there without buying a thing. How many places let you do that? I was recently thrown out of a pub after fifteen minutes of not buying anything while I was waiting for someone, and I was one of only three people in there! I like the Forest's stance on just being a place to \""hang\"" if you so choose.\n\nSo whilst the Forest has so many great things going for it, there is room for improvement. Those anarchists and communitarians that use the Forest as a meeting place, should especially mind their own proclamations of unhierarchal social organisation, and its compatibility with order and effectiveness. The Forest needs to be a little more ordered and effective!"
2;This was fun. Got a little board at times.
0;"Decided to stay here for the 4th of July because we have a toddler now and just thought it would be more appropriate. We haven't been to vegas since our wedding in 2006. Vegas has changed a lot, but the hotel has not. There were pubic hairs and other \""things\"" on our bathroom floor and counter. The rest of the room looked as though it doesn't ever get vacuumed, or cleaned period!  If we could have left and got our money back we would have. When we checked in there was no parking available and I mean none, no valet, no self parking, etc....  Unbelievable!!! We will definitely never being staying here again. I just thought this place would cater to kids and be more child friendly, but instead I have to worry about what he's touching every second!!' Nasty!!"
1;I purchased a Hollywood Blvd cupcake as well as a Savannah Street treat.  The Hollywood Blvd cake tasted like it was purchased at my local Vons - not that that is a bad thing, but if I am purchasing cupcakes from a cupcake shoppe, I have higher expectations.  The frosting was extremely sugary - sort of like you want to barf after eating it.  The cake was moist but its flavor was overpowered by the frosting.\n\nThe Savannah Street cupcake was very blah.  The cake had a sort of waxy taste to it and the frosting flavor was much too weak.\n\nI was glad I had the opportunity to sample, but I will not be driving down Cupcake Lane any time soon.
0;If I could rate them 0 I would. I am still sitting on the side of the road waiting for them to arrive I called 3 hours ago and they said 75 minutes and they still are not here. Last I checked 75 minutes was 1 hour and 15 minutes. After reading all the reviews it's clear this company does not care about their reputation. I have say in the Arizona heat for 3 hours because of their lack of professionalism.  Do not use this company at all seriously call someone else. I just called another company because it's been 3.5 hours and I haven't even gotten an update or courtesy call. The other company said 1.5 hours give or take 15 minutes let's see who shows up first. I will update with answer soon\n\nCentral showed up after 4hours, I did cancel the other tow cause I'm not rude, but I will never use central towing again because they were not remotely close to the time promised even 30 min late would have been forgivable but 2 hours 45 min late in 100 degree weather is unacceptable. Then offering no discount or anything stay away
4;OK so another winner in this neighborhood besides Nicky's.  The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.  Katie our server was professional AND personable and only added to our outstanding meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with.   WOW what a place.  The only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  Well worth the trip!
1;Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nYup, I don't think this is a 5-star hotel. I was unimpressed, and here's why:\n\n1) Took almost an hour to check-in. \n\n2) Requested a non-smoking room, but instead received a smoking room (11th floor) when the front desk told me they the non-smoking rooms were all unavailable. After leaving the lobby, I spoke with my co-worker, who waited behind me in line to check-in that went to another front desk representative, actually received a non-smoking room (30th floor). My front desk representative did offer me that they would switch me to a non-smoking room the next day because Housekeeping clean the room around the clock, and that they would leave me a message on my room phone with the new room # the next morning and I can just pack up my belongings and move effortlessly. That never happen.  \n \n3) I saw a bug crawled up on the left side of the bedsheet the first night I was there. Eek.\n \n4) Two lamps in my room did not work.\n\nI completed an online survey shortly after my stay (in March '13), and let the Guest Relations personnel know of my experience. They've offered me an upgrade to a Corner Suite. \n\nHow thoughtful of them. It would work if I decide to stay with them in the future. However, I really don't see myself returning to Aria. It's just not my cup of tea.
3;Wow...Ice cream benihanas! Ice cream made before your eyes on a ice pan. End result was great tasting fresh ice cream. Great Experience...take the kids and enjoy!
3;"I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\""s just an okay place with good food"
1;I heard many good things about this place and so was excited to try it out.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the Thai Beef Salad, Asian Chicken Salad, Monsters Meatball and Spaghetti, and Grilled Salmon. We were extremely disappointed. I don't even know what the meatballs tasted like. The spaghetti and salad dressings were BAD. The rice was hard. The salmon was a-ok, but the portion was small compared to other dishes.\n\nOn the bright side, I tried their famous frozen hot chocolate, and I loved it! We all loved it! Totally made my experience better. \n\nI don't know if we didn't order the right food, but I'm definitely not coming back here for their food, ONLY FOR DESSERT!
1;The prices are great but the wait is CRAZY just for picking up birth control that I called in on Monday it has taken me more than an hour. I finally got called but they can't find my pills I ordered four days ago.. Now I'm still waiting and I'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me. I should have known.. The first time I came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment.. That's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wIt time! :( the only person that could finally help me was Adrianna! Thank you!
3;Holy smokes crazy tea place you are crazy. it would have been a 5, but i got 'guilted' out of getting coffee when i was told I was ordering the last cup (after i relented, someone else just ordered after me). granted, it was Christmas Eve and people the employees wanted to go home.\n\nThe excitement about this place is evident from my mom's enthusiasm about the place as a tea expert. In the tea arena, i have seen no equal. The mustached tea guru who works there literally puts together the different teas - and has an intimate knowledge of each.
1;I went to lunch here today and ordered a barn burger with crispy zucchini.  The burger was luke warm and seemed like it was sitting there for a while.  The cheese was not melted.  Towards the end, I could not eat the burger.  The zucchini was hot and fresh but there was no seasoning on it and it tasted very bland.  The onion rings were freshly fried but had the same bland batter.\n\nThe staff was very nice and friendly.  The food came out fast and the restaurant was very clean.
0;"I would never reccommend this location to anyone. First I had to wait ten minutes to get to order my food. When I get up I start my order then he went silent said \"" im sorry what was that again\"" so i went over half the order and he never replied back I said hello and no reply about 4 mins later he wants me to announce my order again. ONE CAR WAS IN FRONT OF ME. place was not busy, I worked in the food service for 5 years thru college and never had something like this happen at my places. if it did i would have been fired. after i make the order and get to the window 15 mins after i decided to go here and not wendys next door, he tells the only car infront of me to pull forward. well he only pulled so far forward or he would be in oncoming traffic but yet it wasnt far enough for my 4 door car to get out and around. when i told the guy that took my order i didnt have time to wait 20 more mins and how long would my food take before i paid him he said should be ready in 5 mins. 20 mins later the guy in front of me gets out of his car walks in and takes  1 bag of food, at the same time i turned and this guy gave me my food. so for about 35 mins took me for a order of two combos and they call it fast food. The guy didnt even address the situation just said sorry for the delay. I wrote churchs chicken website and never heard back. I also called and they said the manager was not there he would call me back. never heard back. horrible store dont go !! with that service they will have to shut down unless they revamp the staff.  worst experience in my life!!!"
1;"This is the absolute, bar none, sweetest pizza ever. By sweet I mean sugary. The sauce is ridiculous. And I could tolerate it if it was the natural sweetness of tomatoes; it is not. They dumped an obscene amount of sugar in there. I couldn't even taste the cheese or the vegetables on the pizza. The only savory taste came from the meatballs, which were not that great. I also had their cheesecake. Not horrible, with a nice cheese tang, but again ungodly sweet for cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake. It came with a strawberry \""topping\"", and that is used loosely. This had to be the worst topping/jam I have ever eaten. Nothing but sugar, and no fruit taste."
1;"When I walked in and saw the person at the front desk on a personal call, I knew I should have turned around and left. She did not end the call while I stood there. There was no one else in the waiting room. If I was feeling better I would have found some place else to go. \nShe finally finishes her call and acknowledges me. I complete the required paperwork. I go to bring it to her and she is on another call with a patient. She saw me walk up with my paperwork and place it on the counter in front of her. Another person walks in, she ends her call and proceeds to help the next person, after taking all her info she stands up and says to me \""why didn't you tell me you completed your paperwork\"". I did not even answer her as I knew I would have been rude. She calls me up, tells me I have to pay completes the transaction. I sit back down. The lady from back calls me back. Asks what is wrong, asks about medicines I am taking and my history. I am telling her everything, and she keeps asking me how do you spell it. Everything I said she could not spell. OK, I know medicines and diagnosis are not easy to spell but seriously, I was getting pretty annoyed at this. Plus all the while she is sniffling, I was already sick and the last thing I need is for it to get worse. \nThe Doctor came in a few minutes later, and says hello and says you have the flu. Alrighty then, I could have told her that myself. that is why I have not gone anywhere till today. She finally says well let me take a look, we are talking about my headaches, she says well I can't diagnosis headaches, you should to to the ER for a cat scan. That was it for me. A cat scan for the flu. She tells me to rest for two more days she will give me a note for my employer. Pick up the note up front. I get back to the front ask for my note. My favorite receptionists says we only give those if you ask. I reply the Doctor told me to come get it, not the other way around. I honestly could not take another minute of this so called urgent care. I said i do not need the note and left. I do not need the note. I do not call in to work, so I am not worried. \nThe bottom line is this place is a sham for an urgent care. If you are ill, honestly go to your own Dr. if you can, Even quick care is better than this. \nI give it two stars because my crankiness may be playing a part in how I am writing this. I am trying to be fair., by taking into consideration I do not feel well."
1;I called toward the end of the night so I'm not really surprised that the lady that picked up seemed a bit passive-aggressive when I told her I wasn't ready to order and was just asking how late they were open. I called a few minutes later and they told me that it would take an hour since the driver would be taking the pizza on his way home. The driver was a nice, older gentleman. When he called, for some reason my phone didn't register it, so he texted me, and that was nice. I apologised for that and he said he didn't mind.\nTheir pizza smelled fantastic and would probably be great if it were just cheese, but the one we ordered had pineapple only as the topping, and the savoury flavours didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the pineapple. It was also weird because the pizza smelt heavily of garlic, yet it was nowhere to be tasted. The cheese had a good texture that was chewy in a positive way- not to soft, or too tough- and their crust smelled good but tasted pretty generically bland. We had been really excited to try it because of the smell, so it's unfortunate that it didn't turn out so well.
3;"Summerlin's newest restaurant - Sea Stone, has replaced Hannah's!  \n\nYesterday's red carpeted grand opening gave me the chance to sample their food and wine menu.  It appears they kept the original inside dcor and the running water above and below creates a serene atmosphere.\n\nDescribing their food as 'sushi & gourmet fusion', you see a range of Asian techniques in their cooking.  \n\n* Boca Park Roll (Deep fried yellowtail topped with spicy tuna and scallions, served with eel sauce and spicy aioli.) - My favorite of those offered - eat it while it's hot!\n\n* Cucumber Wrap (A riceless sushi adventure with tuna, salmon, albacore, crab, avocado, and kaiware wrapped with cucumber.) - It's refreshing and light, and a nice contrast against other rolls with heavy sauces.\n\n* 9th Isle (Spicy tuna roll with spicy shrimp tempura, cucumber and kaiware sprouts served with sweet glazed unagi.) - Eel lovers and those scared off by the raw will enjoy this roll.\n\n* TNT (California roll topped with baked rock shrimp, shitake mushroom, and scallop with creamy aioli and sweet onion sauce.) - The mushroom topping dominates.\n\n* Baja Roll (California roll topped with marinated tuna, tomato, flying fish roe and green onion.) - One again, the toppings are coming off, but refreshing with the tomatoes.\n\n* Sea Stone Rainbow (A riceless sushi delight made with ahi tuna, salmon, snapper, and crab mix, rolled in soybean paper and served with balsamic-mango reduction.) - Reminds me of a spring roll and enjoyable for those watching their carb intake.\n\nDim sum offerings included the shrimp puff, which came with a mayo dipping sauce.  It was loaded with shrimp and yummy when eaten hot.  I also tried the steamed pork and vegetable purse, aka siu mai or pork dumpling.  These were standard with other dim sum restaurants.\n\nOne of my favorites was the Peanut Crusted Hibachi Satays (Grilled chicken thighs with cilantro, Fresno chiles, lemongrass, coconut, and soy peanut vinaigrette.).  It was full of flavor and the sauce was delicious!  The Beef Negimayaki (Tender and juicy teriyaki beef skewers with scallion kimchi filling, garlic and a light tomato relish.) was okay, the beef was rolled around the scallion and skewered, didn't taste as exception as it sounded.  The Stuffed Ahi Carpaccio (Thinly sliced ahi rolled around crab ceviche with jalapeno, salsa, baby greens and a ponzu glaze.) had a bit of caviar on top that made it decadent.\n\nA nice twist was the Haricot Vert & Asparagus Salad (Tomato concassee, frisee, chevre cheese and glazed walnuts with mustard vinaigrette.) which can be heavy with the goat cheese.  The nuts provide a sweet and crunchy texture to the softness of the cheese.\n\nOf the entre samples, my favorite was the Baked Miso Yaki Butterfish (Shiro miso, sake, mirin and ginger, served with braised coconut rice.).  The fish was soft and silky and the rice was like butter, so good!  The Grilled Black Angus Strip (Roasted garlic herb butter, served with cured tomatoes and roasted sweet potatoes.) wasn't as tender as I had hoped, but the potatoes were a lovely treat!  I heard great things about the Potato-Crusted Salmon (Served with stir-fried vegetables and a ginger lime butter sauce.), but it didn't live up to the excitement.  The potatoes were shoe-string and would come off in one piece and the salmon was standard.  The stir-fried veggies were julienne-cut, so the flavors were muddled together.  The Braised Tofu with Spicy Tomato Black Bean Sauce (Soft tofu coated in potato starch and fried in vegetable oil, braised in vegetable stock, soy and chili sauce and served with tomato concassee and black beans.) is typical of what I find at Chinese restaurants.  However, the tomato added a slight contrast that made it unique and possibly, a vegetarian's dream.  \n\nWith all the heavy eating, I was pleased with their dessert offerings.  They had two sweets to choose from - the Chocolate Zen and the White Chocolate Bliss.  I preferred the chocolate with its flourless, ganache-glazed dark chocolate cake over the white chocolate and coconut sponge cake.\n\nNot only did Sea Stone go all out on the food, they provided ample wine and sake tasting.  They had an extensive wine list, but their sake list is what kept me happy.  Not only do they offer traditional sake, but those who enjoy the sweeter side of life will enjoy Hana's fruit-based ones (Fuji Apple, Raspberry, and Lychee) and the Star Rabbit \""Blueberry Infused\"" sparkling sake.  I'm a big fan of the sweet stuff, but the new discovery of the blueberry sparkling one was a fab find!\n\nOverall, Sea Stone is another Asian fusion restaurant in the Vegas scene.  Their market is different being off strip though and based in Boca Park.  They have a nice outdoor lounge area that would be great for after work dinner drinks and eats.  They offer some typical Asian fare and sushi, and some unique concoctions as well.  I'd be back to sample their other creative inventions."
4;I would never go anywhere else in the area, I have tried the one by Fry's, Safeway, and on Grand.. None of them are as nice and knowledgable as this group of people. Great job Do My Nails!  Almost forgot their new spa chairs, amazing to say the least.
2;Today is Administrative Assistant's Day, YAY, so our school's parent club took us all out to lunch here.  There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.\n\nThe chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.\n\nI ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty decent experience.  The food was fine, the company was fun, and the service was pretty damn good considering our large numbers and needy ladies.
4;This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out.
4;Had the fried shallot salmon roll, awesome! Very fair prices and a nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong.
4;We were very excited when this place opened! We really have never had a terrible experience. Our last experience was the first time the we just did not enjoy our food. Our server Lindsey was very nice and she noticed that we were not really eating and offered to grab us something else. We declined but the manager James came over and insisted they get us something else to make up for it not being to our taste. Then who I believe was the cook came out and just said, if you guys want some dessert, let us know and it will be on us! They were really fantastic with trying to make sure we were happy. We did not end up having dessert because we were full but the gesture was very nice. One of the bartenders who was getting off of his shift even came over and said hi to us because he recognized us from coming in a few times before. When it comes to the food, the Pretzel with Beer Cheese is the best! Make sure it is soft though! The beer selection is great and the knowledge is pretty good when it comes to the servers. If they don't know, they always suggest you try it which is awesome because you can try until you find something you really like! Great job guys!
0;"I had lunch today, and my instincts were right when I first walked in through the door. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to my instincts. 1. The two waiters were dressed in street clothing, and didn't speak a word of ENG. 2. I asked for a mango lassi and got  \""nothing served through the course of my meal.\"" 3. The tables had spoons and knives, but no forks. I think by now, I should have walked out the door, but wanted to try this place. Gee, what is wrong with me? \n\nThe food was tasteless, no salt, not flavor and diluted curries. by this I mean, additional water was added to the sauces and this process diluted the curries!!!! ( Wow!, cost control and quality control is definitely not part of their vocabulary here).The temp. was lukewarm and the quality of ingredients used were extremely poor. This is the first time I have ever had a bad meal at an Indian Restaurant, in the 20 yrs. tasting Las Vegas! PLEASE do not visit this place or you will end up with hear burn all day long, like I have. It's 11pm now and I am still feeling sick from my 1pm luncheon. Unless you have an enemy in your contact list, send them there. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE, even your worst enemy!"
0;Me and my girlfriend went here on our date night, since its less than a mile from our place! We got seated pretty fast, but it went downhill from there. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen, and at least 3 employees passed us by without saying a word. We were hungry and thirsty but after 10 minutes of waiting, we decided that they didn't need our business and we left! Very disappointed!! Luckily there is a Garcias right down the street, and we had excellent service as usual.. Don't waste your valuable time on La Fonda's
1;The place is mainly eh. The sashimi tastes like its B quality from the supermarket. Go to Red or Unami instead.
2;Nove was an interesting Italian place.  At the top of the Palms, I was expecting a bit more for the price.  Our meal was very expensive and unfortunately, I did not like what I ordered.  The server said the Seafood Spaghetti was their signature dish and honestly, I would be embarrassed if this were my restaurants signature dish.  Nove was a decent experience but I will probably not return.  I really wanted to love this place, but I just didn't.
3;A friend and I came here to grab lunch during our stay in Montreal and I was really pleased with the selection of ready made foods they had for us to choose from.\n\nThe staff here was very friendly, and I spent less than $15 for food that would have cost twice that in New Orleans.\n\nI left with pineapple chicken, egg roll, macaroni salad, two boxes of cookies, and some other items I can't recall at the moment and they were all delicious.  \n\nI was pleased with our choices, I would recommend stopping in if you are in a rush and want a lot of options for lunch!
0;I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)
4;I was on my way back to Cali from Vegas one late Sunday night when my car broke down by the Primm Valley Resort and Casino. Turned out my alternator needed to be replaced. I had no choice but to call out from work the next day and get it fixed. I did not know of any auto shops around the area and there was no way I was gonna tow my car back to Cali. I decided to yelp auto shops and this was the first one that came up. I called first thing in the morning and a woman by the name Mary picked up the phone.(Turns out she is one of the owners) She was awesome and very helpful from the start! I explained my situation and told her I needed to get back to Cali that same day. She told me to just bring the car in and they will have it taken care of right away. I got my car towed into the shop and the moment I walked in, there was Mary at the front desk. I could tell it was her by the sound of her voice and how sweet and polite she was. She started working on things right away and even introduce me to the mechanic that would be working on my car. I've never gotten service like that! Anyways, to make a long story short, I found out I had a warranty on my alternator (I had gotten it replaced over a year ago and bought the part from Autozone). The mechanic then went out of his way and went to the local Autozone to have the part replaced! They could have  just left that work up to me or could have just charged me to replace it with their own parts but they didn't. They went above and beyond with their service! I was very pleased with the service that was provided!!    Everything was taken care of like she said. I definitely recommend this place! I wasn't ripped off like other places. You can definitely trust this place. :) Thanks Mary!
2;I love the concept of this place, but at $9 for an adult admission I'm disappointed in the number of items and selection that were on collection in the galleries. \n\nHowever, if you want to support the preservation of black art this is a great place to spend an hour in.
4;"WOW!! WOW!! \nFantastic show...you ask yourself all the time \""how'd they do that?\""....\nreally enjoyed it...\ntip...don't see too far forward...a lot of action is up high...go for the middle"
1;"Went in as a walk in for a pedicure and acrylic fill in.  The staff was nice and the place is clean. Buttttttt I've definitely had better pedicures. The fill in and shape up on my nails was great but the paint job was too thick. I guess the polish was old in which case they should've used a new one on me. Long story short, my nails weren't dry after they said \""yes you're dry we used a fast dry topcoat\"" and they all smudged. I just politely asked them to remove them all. I was over it."
3;I love Wendy's very much but the only reason they got 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes in the evening the window cashier is very rude and even yells at you through the box when you're ordering your food... Look people I get it you're working fast food but if you don't like the job, don't get the job... That is all!
2;Breakfast buffet was decent. Food quality was average and so was service.
1;"The airport is in need of an update.  It is very lack luster, there are very few healthy options for food (although this is common for airports) and there are still random Oxygen bars (do people still use these?).  The bathrooms are pretty dirty.  They have some corporate sponsored \""charging stations\"" but they are typically crowded and you can see people up and down the terminals either sitting on the floor or hustling to grab spots when they open.  Unless you are coming to or leaving LV, there are much better spots to have to lay over."
4;"Whenever I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to stop by CASA FUENTE. A mojito and one of the house blend torpedos. Sitting in the patio watching Sportscenter on one of the TVs. Nice way to spend an afternoon. The nights are pretty cool too. Especially during the weekend of the BIG SMOKE in November. The prices are not cheap, but, IT\""S VEGAS BABY!!!!"
3;It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.
4;Iron-man for sure. Thanks Tony for an amazing job and dealing with a difficult customer. My husband finally found his Barber! Truly an amazing cut and experience. Great location and shop.  You rock in the Mohawk dept.
2;"Rubio's gives me hope for fast food. \n\nMaybe it's the grass roof seating area inside (see photo), but the food is very good and it's not so cookie cutter predictable here. \n\nWe first started coming here after leaving the northwest.  Mostly because it reminded me of another great seafood place: \""Taco Del Mar\"".  I much prefer seafood, while the family enjoys beef and chicken.  The prices here are closer to Chipotle, than Toxic Hell (aka, Taco Bell).\n\nI love their original Fish Taco and it's only $1.49 on Tuesdays after 2:30.  Normally it goes for $2.79, so it's a great deal.  Another favorite is their Veggie Burrito, which is more flavorful than Chipotle and priced at the same $6.49.  But here it's a better deal because they includes chips.  Their large side of beans is also a good deal for only $1.49.  They also have a good selection of beer.\n\nRubio's is not perfect and sometimes the fish can be dry.  But most of the time, it's really very good.  The folks who work here are also great.  Mark behind the counter particularly makes you feel welcome and is good at sharing stories.  Oscar the Manager keeps the place very clean and the Salsa Bar is always immaculate (see photo).  Another plus!\n\nHere are their posted \""Fresh Rule\"" as you come in:\n1) Flavor comes FIRST; \n2) We never start your meal without YOU; \n3) Our chips, salsa and Guacamole are made FRESH; \n4) Our signature black & pinto beans are NEVER refried; \n5) We use NO lard or MSQ ever!\n\nWorks for me!\n\nThe only weakness, which is really not their fault, is the location. Rubio's is sandwich between an AT&T store and the Skeptical Chymist pub.  It has virtually no parking and because of those other two places the parking lot can be a mess at times.  I find 2:30-3:00 works best for a late lunch.\n\nThree and Half Stars Plus, or \""A-OK\"" bordering on Four.\n\nEnjoy!"
0;"Well, we have canceled our membership.  Their system was damaging our car.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which step was doing it, but a piece of trim that runs near the edge of the roof was pulled up and bent over after the last time we ran through their wash.  I don't think it was the heavy cloth strips they drag across the car because those would have been more likely to push it back down rather than peel it up.\n\nBut, whatever.  Never had this happen before, and not going to chance it again.  Of course they take no responsibility (no car wash does, to be fair).  I think \""touchless\"" is the only way to go.  And this place ain't touchless."
4;I called VERY last minute to ask for a special order on a cake for my mom's birthday cake and the very sweet woman who answered made it happen for me! Not only was she able to put everything I wanted on it, but she made it fresh and had it ready in only a few hours. When I went in to pick it up, it looked exactly how I had imagined. Since I was there I picked up a few cupcakes for one of my employees birthdays and the girls said that they were AMAZING! I will definitely be going back to this gem. I wasn't disappointed at all!
1;OK so I love a bobbie, i'll repeat I love a bobbie and I am a sucker for turkey day leftovers.  That being said I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for that one sandwich.  Their bread is dry, the prices are kind of expensive and the service in any of the caps I have ever been to isn't anything spectacular (I have been to this one the most).  I guess the cap pastrami is OK too but their cold subs are tasteless, just horrible, and this is usually my favorite type of sandwich especially on a hot summer day. I recently got a small turkey sandwich with all the fixings and I ate half of it and I just gave up on it, it might have been the worst turkey sandwich I have ever had in my like and I am not fooling. The bread is the most important part of a sandwich and that is the number one thing caps is lacking, also their toppings on cold subs are plain so the whole thing comes over as boring filler.
1;I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about.
4;Patrick Hassett is one great person to work with. He is always available to answer my questions and he saved me a ton of money over my previous insurance company. Do yourself a favor and have Patrick give you a quote.
1;Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.  As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion.
3;Ambience is lacking inside and out  ... I pulled up in a cab to a deserted looking mall and wondered whether I wanted to keep my lunch reservation ... I'm glad I did.\n\nI had the black pepper garlic chicken wings.  They were not greasy, yet crispy and flavorful.  I loved the salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub they put on the wings prior to frying.\n\nThe pork fried rice was initially just okay -- but after doctoring it up, it was great.  They initiallly got my order wrong, but even on the second try it was lacking in flavor so I asked for some of the spice rub for the wings and I mixed it in along with some of the thai bird chili and fish sauce (from the chili cart you need to ask for).  Pork is cut into  larger, thinish squares ... I prefer thicker and longer slices (typically a bit moister).\n\nService was prompt and friendly.
0;"I typically rate places based on food and food alone. However this is an exception and will explain why.\n\nMy husband and his friends stopped here (at my recommendation and others) for lunch and enjoyed delishly prepared and priced food. The group walked out the door when my husband realized he left his phone on the table.\n\nHe turned back around (maybe 1 minutes time passed) went to the table where it was being cleaned and asked the waiter did someone see my phone it was right there. To which the guy replied \""no\"" and kept \""working\""\n\nAnnoyed and confused the group returned to the hotel by cab. I decided to whip out my phone and locate his.\n\nLow and behold we look at the iphone locator only to find that the iphone (30 min later) was in a car in the employee parking lot behind the restuarant. We were mid-tanning so we figured we'd head over there in the next hour. An hour later it was still thre so they try and hail a cab and locate the phone only to see it moving- in the car that the EMPLOYEE---\n\n\n\nEat at your own risk- keep your phones hidden these employees have no common courtesy."
4;Come hungry! Leave happy! Awesome place never seen like this fine sushi restaurant!!!
0;"ZERO STARS ***DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT/ DEBIT CARD***\nIn Feb. a guy came to my car and said there was a special for $6.95 for a full month. I asked, \""What's the catch?\"" He said there wasn't one. I should have known....\n\nThese people started charging my card $16.95 every month there after. When I called, 623.925.8090, it goes straight to voicemail, I left two messages a week for 6 weeks to no avail. So I hunted around and found the fax number and sent them a fax requesting a refund and stop charging my card.\n\nI was contacted by Rebecca who said she would give me a refund for one month and anything else would be via gift card. I explained that I do not want their services and again asked for a refund as I did my due diligence and more and also have not used their services so a gift card is unacceptable. She charged that her manager had to talk to me, I agreed. She then said manager is in a \""meeting\"". I asked how long and she replied, \""All day\"" I asked when I should expect a return call and she said today or tomorrow. Well, that ofcourse tomorrow came. I gave them two days after that and I began calling the number that Rebecca had called me from and ofcourse they refused to take my calls. After another month of being dodged, low and behold my card is charged $16.95 again.\n\nI called again and this time first thing in the morning. A rude, heavy accented, charleton named Yessinia took my call. She sure was a peach. She specifically said, \""We will not refund or stop charging your card!\"" I asked her to repeat herself for clarity and then told her she was being recorded. She got very angry and told me to go to my bank. She went on to tell me she would make a note on my account to keep charging my card and specifically said they would lie to the bank and say I used their service. I was so shocked. I am so glad for low level, uneducated, girls who think they can be rude and steal hard working people's money for services NOT RENDERED! Once I learned this company is a scam I started taking precautions. I recorded you Yessinia. You said all of that on tape and I will give it to my bank! DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD AT SUPERSTAR CARWASH. They are theives!"
3;"About five years ago I took my vehicle to Auto Body World, at the dealership's recommendation, for some extensive body work caused by a house fire.  \n\nI was so pleased with the work they had done and impressed by the fact that they warranty their work for as long as you own the vehicle, that when I was involved in a traffic altercation a couple of months ago (thanks to the genius who side-swiped me), I opted to take my car back to ABW.\n\nThe whole process is pretty smooth.  You turn in your car, they deal with the insurance companies, they call you to pick up the car, you inspect it, pay your deductible, and go.\n\nThis time, they didn't do a bad job, per se, but they didn't live up to the expectations they had instilled in me from my previous experience with them.  \n\nFor example, the first time they worked on my vehicle, it had to be towed to their facility (as it was a melted glob of goo) and took about four weeks to repair.  This time, all I needed was a door repair and a bumper and quarter panel replaced and they quoted me 3.5 weeks.  \n\nNow, at this time, the other driver's insurance company wasn't contacting me or returning the calls my insurance adjustor was placing to them, so I was having to pay out-of-pocket for the car rental (the portion my carrier wouldn't cover), and of course, Enterprise had just jacked up their rates to take advantage of the snowbirds or spring training followers or whatever, so there was no way I was gonna pay for a rental car for nearly a month!  After some back and forth, it was revealed that the car would probably be ready within two weeks.\n\nFor the most part, I was satisfied with the work they did on my vehicle.  However, where they had repaired my door (instead of replacing it), I noticed there was a gap that was disproportionate to the gap on the other side of the SUV.  I was probably being nitpicky, but I noticed it, and I didn't appreciate the employee telling me, rather condescendingly, that they had no idea what I was talking about.  I would rather they have said, \""Yes, Ms. *insert name here*, I see what you're talking about, but in cases where car doors are repaired and not replaced, our technicians cannot always guarantee symmetry...\"" or something along those lines.  I'd be more accomadating if I wasn't spoken to like I was an idiot.  \n\nAlso, upon inspecting the vehicle, I noticed pitting in the paint job.  The employee was, like, \""Oh, that's no big deal, I can just take that back and have them buff that out...\""  It's, like, if it's \""no big deal,\"" then why didn't you have that done before you delivered the car?  It makes me wonder if there aren't other things you're trying to slip by me, y'know?\n\nSpeaking of trying to slip one by... while I was waiting for my car to be \""buffed,\"" I was looking over the invoice.  Admittedly, I didn't understand one word written on there (other than my own name), but I did see a $100.00 charge for towing.  I couldn't understand how that charge was implemented seeing as how I drove my car to their facility, this time.  When the employee returned with my vehicle, I asked about this charge, \""What is this $100.00 for towing?\""\n\n\""That was for towing the vehicle,\"" they said, again, with an air of condescension.\n\n\""No shi... kidding,\"" I responded.\n\n*silence and staring*\n\n\""Why is it on my bill?\"" I asked.\n\n\""Because you had the car towed,\"" they stated.\n\n\""No, I didn't,\"" I defended.\n\n\""Are you sure?\"" They asked.\n\n\""I'm more sure that I didn't have this vehicle towed than I am that you're trying to rip me off for $100.00,\"" I heard this statement escape my lips on its own.\n\nSo, after \""researching\"" the questionable charge, it was revealed that another employee accidentally added their towing charge to my ticket.  I don't know that I necessarily believe that, but since I can't prove otherwise, I'll go ahead and take that statement at face value.\n\nI'm giving this place four stars because I'm averaging my first five-star experience with my most recent three-star ordeal."
4;Amazing customer service. These guys know what they are doing. I would give them 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend.
0;These cupcakes are extremely nasty. They taste like they are made from a box mix. I can buy 4 boxes of mix for the cost of 1 cupcake. Me thinks not. The cake is extremely dry and the icing is overly sweet, in my opinion. There are other cupcake places in town that are miles better than this one is. \nI wouldnt recommend this place to a person without a tongue.
0;This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.
0;"This Salvation Army definitely has its fans. I've known people that would salivate at the idea of a Saturday afternoon spent digging through this store. You can, occasionally, find some good stuff here, but it takes a lot of digging and perseverance, and I find the price point to be way past my thrift flinch point, usually. \n\nThere are two levels. The lower level is furniture, housewares, linens, books, and toys. Basically, everything they carry besides clothing. The organization here on this level is..... well, \""organization\"" is such a strong word. Let's just say that the sections are free spirits that are not limited by arbitrary\""categories\"" for your ease. Most everything is pretty dirty. You can find ebay-worthy stuff sometimes, but I just don't ever feel like it's worth my time. \n\nUpstairs, you will find a cram-packed clothing section. Men's, Women's, Children's, purses, jackets, coats and shoes stuff each rack to the bursting point and then there are the wall displays -- \""selected items\"" are hung on nails, all the way up to the ceiling. Yes, you have to ask for help to get stuff down. \n\nThere's a decent mix of old and newer stuff, but I rarely, rarely find things I want to buy. I think a lot of the merch is overpicked regularly by some savvy shoppers on the southside. I definitely feel like this location is supported by a captive population. \n\nOf the few items I have purchased here, many of them had mystery stains or holes I didn't notice before I bought them, sadly. This is the thrift store in PGH I am most likely to leave Completely Empty Handed (a special feat, one that I perform only rarely)."
2;Spendy activity, but it's worth it for once in your lifetime kind of thing...\n\nWe came here for the night before our wedding day and it was pretty fun. The actual ice bar was pretty small compared to what I imagined. It was fun to drink cocktails in ice glasses. We had a great time chit chatting and froze our butts off.\n\nThe only issue was the photographer of this ice bar. She was very demanding and insisted on taking our pictures more than we would like it. It made the whole experience was not as fun as we would like it to be.\n\nAnyway, we had a great time, but it will be just one time visit to the ice bar.
3;"Probably the best deal in town for this class of Hotel (3.5 star) and one of the very few in Vegas not to charge a resort fee. Though the location is a little bit out of the way (by the convention center) overall compared to other hotels in the same class the hilton compares very well.\n\nBUT, if you're comparing the Hilton to a higher class hotel (and needless to say with higher prices) then I could see where the Hilton would not rate the same - OBVIOUSLY!\n\nI guess some people who complain excessively have caviar tastes on a \""Kia\"" budget. LOL"
1;$18 for a bowl of soup with a 1/2 pound of spagetti noodles, two thin slices of beef, a pinch of basil, a pinch of bean sprouts and a pinch of cilantro with a couple hot peppers.  Maybe it was because it was the end of my four days in Vegas and it gets tiring to be hammered with overpriced food day after day after day, but this was the final straw.
2;The dining room of Mesa Grill is very sleek with dark wood furniture and bursts of colorful accents.  The hostess was friendly, and our waiter was excellent.  The bread basket was good and came with blue corn and bell pepper muffins.  I ordered the corn soup to start and the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla.  The corn soup was excellent and had a spicy kick from the chipotle cream.  Quesadillas seem so pedestrian, but I was dying to try a Bobby Flay quesadilla.  Frankly, this was a bit disappointing because the tortilla seemed overcooked and slightly burnt.  The smoked chicken component was good, but I couldn't find much black bean.  Overall, this dish was underwhelming.  I also sampled my friend's veal, which was excellent.  The lobster tacos were very good but also very small.  I'd recommend Mesa Grill if you like dolled up Southwestern fare - just skip the quesadilla.
3;The park is probably better known for its 6.5 miles of single track mountain biking trails.  It has a little something for all skill levels, but it's very rooty.
3;This place is my guilty pleasure. The food is not really healthy but it tastes so good. I try to stay away from this place but I can't. I have probably tried 3/4 of the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. Chicken fingers, Italian beef, hamburgers, fish, cheese sticks, shrimp, Philly cheese steak are all great. Mild sauce is just like Chicago. The fries are good too, lightly battered and crispy. Prices are very good. Highly recommended.
3;We ate here last night before the hockey game. It was very good as usual if you can stand the wait. I had the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, my hubby had the mac & cheese, which he said is the best in town!\n\nI keep track of everything I eat so I really splurged on this 1500 cal burger and also at $13 it is pretty expensive for a burger, but man is this thing good!\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because we had to wait for a table which is not unusual Westgate but also because we didn't see our server for the first 15 minutes that we sat down. Once we did get her attention she was very quick, got us to hockey game on time and did everything else very well. \n\nIf you're in Westgate, it's not too crowded and you have a few extra bucks, I recommend this Yardhouse.
1;"Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\"" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.\nI don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre."
2;Early afternoon on a Friday, we ate at Tupelo's. We enjoy sitting at the tables in the bar and the food is always good, especially the biscuits. However, service is a different story. On this Friday afternoon Tupelo was not crowded. We ordered and it seemed to have taken an unusually long time for our food to arrive. We ate and then sat and sat and sat as we waited and watched our server chatting with someone else, checking her cell phone and disappear behind the swinging doors. I asked another server for a to go box. I asked one of the managers if we could get our check. We paid, left and will think twice about going back. Customers should not put up with lack of service.
4;Swim suit season is upon us.  So I stopped in Thinique North Scottsdale to see what kind of packages they might have.  All the ladies were very informative and the clinic is super clean!  I had a SkinnyBoost shot with vitamin B12 to help speed up my metabolism as well as give me some energy. I felt fabulous afterwards! If you are looking to shed a few extra pounds and need someone to help hold you accountable, then Thinique is the place to go.  They will work out a special diet and weight loss plan just for you.  Check them out.
2;Located across from Lowe's.  Easy to be tempted by Ray's Pizza just a couple doors down though.  Their burritos are made in front of you there and served in a large basket.  Portions were generous but the prices were up there to match.  Parking isn't bad at all because of the Lowe's lot.
2;Great Italian sub, also the greek salad is good too.  Customer service not so great....  We do love supporting local businesses.  Restaurant was busy for lunch  but unkept, there were picture frames and extra stuff blocking tables and on tables, so we could barely squeeze into our table from boxes etc...
2;I ordered the seafood trio over risotto. I wish I would have ordered something else because my plate was 1/3 of the size of everyone else's but was more expensive than anyone else's. The salmon and shrimp tasted good but the rest was just ok. For appetizers we got the calamari and spinach artichoke dip. Those were really good. And for dessert a peanut butter mousse thing that was awesome. Overall it was just an ok experience. Don't hate it. Don't love it. If someone wanted to go I wouldn't object but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
4;Very best, had this back in the midwest.  Vinny boy slider and cyclone with everything is what i order every time.
3;The dumplings are their saving grace. One star for each dumpling I ate. Everything else was pretty bad.\nFirst off, they ran out of plates. What kind of place runs out of plates?! The waitress gave us little plastic dipping cups instead.... which doesn't help.. Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. \nThe four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness. \n\nTIP: Wait a few more weeks for this place to work out some of their kinks before you go or you might not even be able to get the dumplings!
3;Amazing amazing place for a mommy and daddy get away here in town :) we went on the grinolda ride and our tour guide was just so wonderful. For the price of the food and the booze... I couldve made it better at home but, thats a five star get away for ya!
2;I still stand by the previous review. I do stop by if I am in the neighborhood and need coffee. However, this just isn't a place to hang out on a whim anymore.  It's usually PACKED between the hours of 10 to 6.  Outlets are at a premium. Bring an extension cord AND a power strip!
2;Visited the Rosehip on Sunday night for dinner. The place seemed relatively quiet when we arrived, we were sat by the window (to encourage passers by to enter).  Thankfully the heating was on full blast so this area was very cosy, however as the evening progressed it got busier and the new people were sat at the tables near us.  This would normally be fine, but we felt the tables were pretty close together, now in a confined space and it felt like everyone could listen in to each others conversation.  Became a little to cosy for my liking, especially since there was a large restaurant up the stairs at the back only half full. \n\nWe ordered burgers.  They arrived with nice big homemade wedges, coleslaw and the chicken burgers were big and all very filling.  All yummy but the white burger buns were a bit cheap tasting.  A seeded roll or more sturdy roll would have been better, the burger fell away from the hands and it was a bit messy.  \n\nPersonally prefer the Sea Dogs restaurant, who used to be sited here - gutted it closed!  Rosehip is trying and to gastro pub and restaurant dining, but I think they should stick to one or the other.
3;If you go here what you need to do is get on that meatball sub game. The meatballs are enormous, the cheese is melty and tasty and the sauce is robust. I like this place because the portion sizes are huge, possibly even too much as i never feel good after eating here. Then the bazooki cookie will find its way on my table and that melted piece of heaven comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and its 5 bucks. This place is dangerous because put it in the books that your going to fall asleep after. Great food just dont make plans to go out afterwards.
2;They have both a take out section (burritos/tacos/chips/simple salads) and a sit down section, which has a bigger mrenu. I ordered the shrimp salad. Crunchy textures and nicely cooked shrimp. Generous portion of salad. Cilantro lime vinaigrette had good flavor. But unfortunately, the dressing and shrimp were both too salty. Please cut down on the salt for your customers. I had to ask for three refills of water!
0;I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed.\n\nHere's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.\n\n- When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?\n\n- Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. \n\n- Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.\n\n- WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. \n\n- Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. \n\n- Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us. \n\nAll in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it.
0;"Don't come here until they figure out their new menu. We ordered a couple items off the new skinny menu and supposedly they are now cooking their thousands of menu items on the broiler. Maybe they are \""skinny\"" items because you will starve, it was an hour and a half till we got our food and all the manager could offer was 2 free cheesecakes (half of a normal portion) in return for a black and blue steak (which I sent back-it was ordered medium), cold fries, cold chicken tacos, cold burger with un-melted cheese, etc. It wasn't our waiters fault he did everything he could to deal with it and we tipped him accordingly. We ended up fighting our $150 bill and got our entrees removed since we ordered 3 rounds of drinks and there was something wrong with all of the entrees, the bill was still over $90. For tonight's performance, i would give no stars if I could."
1;Very disappointed in Aria.\n\n- $28 for any non-refundable charge\n- Overly engineered room. There are about 30 buttons to control the room. But, I cannot find the only one that matters : the lamp\n- The bed is too soft.
0;I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's several times before and they've done a (mostly) decent job washing my car, especially for the price. After my last experience I definitely will NOT be bringing my business to Danny's and DO NOT recommend you do either. \n\nAfter I left Danny's (on Highland) I noticed I had a big chunk of paint missing from my drivers-side rear bumper. It looks as though it scrapped up against something. The peel was fresh as all the paint had not peeled off. Admittedly, I had already waited almost 2 hours, after being told it would only be about 35 min for a wash and wax, so I was eager to leave and didn't give the car a full inspection before I left the property. \n\nI went back the next day to let the manager, Chris, know what had happened and he was very dismissive about my claim. This was after waiting almost 25 minutes for him to come to the front desk. According to him, all he knew was that I did it myself and was blaming it on them.... sure dude. I don't have proof that anything happened at Danny's but the fact that they weren't willing to investigate was very bothersome. \n\nMoral of the story we've called corporate and they were again very rude and dismissive. Did I mention they hung up on my wife? I don't expect Danny's to look into it and I don't want them to pay for my repair. Just want people to know this is how they treat their customers. Thanks Bye.
3;I raised my rating to four stars due to I returned for lunch today. The restaurant is close to where our conference was being held and was squeezed on time. I tried the lunch special - a bowl of curry on rice and a bowl of pork ramen with miso broth. Food tasted better today and was less salty.(Maybe because I drank last night?) The portion of ramen was still quite large and curry was very tasty for a bargain price of $12.95 including tip.
4;Have to give this place five stars.  Menu is great, value is great but the cook Jose is the best.  Great customer service, really knows how to treat a customer.  He gave me a sample of the Greek fries yesterday and they are out-of-this-world good!

0;This review is for the first 10 minutes of walking into my room.\n\nMy uncle plays at this casino almost every day that he lives here and the one time we decide to stay- they comp us a shit room. It's tiny, doesn't offer extra cots and the toilet- of course it doesn't wanna flush. Are all comped rooms like this? Maybe we should have just paid for the room... we will see if we decide to stay for the rest of the weekend.\n\nI stayed at the LVH for a nice 2 bedroom suite for $75... and $70 for a gorgeous one bedroom suite at Hard Rock Hotel!
3;Good food!!  Nice atmosphere!!
2;Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need.
1;I don't remember what roll I ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top. \nWe came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but I felt like we were rushed by the staff.
2;a decent spot for lunch given that it is pittsburgh.  it's maybe a little step up from your fast food chinese place in nyc, the quality is a little better and the restaurant itself is obviously cleaner.\n\ni started w/the egg flower soup, it was a little on the salty side, but at least seemed like it was all natural eggs and didn't have the weird fake dark yellow color to it that a lot of places have.  tea was on the house which is nice.  i had the eggplant in brown sauce w/white rice.  overall it was decent, eggplant tasted fresh, but this was also a little on the salty side as well.  \n\ni would have given it 2.5 stars if possible, but rounded up since the older waitresses are very nice and reminded me of my mom.  in the end a decent place for a quick cheap lunch (it's slim pickins for good restaurants in pittsburgh).
1;bad table at the back by the kitchen door, so we moved to the bar. Great Lemonade and beer. We had brisket and a burger it was not good. The brisket had no bark and it was laden with blobs of fat and thickly sliced, tasted more like a pot roast. The sauce was boring and the bread was also so very boring. The hamburger is supposed to be favorite but why?  The mac and cheese was an overly thick and gluey. No garnish on the plates and a badly bruised and bent pickle. Waiter overcharged us an extra sandwich. \nToo bad, we gave him a good tip anyway. Just an over-hyped place. Cute name and decor.
2;"If you're in Oakland with friends who are divided on drinking vs. eating, Fuel and Fuddle is a good compromise: big beer selection to satisfy the drinkers, and plenty of food options to keep the eaters happy.\n\nThe portions here are really generous.  While not listed directly on the menu, you can request a side of just sweet potato fries (instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries), and the plate you get is huge.  The pizzas here are pretty good, with thin crusts that are nicely chewy.  The dessert portions here are the largest I've ever seen--the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie I've seen.  I like how Fuel and Fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple \""burnover\"" by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry.  The dough itself, however, could have been more sweet--even with warm apple filling inside, the chocolate sauce drizzled on top, and the vanilla ice cream, I felt the dessert lacked something.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, this isn't a place to go to if you want to have conversations.  In a party of six, I had to stick to talking to the people right next to me, and even then I felt like I was nearly shouting.  The food and drinks here aren't bad at all, but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if I'm not already in Oakland."
0;absolutely lethargic, inexcusable and pathetic service, take ur money somewhere else, after 20 mins of waiting t the table there was no sign if service, even after complaining to the person in charge nothing changed, seriously expect people to shell $16 per dish with this sort if sloppy service..one of our worst experiences at a thai restaurant ever.
0;You get what you pay for.  Took my first and last trip on Spirit.  Flew from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale and back.  The plane was a dog.  My window seat looked like it was cleaned with mop water.  Garbage in my seat pocket.  A seat that wouldn't recline.  Dirty head rests.  A 4.5 hour flight and i'm not even offered water?  Maybe that's a good thing since only one of the two lavatories was working.  Spirit did get me there on time, but I ran for a shower immediately.
2;"I'll admit upfront that I'm not a huge gambler; however, I do enjoy the grandness and general environment of a casino. I like playing the cheap slots, watching some of the higher stakes games (from afar, of course), and maybe enjoying some free or at least cheap booze and food. I've been to the river casino 3 times and I've generally had a good time. One thing that I will complain about is that not only are the drinks not free, they're freakin expensive. From my experience this is very unique for a casino. Either way, it's a good time to spend a night here at least once to try your luck at some of the games. I may come back at some point and eat at one of the buffets, but on the other hand I may go somewhere with cheaper drinks and a better time."
0;"Stopped in here on my way to Pink Taco. Way disappointed in their Gay/Lesbian book selections. 1 measly little shelf- NOTE: shelf, NOT bookcase...\n\nFuck that! How are the conservative AZ's gonna come outta the closet without a \""how-to\"" manual?"
1;A half hour before a show, I wanted to get a quick bite. The closest place to get something was from The Roasted Bean. I ordered the pretzel bread ham sandwich with Swiss cheese and a drink. While the sandwich was $9.00, it wasn't made fresh in front of me. To get it ordered warm, they tossed it into the microwave. The preferred heating option would have been the toasting machine literally right next to it.\n\nI received my sandwich after it was nuked. It looked as if it lost half the size. The taste of the sandwich was good initially. Then I noticed part of my hand was in mushy bread. This was due to the tomato literally melting in it, when the sandwich was nuked.\n\nThen came a drink refill request. After paying nearly $4, $3.50 before tax, I would have thought refills would be included. As I found out, they are not.\n\nThis coffee shop charges premium prices for ready made sandwich and nearly four times the amount for a Coke, then its fast food competitors. They should make sandwiches to order and allow refills. That would make future customers want to return.
0;What I get for not having the energy to check Yelp before dining somewhere is a mediocre meal like we had here.  We just walked by and randomly decided to dine here.  The hostess and our waitress were very kind - but the service was SLOW and the food bland.  Dressing up all the ladies in skimpy clothes does not make the food taste any better.  Their kitchen also needs to learn how to marinate foods or use sauces to their advantage.  Here's a quick breakdown: \n\n- bone marrow - so bland and not worth it.  The bones are not cut lengthwise, so the unseasoned marrow is deep and hard to get to.  \n- chicken panini - the chicken was dry from being over cooked and it was under seasoned.  The panini could have used some spread or sauce inside since it was very dry and bland.\n- fish and chips - the fish was okay but the fries were all little bits in both my husband and brother's order of it - it looked like they got the very bottom of the bag of frozen fries.\n\nMy recommendation is to move onto another restaurant...sorry Alexandre Restaurant.
3;Ever wonder who started the fair trade coffee brigade?  Well Michelangelo's is one of the first!  \n\nThis place is truly for the coffee purist.  If you don't want your palate muddled by milky add ins and pumps of sugar, you will be pleased that Michelangelo's offers coffee imported from gosh darn every continent you can think of.  But you can sure pick from a bunch of other sweet coffee drinks too! \n\nTea drinkers don't stray away.  You can fill your tea cup with all sorts of white, black, or green teas.  \n\nExtra seating in the back allows you and your hunny bunny to snuggle up and sip on your brews in privacy.  \n\nKeep your eyes open.  This place is so close to the capitol, you might stumble upon a politician!
4;"I'm a big fan of small and local business and I must admit I felt a little protective when I saw a Fox Concepts restaurant going up in my own neighborhood.  I finally decided to try it with a friend and I have to say it's a wonderful addition to current Arcadia offerings.\n\nI stopped by ahead of time to grab a menu to peruse and I was immediately excited because I saw that if my first visit was good, I'd have to do about 10 more to sample everything that caught my eye.  When I see \""Italian\"" I brace myself for more of the same old pastas and sauces, but this menu has a lot of variety, and it includes seasonal offerings (which as a nutritionist is important to me).\n\nI tried a farro-kale salad and would order it again (on trip 11, after trying everything else!)\n\nMy friend and I sat on the patio which, despite the cold night, was packed the entire time we were there.\n\nI do love the neighboring restaurants but it's nice to have a little bit of competition for inspiration.  So happy this is within walking distance for me!\n\nValet parking is complimentary, by the way, for those who drive."
0;Checking in, the lady was rude.  Reserved on the internet 2 adjoining rooms & that did not happen.  The go into 1 room & it was dirty.  Trash on the floor and someone had obviously been laying on the bed. Towel on the floor in the bathroom. \nThen went to my Mamas room, the a/c was not working.  The refrigerator was not working & had mold all in it.  The smell that lingered in the room was nasty.  The worst first impression ever!!!
4;Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.\n\nOn a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.\n\nOh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed.
0;HORRIBLE PLACE!!!! \n\ngot the filet mignon and lobster tail! the lobster tail was HORRIBLE it tasted like rubber way over cooked and too much sauce which gave a horrible nauseous feeling!!\n\nthe filet mignon was already had better at cheesecake factory.\n\nThe roasted chicken was over cooked and disgusting.\n\nthey messed up on the french fries that we had ordered on the side.... it was burnt!!!!!!!!!\n\nthe service was horrible.... we saw a waitress maybe once or twice... throughout the night before we were given the check. She never once came by to check on us and the food!!!!!\n\nour main server was the bus boy who got everything and was friendly enough to check on us... unlike the waitress.\n\n\nwe did make reservations and ended up being seated 30 min later as well..\n\n5 star restaurant? I THINK NOT!\n\n\nTHINK AGAIN BEFORE COMING HERE.\n\nour bill came out to 225.\n\nfor over cooked food...
3;I've been coming here for years and everytime it's just as good as the last and the portions are satisfying especially for the price.  The bread in beginning is light and toasty, the before you know it your food is here. Flavorful rice, black beans, salsa chicken and chicken bistec is the best I've tried so far. Who cares about the neighborhood no one bothers you, it's just at the north part of the strip where all of the chapels are.
2;I believe that this place was over hyped. It built our expectations way too high and therefore we came out a little disappointed. \n\nWe bought these coupons for 33% off, what we didnt know is that it only applied on a small section of the menu and so ending up we didnt really even use the coupon and paid full price.\n\nIt was pricey, which we anticipated. The food however was lacking. it was small portions and nothing seemed to wow us. I gave this place 3 stars because I didn't think it was that bad. but my friends who I came with trashed down on the place. \n\nI had the surf and turf roll, it was 6 small pieces and the insides of it was good but the seared tuna on top was not.\n\nNever eat seafood at vegas. it's never fresh.. think about out. Vegas = Desert= no ocean= no fish = fish trucked in from west coast= not fresh!! \n\nThe halibut looked very delicious, but just wished the taste was just as nice.  \n\nClam chowder which was above average I would say, lots of clams, too salty though.\n\nHerbal fries... tasted like ketchup to be honest.  \n\nThey give you corn bread and biscuits when you first sit down. the corn bread is to die for. it was perfection. \n\nOverall it was for the experience, I  don't think I'll be coming back to dine though.
2;This is a tough event to review.  If I could give half stars, I would go with 2.5.\n\nI had never been to a performance of the Singing Christmas tree before, so I was looking forward to checking it out. As Chad mentioned in his review, the show was an odd mixture that included traditional Christmas songs, international Christmas songs, puppets, and dancers. \n\nThe singers making up the tree did sound pretty good for most of the songs they performed and the soloist had a nice voice.  However, there were a few songs that did not get very good treatment. For example, I felt that their performance of Feliz Navidad was watered down and washed out.  It was a disappointment.  Overall though, I would rate the singers a solid 3 stars. \n\nThe dancing was hit or miss. I enjoyed the Irish dancers, but some of the other dances were not my cup of tea. A couple of times, I felt the dances seemed a bit out of place for this type of performance - the rockette style dancing by younger performers seemed a bit odd to me. I would give this portion of the show 2 stars.\n\nI like the Grey Seal Puppets but honestly, the storyline of the polar bear puppet was a bit on the silly side.   The talents of the Grey Seal Puppeteers are much more apparent in their other performances. \n\nHowever, the biggest problems I noticed were with the venue itself. I would give the venue 1 star.   First off, when we arrived, there were a lot of seats that had been double-booked.  I have never seen that type of chaos at any type of performance I have been to. It was bizarre.\n\nThe acoustics in this venue have always been bad, and they still are. \n\nThen, the seats were actually uncomfortable and I felt squished into my seat sitting between one big person and one tall person.  I almost felt claustrophobic at times. \n\nTo top it all off, it was really hot in there.... so uncomfortable that we thought about leaving halfway through the show.   We did end up staying for the entire performance but I have to admit, I felt a sense of relief when the show was over.
4;Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular.
0;Worst saleswoman ever. My husband and I were going for a stroll after a fantastic dinner. When we go on vacation (rare occurrence), we like to buy something that is his and hers. My birthday is also coming up and we wanted to take a look at the belt colors and buckles.  She hesitantly asked us if there was something we were interested in. As soon as I uttered belt, she looked me up and down and said that none of her belts will fit me. How rude!! I'm a size 6 in pants. We were dressed fairly modestly so how would she know that we were both physicians who could afford an extravagant belt, or 2. I will never purchase anything in this store and I suggest the same to you. If I could give this store's location a negative star, I would.
1;Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else.
3;One of the larger and nicer Marshall's stores I've been to and possibly the cleanest one in town. They offer name brand and designer clothing at pricing much below standard retail and I love shopping here because there are usually good deals to be found, especially in the clearance section if you can find your size. Notable features of this store include a large shoe and home selection, as well as plenty of cell phone accessories, and in the men's section there are a decent selection of suits, dress shirts and ties. There was a pretty decent line going at the register when I walked in but it was gone by the time I was ready to check out, so the employees here are pretty efficient. We used to live in the area and now occassionally stop by whenever we're in the area because of the variety of items and size of store here compared to other locations.
0;Worst place on the west side.  Bartenders don't know how to keep track of anything.  Charged me the same amount twice on separate debit cards.  Won't be returning
0;My wife and I had lunch.  we ordered the special, Philly cheesesteaks. The bread was so stale and had been left on the grill so long that the sandwiches were dry and inedible we had to request additional ranch dressing . After reminding the waiter twice we finally received our ranch dressing and some mayo.  The roast beef was so tough and stringy we finally asked for boxes and took our sandwiches home where we fed them to our dog who love them. However, the onion rings were superb.
3;Friendly staff and they try to make your wait short and comfortable while you wait for your car to be serviced.......One thing that would make it a bit nicer would be to have to drivers since they are driving us all over town to get home.
4;Stephen is the best in the business! I just had my 2009 ford fusion tinted today and it looks amazing! He was professional from start to finish. His work is absolutely beautiful, a true artist so to speak. He clearly takes pride in his work and makes it look all too easy. His price was perfect and the product was even better. He applied nano-ceramic tint on all windows and I couldn't be happier. He made a customer for life out of me. Take him your car... You won't be disappointed!!
1;its was ok. not really worth all the hype\n\nPrice: a lot\nPresentation: good\nTaste: okay\nservice: okay
4;Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. \n\nThey have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. \n\nThe only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them.
0;Rude, service. Was argumentative and short with me. I was the only customer in the store. Was undecided about a purchase and opted for a few chemicals and some goggles. My biggest issue was I added the liquid chlorine and it did NOT have any effect on my tested levels. I added 1 more about 6 hours later. No effect! This was unusual for me as I've been using the same routine for years. I called and the guy was rude on the phone. Strike that-he just seemed annoyed that I dared to even call. I use a different store usually and was lazy, which is why I came to Leslie's which was next door to the place I came from earlier. Big mistake. I'll just go to the competitor I've been going to for years for now on.
3;I went here with my out of town guests to redeem a match play deal advertised on the bar's Web site. It's a typical neighborhood poker bar with a tropical theme (love the small waterfall) and tiki decor. Any place that offers a match play is a winner in my book, though we didn't try the food.\nThe bartender offered to serve the Blue Moon with orange juice, which is also a winner. \nThis is a Steelers bar, and as such, promos and prizes are offered during all games.
1;First I have to say I have been here before and thought it was one of the better massages I have received. However that was not the case this time. The spa is small and is nothing more than a converted hotel room so the area is not super fancy. I filled out the form and had a casual conversation with my masseuse and the receptionist about my previous massage there and how I have a bad sciatica. Once in the room my masseuse never asked where I wanted to focus on or what to avoid. The massage itself was ok but she hit the bad spot on my back twice without even acknowledging it. Most of the time they will question my tenderness there and offer some suggestions but not this time. But the massage could have been worse because while I was having my mediocre massage my husband was next to me having the worst massage of his life. By the time his masseuse had coughed the third time over him I expected him to insist the massage ended. Needless to say this will be our last Hands on massage.
1;COX, You stood me up. I'm hurt. I stayed in this unhealthy relationship because you said you would try your best. Then, you stand me up. Yes, I've been waiting for 2 hours, only to find out, no one is coming. I guess I made the mistake.\n\nThere has to be a support group. I feel so, so empty. Why doesn't anybody care?\nWHY???? \n\nMaybe you'll show up next week....maybe?
1;*I am not a vegetarian. \nMy usual Thai restaurant was closed so we've decided to try another place out.\n\nOrdered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice.\n\nNoodle for pad thai was undercooked, it was too chewy and some part was hard. \nThey did not ask us for the level of spiciness, just gave us a very sweet pad thai. It was too sweet for me, because I usually have spicy pad thai.\nOther than that it was okay.\n\nFor the pineapple fried rice, it just tasted like catchup. \nSome might like it, but not for me. I am used to other restaurants' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all.\nFor me it was horrible. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is outdated. Looks like a local family owned restaurant.  Nothing below or above that. Which I do not mind anyway.\n\nOverall, I would describe the food as...food I get to eat when I go over friend's house. Not extremely good and not awfully bad, but just little different taste than what I usually have. Different style.\n\nDefinitely a homemade food taste. If you get what I mean.
1;The hotel rooms and hallways are dark and depressing.  Even the elevators are dark and depressing.  The casino is great though. The buffet is awesome.  I think I will stay at the Paris and walk over to gamble and eat at the buffet.
4;This place is Amazing!!! The food id Delicious and the atmosphere is just fun! They have Salsa Nights on Saturdays and the music is great! Definitely top 5!!!!
2;For under $20 my gf and I got two quarter chickens with potatoes, coleslaw, macaroni salad, pop and a portuguese egg tart. My gf got the mild sauce and I got the spicy sauce, the spicy sauce had a nice kick to it however the chicken did not have much flavour. The chicken was pretty moist and tender but not as good as Romados like others have mentioned. Got only a few potatoes which were soft and hot, once again not that much flavour with those as well. The macaroni/coleslaw salad was decent and my gf said the tart was good but did not taste fresh.\n\nOverall I give this place a 3.5/5, food was just okay and the same goes for the price.
2;Good food and prices, but nothing that surprises. I could not taste any wood in the barbecue. The ribs were fall off the bone, and the cole slaw is excellent. I thought the staff very pleasant. If you are in Anthem, this is a reasonable place for a decent, reliable lunch.
0;Do I even have to give a star? In Australia we call this style of dining yum cha.  \n\nFirstly, They say the kitchen closes at 3pm, and we arrived at 2pm. The dim sum cart came around once, then we were told to order from the menu if we wanted more food. The service was SHOCKINGLY BAD, they would ask you a question, and then ignore the answer, only to ask the question again, only to get caught up in a conversation with another server, only to ask the question again.\n\nI can't even be bothered telling you all the other issues here, because I want to clear my head space from people/businesses like this.\n\nNEXT!
3;I love the Spiedini! Every bite was freakin' awesome! The Italian Fontina is not like any cheese I've ever had before. Combined with the Prosciutto di Parma takes this appetizer to another level. YUMMY!\n\nI love the Wiseguy! Grilled onions never tasted so good. The weirdest thing was the very last bite tasted the best. It's like I'm emotionally attached to that last bite and how it made me feel. YUM!!!\n\nI hate the Sonny Boy but I'm not an olive person. Every bite was overwhelming with an olive taste. YUCK!!!\n\nI could of done without the 2 and half hour wait though. Since there is a wait, people get super drunk. When you're sober and everyone around you is drunk, it can be a tad bit annoying and loud. The restaurant is super small. There is no room to really have an intimate experience when people are yelling in your ear.\n\nAlso, I could care less for the service. I guess when you're not hurting for business you could act however you want. I totally don't agree with that statement. I hope the staff reads these yelp reviews and improves the service. Eventually, the bad service will outweigh the taste of the food. Then people will stop coming.\n\nIf I ever had the chance to come back, I would probably order takeout. The website said you couldn't but I saw someone who did. It also said they validate, and they do but it doesn't cover the whole parking fee.\n\nOverall, I'm still happy that I got to experience the BEST PIZZA for myself. It's pretty cool to say I've had Pizzeria Bianco. So I would suggest anyone to give it a try just expect the wait and the rudeness. Hopefully, the food will make it all worth for you.
0;We brought our BMW for a simple repair they gave it back to us undriveable and wouldn't help rectify the problems that they caused. We finally took it to another shop and had to pay thousands to fix the problems that goodspeed caused. Go elsewhere.
0;"Looking for some quick dinner, my sister and I decided to just ask for a to-go order from Rick's. I ordered a flat bread pizza, and she had the tacos. We were told 15 minutes by the hostess. She took my last name down and room number. We didn't really wander because we didn't want to miss our food in the short 15 minutes. So we sat on the benches in the hallway, IN CLEAR VIEW of the hostess. \n\n20 minutes pass, 30 minutes... 35. She hadn't called us yet. So I got up to ask.\n\""How much longer for our food?\"" \n\""OH, I was wondering where you guys went...\"" as she grabbed our food from a table right next to the entrance.\n\nI wanted to scream. Are you kidding me?! We were sitting in front of her the entire time. Not ONCE did she even TRY calling out our name. I was SO frustrated, but being in a upscale resort, I kept my cool. Instead, I just didn't tip because waiting 40 minutes is UNACCEPTABLE when we were told 15. Putting forth ZERO effort in attempting to find your customers is UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nThe food wasn't even that great either. AND it's expensive. I had much higher expectations for at least the service."
3;I really like The Quad for gaming. They have cheap Blackjack tables and the restaurants inside like Hash House A Go Go are awesome. I also like the new LINQ area that has been built in between it and Flamingo, which has a bunch of new bars and places to shop. I am not the biggest fan of the Sportsbook at this casino, but there are plenty of other Sportsbooks in the area. I am a Total Rewards member, so it's even more appealing for me to gamble and spend money here. I normally stay at the other Total Rewards casinos like Flamingo, Caesars, and Harrahs. I decided to give The Quad rooms a try this coming weekend, so maybe they can earn that extra star this coming weekend.
3;Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.
0;"I never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.\n\nMy friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. I don't know what she was thinking. Not my scene whatsoever! We had come from a free Devo concert. I was dressed in converses,  a side pony tale, and bright pink 80's garb. \n\nI have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. The chicks looked at me like I was an alien. Not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels, gobs of makeup, and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress.\n\n I like fashion, I love heals. It was the glassy, vapid, duplicates that I saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously BOLT out the door! Super bad energy in this place. I jumped in the first cab I saw and headed to Lawrenceville. I didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. Smoke bomb disappeared! She knew I would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. I was pissed.\n\nThe night was not lost. My awesome \""fiends\"" from LA (stunt man Curtze, and Elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. I meant to write \""friends\"" but didn't change it because fiends, haha... much more appropriate. \n\nI am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. Some of my favorite people like Bossa Nova. Just stating my personal experience."
0;By far the worst car wash I've used. My car ended up worse coming out. I had to go to the gas station next door to wipe down my windshield since there was soap streaks all over it. It looked like my car was rained on and left to dry. Save yourself the time.
3;"Sunday night, one week after the Steelers were officially \""out\"".  The restaurant was not crowded.  There were (2) 20-somethings and (2) 50-somethings which turned into (2) Burgers (1) Pulled Pork and (1) Angus Salad.  \n\nEverything was done perfectly.  Calamari was spicy, tender and fantastic.\n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  Almost too dark to enjoy the meal, but ok.  We all agreed that we'd like to go back and try out a few other menu items.  Especially in the summer, to try out the patio!"
1;First time here and we had heard great things from friends about their breakfast. \n\nMy meal was pretty cold when it arrived and cold hash browns really don't do it for me! The poached eggs were perfect and the wholewheat toast was unusually good but to eat a meal that is half the right temperature and half cold is not great.\n\nService was very friendly and coffee refills came quickly and without asking which is always appreciated.\n\nUnfortunately breakfast joints are pretty much everywhere in Chandler so when you have such a choice an experience like this is not going to make me come back.
3;"This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their \""Hawaiian\"" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc. \n\nBut the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon \""the best pork\"" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.\n\nSo we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.\n\nThey have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.\n\nSo yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all."
0;I have never had such bad service in my life!  Came in to find the hostess on the phone for about 10 minutes before even greeting me.  Finally, I was seated hoping my experience here would get better.  Then the waitress was horrible!  What are the chances.  She didn't make eye contact, wasn't friendly....can't say anything good about her.  The food was okay, but after the terrible service, the food didn't matter.  I couldn't wait to get out of there!  That waitress needs to find another job where she has no contact with the public.
3;This is an addendum to a previous review (which was filtered for no reason). But, let me tell you, Thrifty's is starting to learn (not completely) the trick. Instead of using pins to secure their tags, this last group of shirts I just dropped off (n=20) all had the tags wrapped around the shirts tag and stapled at the ends (thus not wasting a pin and not putting a hole in the shirt! the only thing is they have yet to do this through a buttonhole which would be the next level of great). I think this is the one folks.
1;"I knew what I was getting into when I booked reservations at this hotel so I can't really say I was surprised at the experience. I was expecting dumpy, run down, lots of kids and probably not that great of service and that's basically what we got. \n\nWhy'd I still go ahead and book my reservation? Frightdome. Frightdome was one of the big reasons we came to Vegas on this trip. So we figured \""Might as well book a room in the same hotel that Frightdome will be in so we can just crawl back to our rooms when all is said and done.\"" and that's basically what we did. \n\nWe booked a room for Saturday night. Arrived a couple of hours before Frightdome was set to open, dropped our bags off in the room and actually rested a bit. To be honest...the rooms were actually pretty decent and the walls must have been super thick because I never heard anyone in the hallway or in the rooms around us the entire time. \n\nThe hotel/casino itself like I stated before is rundown and just not a pleasant experience. But on the upside it was a 10 minute walk from our room to Frightdome. Check in was a nightmare. They only had two people checking people in. We got in about a 20 person line and by the time we got up to the desk the line had doubled. When I commented about the lack of staff the person checking us in said that the hotel had made lots of cuts. Wonderful. \n\nOh, well. We had a decent night's sleep and got the hell out of dodge come 8am."
3;Un des meilleurs spa int\u00e9rieur. Pourtant pas forc\u00e9ment beaucoup de bains mais on appr\u00e9cie le calme. On peut faire les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes, Bains chauds ou sauna, puis bain froid, puis relaxation.\nOn aime la petite salle dans l'obscurit\u00e9 pour se d\u00e9tendre seul ou \u00e0 2 et faire dodo pendant une vingtaine de minutes pour relaxer compl\u00e8tement.\nQuand on sort de cet endroit, on se sent vraiment d\u00e9tendu. \nPar rapport aux autres spa, il faut r\u00e9server pour le circuit, c pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable.
0;I love cupcakes and since my birthday was around the corner I decide to try this shop out. \nLet's just say that Gigi Cupcakes = NASTY\n\nI don't know what was put in those 3 cupcakes that I had. But I sick  for two days, plus a sugar high with all that frosting. \n\nI ordered Carrot cake, Caramel sugar mama, Cherry limeade, Italian cream wedding cake, Red velvet, and Strawberry shortcake.\n\nCaramel sugar mama was ok- I had that for breakfast- way too much icing and it was too big to eat\nRed velvet- cream cheese icing was good but way to much icing, the red velvet tasted like Duncan Hines and then they put some nasty red filling inside it. (Hell white sauce tastes better then that).\nCherry limeade- it tasted nothing like the 99cent minute maid I get from Wally-world.\n\nGood thing I'm not in Ca because I'm sure that the other three cupcakes that I threw in the trash, the dumpster divers wouldn't have ate it.\n\n***Gigi needs major improvement when it comes to cupcakes-They need to get help/tips from other bakeries\nSN-They need to make mini cupcakes-jumbo cupcakes are a no-no \n\nI'm sure this one will get flag or deleted like the first one
0;Very disappointing.  I would actually give this place a zero but yelp requires at least one star. This place is over priced and under staffed during dinner hours which caused significant delay. The food was warm at best and had to send my son's plate back because it was cold. They corrected the cold chicken fingers by dumping them back into the deep fryer. They were inedible at that point. I'm very excited to see what restaurant will move in next.....it's just a matter of time.
4;My boyfriend and I dined in and thoroughly enjoyed it. Food was good and our hostess/waitress was great!!! Good food, great service, great price.
3;I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!
1;Meaty. Markety. Should be ladies night everynight--there were some incredibly tireless, strong and fun women who seemed to love their music--knew all the lyrics. They made  my night! Save the adorable security staff, men didn't really dance, except for a few who didn't know how to put down their drink--it's a DANCE CLUB. Are those boys there for themselves? Priority for me: first is the dance. Enjoying atmosphere/scenery is second--and scouting is a far third. Go to Axis Radius to be, have and behold some grope and ogle. Reminds me of Borderline, in Chicago--closed now, i think. They serve as the after bar party--but that means to me, they should be open til 4am--if it were not for Scottsdale law, eh?
0;I took my newborn at cascade location for her very first visit and the front staff are horrible. They dont make u feel welcome in any way.no hi, no good morning like they hate their job(they suck and miserable). Dont bother calling their medical assistance phone line because no one will reply. We called a couple of times and after 48hrs still had no reply, seems like they dont care about our concerns with the babys health but I bet theyre on point on billing matters. I recommend united healthcare at sw location with dr Dani my other child used to go there, Its just too bad they dont take culinary insurance.
2;The majority of reviews pan this simple, Italian restaurant.  While they definitely could use some training in how to cook pasta al dente, there is some great construction of dishes and flavors going on.  PLEASE serve warm bread and olive oil!!   The veal was cooked well, the meatballs dense and flavorful. The tiramisu was one of the best I have ever eaten! The service was sweet and personal. Still guys, overcooked pasta will leave most patrons not wanting to return even if the sauce on top is tasty
0;Waste of money, I went with 4 friends and all of us were falling asleep.
4;"Went here in July with colleagues; was surprised it was not listed on Yelp!  So, this is my first time to add a new restaurant for others to discover.  The food was excellent.  And the star of the experience was the unique approach of dual wine pairings - one which is an expected match (the accord) and an unexpected match (the discord).  Everyone enjoyed their food, the staff was quite cordial and the wine was, indeed, a nice fit to the culinary experience.    Check this place out and be one of the first Yelpers to see what you've been missing."
3;I have been frequenting Hef's since their opening night. I almost always find myself satisfied. The place is rarely crowded during the day. The staff is very laid back and generally friendly. One thing I have noticed is they must have a subscription to like ESPN6 because there always seems to be some offbeat sporting event on their TV's. \n\nI have always enjoyed my food there. Yes, always. They have a good burger, excellent turkey club... yeah it's not a complicated menu but they get it right. There's not much to the salad if you get it as a side so I'd probably opt for the fries or pay extra for the mixed veggies. I haven't had the wings in a while but those were pretty good too.\n\nUnfortunately, as of January 2010 they no longer do lunch hours. I told you it was never crowded in there so I guess that's what happens. That kind of sucks.\n\nMy one gripe? They're charging in the 8 to 9 dollar range for many of their sandwiches. I have no problem with the price because it's quality. But for God's sake, their house ketchup tastes terrible. If I'm paying top dollar for a good sandwich, can I get a decent ketchup for the burger or fries? It's like having Marilyn Monroe as a model and dressing her in parachute pants. C'mon Hef's, you've gotta do better than that.
1;The bartender is great. Hustler, he should be managing the joint...the service for the actual restaurant...sucked ass!  Make sure you don't come too hungry cause you'll be waiting a while...food was moderate for most of our party, they ordered burgers and pulled pork special, I ordered broasted pork chop...stick to the burger and save some $
3;I became acquainted with The Maine Lobster Lady food truck at the 2013 Las Vegas Foodie Fest.  After an announcement that only 20 Lobster Rolls were left, I sweated it out but remained in line, because I was about the 14th person from the window.  When I reached the ordering station the truck was already out of Blueberry Lemonade at 8:30 p.m. on the second day of the festival, but I was able to secure one of the last Lobster Rolls.  \n\nThe roll itself was rather small, and its contents were not warm like I thought they would be.  Instead this lobster Roll was refreshingly cold.  But it was chock-full of chunks of lobster graced by a light Lemon Mayonnaise Dressing.  Even the flippers tasted good!  I liked this cold roll despite my erroneous preconceptions of what it would be like.  It was served with a cold pickle spear, a small bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, and a wedge of lemon.  Priced at $18 a roll, there had better be some bang for the buck!  And there was!
2;Wonderful food and shopping available, but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips?  This isn't a European nightclub.
0;Terrible. Had the car for eight hours. Couldn't find the key when we got here --luckily we brought an extra. Was supposed to be a detail and wax for 90$.  It still had bugs on the front end and the interior was not clean either.  There were swirl marks from the buffer that you could see once the car was in the sunlight.  Total lack of attention to detail.
4;"Holy Cow Batman.  Ya gotta check this place out.  I am on a Thai food kick after 45+ years of avoiding it and this place is one of the best for sure!\n\n1.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, modern place good for dates or the family, trendy or casual.  Located on Horizon Ridge and Horizon Ridge in Henderson near the 215.  Easy access and parking.\n\n2.  Service - Pleasant, welcoming, just perfect.\n\n3.  Prices - Extremely reasonable. Not cheap, not expensive, just right.\n\n4.  Food -  What a great experience. We ordered all spice medium as to not get blown out and not be able to really taste the food.  Medium has a great kick to it, but not overpowering.  As they grade from 1-4, we actually ordered 2.5\n\na.  Tom Yum Soup - We ordered a small, just enough to share for two. Tasty, tender chicken, and just right.\n\nb.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - This is my comparison dish.  I order this at every Thai place and here, it was very, very nice. Tender eggplant, succulent ground pork. Could not ask for a better flavor.\n\nc.  Pad Kee Mau - this noodle dish they describe as \""Drunken Noodle\"" what Thai people order after a night of drinking. This is an amazing dish. The wide noodles are the right firmness, the sauce very flavorful, the chicken mean was very tender alsos.\n\nd.  Red Curry Chicken - WOW. You cannot go wrong with this.\n\n\n5.  Dessert - Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango Ice Cream.  Hubba bubba.  I am rolling out of this place now. Call for a tow truck.  I am gonna burst.\n\nDelicious.  GK says, check it out!\nOverall,"
2;This place seems like a good idea in theory. Not so much in reality. Positives first: they have an excellent beer selection. To my great and joyous surprise, they aren't too heavy on the IPAs. Lately all the good bars have been plagued by those hyper hoppy hipster beverages. The selection of beers from local breweries is great too. Also, they have a really great specials on Fridays (today's is fish and chips and a beer for $10). \n\nThe bad? The service is painfully slow. I stood at the bar for 15 minutes waiting to get a beer. There were 3 servers working. Sigh. It was around happy hour and pretty busy. I'm totally willing to give it another try. But just be prepared to wait.
2;When I first discovered this place, I (or some member of my family) came religiously so I could satisfy my craving for the chicken kabob plate. This meal, to me, was the perfect blend of my favorite stuff: grilled boneless chicken kabob, perfectly seasoned rice and awesome salad. We even braved the terrible service of the girl who used to answer the phone (she was very rude) to come and get this food!\n\nHowever, at some point they decided to change things around. The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella. I love cheese but I loved feta in this setting more so the change was annoying to me. By far, though, the rice change realllllly got me. It got me so much that I stopped eating here.\n\nThen, I decided to give it another try. To my surprise, the rice was ALMOST back to what it used to be. I was temporarily happy again!! Until, several weeks later, another craving hit and I went back to get takeout and I was given the type of rice that I hate. This ruined the entire meal for me. I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.\n\nIn any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him. He recognizes some members of my family and says hi and that is nice also. I do hope the restaurant does well and maybe one day I'll be back (maybe).
2;"Mr. Puck strikes again with another excellent somewhat casual little gem, this time tucked away in the Crystal shops at City Center.  This place shares many of the accolades you'll find at Puck's Bar & Grill in MGM, but falls a bit short of it's big brother in consistency, food quality, and service - The Pizzeria & Cucina, however, is still relatively green when compared to the Bar & Grill, and with time I would expect to see the P&C move into line with the B&G.\n\nThe P&C is a bit more casual than the B&G, and most of the other Puck establishments in Vegas.  Seating can be a bit slow at time, and the service is noticeably more casual and laid back than some of the other locations.  As you would imagine, the pizza here is top notch, and would be recommended.  The a large portion (if not all) of remained of the menu seems to be ported over from the Bar & Grill, however the execution is typically less consistent here.  The food is in no way bad, or even close to it, but the casual attitude in the front of the house seems to have found it's way back into the kitchen as well.  \n\nI should note that during my first visit here (with my parents), they mentioned I was a local, and the server gave up 20% off the check - it was a very nice touch.  While I am mentioning the bill, the Pizzeria is definitely a bit more affordable than the Bar & Grill, which is about the only advantage it has over it's big brother.\n\nThe bottom line: this is a great place to eat, but it's worth the extra walk up the strip to the Bar & Grill in MGM Grand; however, if you are too lazy, you will not be dissatisfied with the Pizzeria & Cucina."
4;We just had a perfect meal at Anthony's. It was our first time there and selected this spot based on the great reviews. The reviews were right on the money. Impeccable service, white linen table cloths, and excellent food. I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad, then moved on to the bone in, New York steak. Wow! That steak was perfect in every way. I just had to pick up the bone and savor every morsel of tasty meat!  If you are not a penny-pincher, and you are looking for a quality spot to have a great meal, then this is a sure choice in Henderson.
2;Home of the $1.50 burger!!! But their wings are really good, grilled or regular. Always a local crowd at the bar watching games on theor millions of screens. Bartenders are all very attentive, beer is cold. They have specials Tues and Wed.  LIke half price wings and tacos. No complaints. Nice, homey joint. Oh and they have a $3 breakfast!! For the morning after.
2;"Low-limit casino next to the Flamingo and Imperial Palace; as everyone here has said, it markets to the younger crowd, as the beer pong tables in the back say it all (no thanks, give me the harder stuff). Won $20 on roulette and lost it on the slots; worth another visit when I return to Vegas--whenever that is."
4;Ryan is an amazing personal trainer who will bring everything to you and give you a serious full body work out. He helped me plan my meals and prepare for the miss AZ USA pageant. I highly recommend the get fit group to anyone looking to improve their overall health and wellness.
2;Go to SC to buy your gas, it's cheaper than Charlotte. This is not as cheap as going down to Rock Hill. I buy  gas here and sometimes use the car wash.
1;Food was okay, service was fine.. but got serious diarrhea shortly after leaving there (both of us did)... same thing happened last time we were there also.  The first time I wrote it off as a fluke, could have caught that bug elsewhere.. but two times?  Health Department is failing us here, and so is Tony Roma's.
0;Horrible taco place.  Do not eat here.  We ordered pastor and asada tacos, asada fries and some chicken taquitos.\n\nThe pastor was flavorless, just tasted like pork.  The asada was also flavorless and had a lot of gristle in it, it was actually hard to eat.  Which made the asada fries suck.  The fries had cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  I like a combination of both.  Chicken taquitos were the best part of the meal and that's not saying much.  How can u screw up a taquito, it's just stuffed and fried. \n\nWill never be back and I will steer people away.
3;I think the rating is true to what it is... 4 out of 5. I happened to come here on the weekend so it was a Champagne Brunch. Like everyone here suggested. Come like 3-3:30 before dinner rolls out so you can pay the brunch price (no champagne is 24 bucks, with champagne is 28/29 bucks--i forget). The food was delicious with things, I'd probably have never tried in my life. Buffalo was decent but it was a little on the dry side. Prime rib was delicious as well as the lamb. Dessert was yum yum with creme brulee (that was bruleed in front of you). But the staff was attentive and pretty good about taking your dishes away once you were completed. I'd come back again!
3;I had a really nice waiter and the food were great! The waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it. He made it sound really good and I ended up getting it. Taste magnificent!
2;"I absolutely LOVE Cirque shows, having seen a couple before (Ovo & Zumanity), so I was really excited when my boyfriend was offered comp tickets for his birthday in Las Vegas. Our seats were perfect, right in the middle about 6 rows up from the stage. I was extremely impressed with the set, as it was beautiful, and the water acts were gorgeous. Unfortunately, I was slightly underwhelmed. I don't know if it was just me, but I found the comedy to be lacking...the clown humour wasn't funny and I actually found it to be pretty boring. I was expecting to see more \""AMAZING\"" acrobatics, but aside from the beautiful diving (that takes talent) and a couple other acts (fire dancers, jumpers) I was really unimpressed. I didn't understand the story they were trying to tell, and some of the scenes were downright confusing. What was with the guy holding the 1-800 sign? Not to mention, I felt creeped out by it, like it was a weird acid trip. Those guys in the red coats are what nightmares are made out of. I love Cirque du Soleil and \""O\"" was a nice way to spend an evening, but overall I'm glad we didn't pay for the tickets. We found ourselves yawning towards the end and unfortunately, we were glad when it ended. Next time, I will see Ka or Mystere!"
0;Even for free it stunk.
0;I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of. All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.  After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it. I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it.
0;"Well. We went here.\n\nWe were greeted by 2 peppy and upbeat cute 20something girls. We were expecting that to be the case when we were sat.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI am not lying one bit when I say, we waited 18 minutes and not ONE person came to greet us, serve us water or even acknowledge us.\n\nWe left after waiting 18 minutes for someone to come over. When we walked out the same 2 girls said, \""bye, thanks for coming. How was everything?\""\n\nI literally walked out the door with my friend as our other friend filed a complaint.\n\nThey did NOTHING to get us back to eat there, NOTHING.\n\nThis happened around 2-3PM this past Sunday, 7/9/2012."
2;The cool thing about this place is that they hand pull your noodles to order. They have 5 different varieties of noodles, and you can watch them pulling your noodles, if you are in to that kind of thing. I am. \n\nWe stopped in for dinner around 8, and it wasn't too crowded.  We started with the Pig Ear and eggrolls as appies.  The eggrolls were pretty typical for a chinese restaurant, kinda blah.   I couldn't eat the pig ears, because, uh, I just wasn't in the mood for pig ears. Yeah, that's it.  Of course, the platter came to the table with a HEAPING serving of pig ears. We ordered a small, so I can't imagine what the large size looked like. \n\nI had the spicy noodle with beef in XO sauce, and my guy had the spicy noodles (vegetarian).  The noodles had the perfect chew, and the sauce was really good. I would recommend the XO sauce, the spicy sauce was good, but the XO was just better.   I would prolly hit this place up if I was still in Arizona.  It was one of the better meals I had while I was there.
3;"No matter the size of a city, there are some services that are just hard to find, and when you do find them, are they affordable??? The Fit aka De' Fit, is the latest and greatest in alterations and custom design in the North Central Corridor (just South of Bethany Home Road on 7th Street, East side of the street). Dennis and Randall the proprietors are wonderful people; however, it is the exemplary work done by Dennis and his crew that has me taking everything I've wanted repaired in the last five years! redesigned, hemmed, restitched, reinvented! and I am just delighted with the craftsmanship and work that has been done. With the special now of 30% off, for less than $100, I have a whole new set of outfits that would have cost me five times as much money. For anyone that has those classic, expensive, well-made items (any clothes horse knows what I am talking about) that has a little tear, or the zipper needs replacing, or hem repaired, or some other repair, and you hate to give it up because it really is a nice, timeless piece, I highly , highly recommend you take that item to The Fit post haste!"
1;"I had a very similar experience to Allison G. (review written on 9/16/2014). I went in to collect my money at My Sister's Closet at T&C today. I approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what I was there to do. I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, I took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. They were decent labels (BCBG dresses, Coach purse, Elie Tahari skirt, Cache leather skirt, Italian suede blazer, Banana Republic skirt, etc.) and what I received in return in cash was $55. I asked Jenny (sales person) if I could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to Jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). It was because it was an item they had priced under $25. \""It's in the contract\"" Jenny so gruffly explained. So when taking your clothes for consignment I highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. Apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. Be cautious and informed before doing business here. I've had my account there for years and I've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. Jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. Bottom-line: Doing business with My Sisters Closet feels bad. I will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. I'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that I believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it."
2;This movie theater is ok. I like how they show international movies. I came for A Filipino movie but I also saw posters for Bollywood movies as well! I'm a fan so I will be back for that. The ambiance ain't much but the picture quality was good enough. Snacks of course didn't have prices but I'm sure it was an arm and a leg.\n\nIt was really quiet when we went no rowdy people talking through the movie. But if Was also 1:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. So overall an ok experience will be back if they show more international movies and at $6 for early birds, I'm there!
1;The only reason this place does not get one star is because the food did not make us sick. The Bellagio buffet was rather disappointing for our entire group. We went for dinner and it was $30. We waited 45 minutes in line on a Monday night to get in which we figured would result in great food. Wrong! First our server took forever to get our order. She seemed to have no way of knowing when we arrived because she first went to 2 tables that got there after us before getting to ours. However that's not why I'm rating the review bad. The crabs legs didn't seem so fresh and the buffet had a rather mediocre selection compared to the other buffets we visited. The desert selection was rather plain and neither of the two ice cream machines worked. I tried the house Merlot and it was horrible. The Kobe beef had an awkward taste to it and none of us took a second bite. To make things worse for the entire hour we were there our server never picked up our previous place or refilled our water. Talk about bad service. \n\nWe all agree not to visit this buffet on our next visit. We expected much more from the Bellagio.
2;I've been a fan of New Seoul since I moved to Madison. \n\nThe bibimbop is very good. The pulgogi is also very good, but could be cut up a bit more before serving. The portions are a bit large for chop sticks.  The kimchi is very good! I am not a huge fan of the various stir-fry dishes they offer. I had the chopchebop once and have never had it again since. The other stir-fry dishes are OK, but I'm a fan of the bibimbop and will probably only ever order that again. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant leaves something to be desired. The bathroom is often dirty and awkward to get to. The service is usually good, but sometimes the turn-over of the staff seems a bit high and the quality of service suffers. All in all, it's a good place and not too pricey.
1;This place has some potential. They could update the inside a little bit more, have the servers explain a little bit more about the food types and flavors (get into the food more for newbies)  and it would be much better.\n\nGot the steak and kidney pie here (never tried it before since I heard it can taste like pee) but it was really good - no weird or off flavors at all.  It was delicious with the onion gravy, but the mashed potatoes were luke-warm and just so-so.\n\nThe kid's options were really limited with sausages, shrimp, fish and chicken strips as the only options.  I don't know any kids who would like these choices other than the chicken strips, which were greasy and not very good.\n\nI asked if they had hamburgers, but they didn't.  Unfortunately the ranch was very odd tasting. I guess the Britts don't understand the American icon that is buttermilk ranch dressing that you can get at any U.S restaurant.\n\nIt also seemed a little awkward in that they expected you to know what all the food flavors and types were rather than getting into it and promoting their unique type of food.\n\nWe bought some snacks from the British store but all in all it was just okay not sure if we will be back.  Servers need to get excited about their unique food.
0;I had them twice now (about 6 months apart) and actually ordered the same items (as their photos of their other items werent very appealing).  \n\nI ordered their grilled cheese with hot dog/sausage.  I liked the idea of the sandwich more then actually eating it.  You would think after eating it the first time and not enjoying the grease of the oil coating my mouth, that I wouldn't subject myself to eating it a second time (even if it was 6 months apart) - I blame my fiance! \n\nI rather make this sandwich at home where I can control how much oil/butter to use just to make the bread toasted... toasted bread does not mean you need enough oil to grease your mouth and your fingers...
3;After all the years of coming to Vegas and for one reason or another ending up at Caesars, we finally just decided to stay here.  Caesars is kind of the center of the Vegas universe.  They get big names at the Colosseum (ok, Celine Dion and Shania Twain, doesn't thrill me, but they seem to pack them in), they have the forum shops (high end mall), a high end spa (Qua), top notch restaurants  and I suppose you can gamble here too :)  Caesars is the kind of place you can walk in one day and not leave until 3 days later.  That is good and bad.  It has it all, but it is also incredibly large, with a complex floor plan and it takes a lot of hoofing it to get from one end to the other.  \n\nNow, one of the reasons we picked Caesars this time is they didn't have resort fees.  I, like everyone else, detest the useless resort fees that Vegas has begun shoving down our throats.  Caesars didn't used to charge them, however I heard as of 3/1/13 they will be charging away - so be forewarned!  \n\nWe had planned to do the spa and had heard the Augustus Tower was the the newer of the buildings and the spa is in the same tower so we thought we were being smart by booking a deluxe room there. Plus it has it's own check in desk so you don't have to wait in those long lines at the main reception area.  At any rate, they decided to upgrade us (yay!), however we got put in the Palace Tower.  Now we had the single nicest room I have ever stayed at in Vegas, but the PT is SO far from everything I wished I had brought more comfy shoes.  \n\nThe Palace Tower suite (2802) we got was on one of the Penthouse floors. The bank of elevators were way out of the way so they weren't busy and you had added security of needing a key to get to the floor.  The suite itself had 3 full bathrooms w/tvs (which was totally excessive), wet bar, desk, sitting area with TV, dining room, a bed room with a King size bed, a couple of arm chairs, another TV and then of course the double closets, jacuzzi spa and 2 person shower.  It was insane!  I mean, incredibly nice! The only complaint (other than the walk) was that there was zero view.  We basically could see other Caesars Towers (this isn't that big of a deal though).  \n\nI would definitely stay at Caesars again. It has it all!
4;My only place to go for Chinese food. Sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic, but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is! \nThey have a fantastic tofu bowl (Hot and spicy bean curd) which is perfectly spiced! Others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed. \nIf you're looking to be snooty about your Chinese food, go somewhere else. Otherwise this place is perfect.
3;Oxtail soup, oxtail soup, oxtail soup.
4;I never write reviews, but use yelp for everything. This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review because my experience with regards to customer service was beyond anything I've had from a company. \n\nI found SCC on yelp when trying to find a cute little birthday treat for my girlfriend's birthday. I called to get advice on the best flavors, and they were so helpful on the phone. The same day, I placed my order online and they called me the next morning to make sure everything would be all set in my order...because the cupcakes were part of a surprise for my girlfriend and were to be delivered when we finally drove into town. \n\nFirst, I put the wrong date on the cupcakes, and they went to deliver them as per my request. When I told them I meant for them to be the next day, they were so gracious about it. The next day, I called SCC to let them know an update on our driving into town so the delivery could be just right. The girl delivering was even texting with me to make it that much easier for me!!! finally, they delivered to my hotel, and the 12 cupcakes were BEAUTiFUL! We had 4 Lemondrop, 4 chocolate wasted, and 4 sexed in the city. They were incredible! Everyone loved them. We're STILL talking about them and its been almost two weeks. \n\nSCC even followed up with us via email after just to see how they turned out and make sure everything went well. I would recommend this place to everyone. You'll be so happy with the cupcakes and even happier with the service. I was very impressed. \n\nThank you again, SCC!!!!!
1;Only place I've been to that messes up your order twice. I have been coming here for years now and haven't had any major problems just a few mix ups here and there but this time was a little aggravating. I ordered a simple omelette and the order is messed up, no big deal. I send it back and the waitress was happy to make a new one and apologized which was good...BUT when my new omelette arrives it was messed up again! They had forgot some ingredients and the way they presented it looked like they threw it together recklessly. The hash-browns were soggy and drenched in oil and the omelette was dry and crumbled apart from the first stroke of the knife. All in all was a pretty frustrating experience.
2;I visited the Waverly for the first time last night, and I will definitely be going back, should I find myself nearby and in need of a drink.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way unless there was a special event, but if I lived within a couple of blocks I would definitely drop by from time to time.  The space itself is really great, full of small corners that are both sheltered and open to the rest of the space, on multiple levels. The music playing wasn't too loud, was varied and just good overall background music.  The ceiling is beautiful, covered in wooden slats arranged in a geometric pattern, so if you visit, be sure to look up!  \n\nI didn't experience high prices like other reviewers have mentioned.  Granted, we went on a Sunday evening (special specials perhaps?), but the special of pint of Boreal for $5.25 is quite reasonable to me, for such a nice location.  Perhaps the other drinks are more costly?  They didn't have a price list or menu, so I didn't see what other drinks cost.  Or perhaps I've come to accept that drinks at a bar can get pricey.  If I want to drink cheaply, I drink at home :)
0;The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.
4;Dear Jeff, you've converted me. \n\nI have been in a makeup rut, and slightly (okay, very) homely looking lately so I went in with the hope of finding a new lip gloss or foundation, just something to make my face worthy of looking at. I was blown away with the service I got tonight. I'm really not one for sales associates in stores, in fact, I usually run in the opposite direction and pray they don't see me. Jeff caught me though and I'm happy he did. \n\nHe took his time and helped me find what I was looking for, made me feel comfortable telling him how average I was feeling, and made sure I walked out with all the tools and make up I wanted to face the world. He didn't sell me on anything I didn't need, simply made sure I had exactly what I wanted. Sephora is lucky to have him and I will definitely be back there because of him! \n\nThey use this face scanning machine thing that matched my skin tone to brands that could match my color, then he worked through my skin type and the finish I wanted and price range I wanted to stick to. Jeff tested a few options on my face before I decided on a foundation I liked and then he did my whole face. I got matched with a brand I have been walking by for years. I sure do feel pretty right now. \n\nI've never had service at Sephora like this before and was happy I walked into this one tonight.
3;Awesome bakery but mostly I come for the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut coffee.  They are famous for their cranberry toast which I have to admit that I have never tried.  But other breads and delicious desserts keep me coming back. Nova supplies a lot of coffee shops uptown and I am delighted to support local.  Their campy sitting areas (in and outside) make me feel so mellow and relaxed - it is a great place for a book and a cup-o-joe!
1;"I go here at least once every two years whether I want too or not. It usually is not, but I go. \n\nToday was one of those days.\n\nWe arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.\n\nThe young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the d\u00e9cor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.\n\nOk so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.\n\nOur server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude. \n\nI ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.\n\nI like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something....."
2;Great casual Japanese option on the strip. Only Con its a little on the pricey side for casual Japanese food. It has a large open dining area with floor to ceiling windows that face the strip. Great for people watching! The menu has a wide range to choose from sushi, ramen, etc. My favorite menus items were crispy cod & pork shoulder steam buns. For dessert my 2 favorites were the doughnuts (tofu,sweet potato,rosemary) and soft serve (coffee, pop rocks, nori, carmel). Definitely order together for a great pairing!
3;When I first looked up the Firesky Resort online, I was really confused about the various room options.  Let me just tell you - except for very few exceptions, all of the rooms are the same.  All rooms are about 400 sf and you either get one king sized bed or two queen sized beds.  The variation in price of up to $50 per night is solely based on the view.  There are 5 buildings that surround a pool, lagoon and courtyards in a U-shape.  As you can imagine, there are rooms facing these facilities and some rooms facing the parking lot.  Even if you want to save money, DO NOT get a room that faces the parking lot.  It will feel like a motel.  The rooms that face the facilities are all pretty much the same and there's no real reason to pay extra for the pool view or lagoon view rooms.  In fact, those rooms may be noisier and have less privacy due to the amount of traffic from other hotel guests.\n\nIf I had a dog, this place would be heaven. Dog-friendly hotels are not as common as they should be and even those that are tend to put all of the dog owners in the old/nasty part of the hotel.  Not the case here - dogs ruled the resort and I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the free wine reception every evening from 5pm to 6pm.  Let's just say that I got my money's worth.  We stayed 3 nights and each of us got 2 glasses of wine each evening. No, it's not the best wine but who cares when it's free.\n\nThe firepits are also very cool but there's a limited number of them and they are always in high demand.  I also love that there's self-parking all around the hotel so you can leave your vehicle close to your room for easy access.\n\nThe hotel is good but not perfect.  For example, one day we were out from 9am to 3pm and when we returned, the room was still not made up.  I found that to be inexplicable and unacceptable.  I had to locate housekeeping to clean the room.  When we returned to the room 2 hours later, the room was clean but the maid had put 2 identical toothbrushes next to each other.  We had left one on the left side of the sink and one on the right side.  It's pretty stupid for someone to move them so we couldn't tell which one was whose.  When I called guest services to ask for new toothbrushes, they took forever to deliver them to the room.\n\nBut the overall experience was fine.  The hotel doesn't look as amazing as the website shows (but does it ever?).  We ended up paying about $150 including tax for 3 adults and considering the amount of wine we drank, I think we got a good value out of it.
0;A girlfriend and I came here after seeing their Groupon (13$ for 20$)....when we arrived the restaurant was packed inside and out, but the hostess seated us very quickly. \n\nWe were super thirsty from too much pool/champagne time and it felt like days before we even got water (I would guess 15-20 minutes..which is still quite a lot). After we ordered it took another 45 minutes or so for the food to come out- again, pretty crazy since most of the options are breakfast themed. How long does it take to cook an egg?\n\nI had the chicken salad sandwich and Mexican soup..the soup was so salty it was almost inedible, but compared tot he super super bland chicken salad sandwich,. I guess I was happy it was at least seasoned. There was so little chicken salad on the sandwich that after taking the top peice of bread off, then the bottom, I literally had 2 bites from each side. No exaggeration. Someone had taken the time to dice the apples and other ingredients into perfect tiny cubes, which shows tons of effort...but the super small portion given and the fact that it wasn't seasoned made all that work seem pointless.\n\nMy friend had the corn beef hash..she left most of it- absolutely no seasoning again. It was the blandest corned beef hash I've ever tasted. She also had a Chai tea- again, no flavor, so she was dumping sugar and such into it trying to pep it up. \n\nWe spent another 15 minutes trying to get the bill- then did the universal My Tab Is Sitting Halfway Over the Edge of the Table so the Waitress Will See it Move...and she still didn't see it, so I had to flag her down. \n\nI would say she was friendly, but overall poor service for the long wait time. By the time we got our plates, most of the restaurant was empty, so it's not like they were in the middle of a rush.
2;"This is a pretty small dog park, with only one area for all dogs backed up next to a baseball field. My husband and I used to go to this dog park all the time when he lived over there, but now I only go occasionally when I choose to bring my pup to work and we both need a break for lunch. The people have always been nice, but the grounds have not always been kept up.\n\nI understand that it's a dog park and it will get messed up from time-to-time, especially in the summer, but a little upkeep would be nice. They recently \""remodeled\"" it, but I don't see much difference, besides them reseeding the grass and taking out grass in half of the area. Not sure why they would take out the grass, as now it is dirt/mud/sand, and your pups are SURE to need a bath once you leave. \n\nI will come back to this park because it is the closest one to my work, but other than that there is really no other reason for us to come here. We have driven past this park to go to Chaparral Dog Park because it is much nicer, although we would prefer to come to this one because of proximity. Oh well!"
1;If you are the kind of person who likes pushing people out of the way to get to a shirt or if Black Friday is your Superbowl, then this is the store for you.\n\nGenerally depending on what time and day you go, it may or may not be insanely busy. For some reason I always show up when there are not so many people. You can find some good deals here if you look but the merchandise if always changing and that is not always the case. The shoe section is what grosses me out half of the time I go here because at least at a thrift store they throw out shoes that are extensively worn, smelly and stained. Here they will sell them to you in the name of it being a high end brand. I saw these tennis shoes that were worn with mud and I thought that someone had taken off their shoes and left them there and shoplifted some other ones, but they were selling them!\n\nI usually do not like shopping because I do not like people to get too close to me and I do not like children suddenly darting in front of me or scaring me by popping their face out of a clothing rack. To say it ineloquently, people will be all up in your grill here. Seriously there is chaos at this store to be had. Be sure not to trip down those stairs.
2;They have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for. Typical ham and roast beef! It was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they can't stop eating.
3;It is almost impossible to mess this show up and the Mandalay Bay show did impress. Admittedly, the New York show is hard to match so my perception is heavily biased against the LV production.\n\nThe show's production quality was good, again, a notch below the NY production, but still impressive. The acting seemed a bit flat during the first Act but certainly picked up during the second Act. It may have been an off night or a slow start. I do not want to undermine the efforts of the talent but that was my impression. Notably, the performances of Kissy Simmons and Buyi Zama (Nala and Rafiki) filled the theater with beauty and strength. They, individually, made the show worthwhile. I still laughed and became emotional during the show, so the cast did create an engaging show.\n\nI would not deem this show a reason to visit Vegas but if you are there, I would check it out. The theater is not huge so there are great seats to be had for good prices.
1;"What I hate, when I have to shop at this particular Future Shop, are the salespersons: they will be insistent to come and ask you if you need any help, or even give you their unasked advice when they see that you have a product in your hand and are reading the information on the boxes. If I want an advice or have a question, I'll go to you, sales guy; otherwise, just leave me alone!\n\nIf you know what you are buying, just put some earphones and go straight to the alley where the products you want to buy are: otherwise, the salespersons will just constantly annoy you with their attention, trying to make a commission out of you."
1;The wait was really long for dinner. I got the falafel plate and the hummus was overly salty and more of an applesauce consistency than a hummus spread. The flavor wasn't great. they were out of the spinach pie. The falafel was really dark and super spiced. Too strong of a favor for me. The salad was the highlight of the meal but not enough to keep me coming back.
2;"Came here for Sunday brunch buffet. They were super busy, but their service was superb! As you walk into the restaurant you are in awe of the awesome view of the Bellagio fountain. The ambience is amazing, it feels like your about to have high tea. You don't feel like you have to rush and grab all the food you can possibly stuff in your face. Just sit back relax and grub.\n\nThe food was good, but it didn't blow my mind. They had a good variety of food. They offered an omelet station, hot soup noodle bar, oysters (they were really good!!!) lobster egg benedict, bacon, dim sum, tuna tartare, sushi, everyone gets one piece of Peking duck (one of the best items), hand rolled chocolate truffles, choc fondu, yummy mango sorbet. Well you get the point. There were some really good eats, but most of them were okay for the price. You're really paying for the ambience, when you dine here. \n\nIt's a great place to spurge when you're in Vegas.\n\nI'll be back...when I win big. ;)"
0;My wife and I tried Nimbus for the first time tonight.  All signs pointed to this being a potential new go-to spot in our neighborhood.  We were hoping for a place with good beer, interesting food choices and a fun atmosphere.\n\nInstead I rate this as my worst dining experience of 2012 so far.  We walked over from our house and when we were seated we asked for water.  It took 5 minutes to get it and the water glasses were dinky.  Hello - this is Arizona!  We need something other than kid-sized glasses of water.  \n\nI ordered a happy hour martini and it was undrinkable.  After sending ti back, I ordered an oatmeal stout that tasted like flat Coke.  My wife had a blonde ale and she chose not to finish it (very unusual for her).  \n\nIf we hadn't already ordered dinner, we would have left at this point.  The buffalo chicken pizza was decent but very greasy.  The fried zucchini was inedible.  \n\nTo top it off, there was a networking event happening on the other side of the dining area.  Our pizza arrived at the same time that the event speakers began to use their mics to broadcast their message to the entire place.  I was treated to a diatribe about diabetes during dinner.  While this is a worthy cause, it was totally obnoxious during dinner..\n\nThe food is overpriced, the beer is mediocre, the happy hour menu is limited (no burger - really?) and the ambiance is horrible.  \n\nNeedless to say, we will not return.  Word to the wise - if you are looking for a good happy hour, Ruth Chris is just around the corner and has amazing values and a great patio.
3;Have I ever been to smashburger? No. And now, I can say I have. So this place is neatly located in the stonecrest area full of restaurants and all your south side 5 second drive cravings.\n\nMy brother advised me to make my own burger. And I took his advice and did just that. I ordered an egg artisan bun, aged Swiss, tomato, lettuce, grilled onions, an egg, and mushrooms topped with spicy chipotle sauce. And of course some smash fries. How was it, you may ask?\n\nWell, this place is definitely place on my list to come back to. The burger was juicy, and with all the condiments loaded on there it came out pretty neat. I think I could've had more out on it, but I didn't want to try my luck with a burger that topples over to the point where it isn't a burger anymore. My philosophy: it's okay for mission burritos, no good for burgers on overloading condiments. \n\nThis place was a quick meal with a good amount of seating. With a feel of old school dining mixed in with the new. Pick up a menu, go to the counter, order, and sit down for your masterpiece (or a default burger) to come greet your burger cravings. \n\nOverall, this place is worth looking into if you're into burgers and a little freedom as far as creating what you want to taste. This place will be on my list if I'm in town and looking for a burger.
3;Every time we visit Vegas we HAVE to make a stop here, Yeah we have Amoeba (we live in LA) but I prefer a smaller setting where I wont feel like I'm having an anxiety attack because there is so much to choose from! I like the little novelty Items they carry and you can find some great gems if you look hard, I like how cheap the dvds are.
0;They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!
3;Went here for my 3rd time. This place is great specially if you're wondering the fashion show mall and you suddenly realize you starving, and you just know the food court isn't what you had in mind...\n\nToday I got both of the specials- swordfish and the lamb (both awesome) I say,...always order the specials at a tapa place- rarely will they let you down!\n\nFYI if you want the happy hour half off tapas you have to be sitting at the bar in order to do so. Which is kind of stupid, but that's just how it goes.... the menu is smaller but hey if you want to save some that's an idea.
2;I've heard alot about Round Table from Californians.  At first I was shocked that they charged $20 for a large pizza which would feed about 3 people.  For less, you can go to Dom Demarco's or Grimaldi's.\n\nBut I have to say that the Chicken and Garlic was quite tasty.  The creamy garlic sauce is really addicting.  I think it would be awesome if you get a side on the side to dip your pizza in - kind of like Papa John's.\n\nWhat I like is that the crust on the bottom is crisp and the body of the crust has the nice chewy texture.  The crust experience was quite unique for a chain.  The leftovers were even better the next day.   My method is to nuke it for 30-40 seconds and finish it off on a cast iron.  It provides the same experience you have when eating there.\n\nI'll be back for their Mon-Sat lunch buffet.  Without the use of a groupon, I don't know if i would go back outside of the buffet especially when I believe you can get much better value and experience at Grimaldi's or Dom Demarco's.\n\nBut the pizza here was still really good.  3.5 stars.
2;Sometimes, you really want sushi but you just aren't revenous enough for AYCE.  Enter Kobe Sushi Bistro happy hour.  \n\nFirst of all, this place is huge.  It's thebiggest sushi joint I've ever seen.  The decor is very nice.  Pretty lanterns and pendant lights.  \n\nWe were seated, and a bit overwhelmed by the 4 menus to choose from: happy hour menu, AYCE menu, cocktail menu and roll menu.  \n\nWe decided on happy hour.  Beers and sake are buy 2 get 1 free, rolls (approx 45 to choose from) are 50% off, sushi is 30% off, and apps (tempura, teriyaki, potstickers, salads are 50% off. \n\nWe had 2 beers, hot sake, 4 rolls, potstickers and baked green mussels. Bill was $51. \n\nThe standout was the johnny roll.  Highly reccommended.\n\nKobe won't be my go to spot for AYCE but I would definitely return for happy hour again.
1;After working a nine-hour shift, rushing through a quick shower, and driving for five hours to get to Vegas to meet up with my girlfriends, we stumbled into Cafe Bellagio haggard and famished.\n\nService here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.\n\nSo how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.\n_________________________________________________\n\nSide-note:  I received a nice message from Mark H., the customer representative, offering me to give them a second-try.  I'm flattered for such a gracious offer and I admire they're business integrity on trying to bring the best service possible.  It shows great work ethics and I respect that 100% but I must decline.  Definitely noted though and very cool of them to try and kiss and make up.
0;So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!
4;Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!
2;"We came here after a failed breakfast attempt at Bouchon (who serves lunch at 10:30 anyway?). Yeah, it's a glorified version of the Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThe hostesses seemed bothered that they had to actually earn a living by seating the likes of us; I actually think that they rolled their eyes when we approached. Conversation seemed forced, perhaps some requirement of Grand Lux (So, where are you guys from?), rather than genuine curiousity. \n\nI can't believe the waiter actually suggested the breakfast buffet. $15.95 will get you eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit and yogurt *yawn*. After previewing the buffet, I told the waiter that I preferred something 'not so basic'. I asked his opinion on the chiliquiles and the huevos rancheros. He said that the chiliquiles were good, but an Americanized version. \n\nI ordered the huevos rancheros. Freaking delicious, I tell you. The sauce was spicy and the black beans, onions and bell peppers were a fabulous addition. \n\nThe waiter was helpful at first, but disappeared before our meals arrived. What the heck? \n\nDamn you, Bouchon, for stopping breakfast service at 10:30!"
2;Looking around town for Jin's chicken and fish which wasn't in its normal Francis location we found this spot. Fulfilling after bar chicken/fish sandwiches. Would never go here for a meal but it's a perfect after bar spot. I got a chicken sandwich which was basically two chicken fingers drenched in Franks Red Hot, mayo, tiny lettuce piece on a thin hamburger bun. Did the trick for what I wanted.
0;We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight (after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting) she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back - with or without my daughter.
2;This location is okay but not as good as the one in Litchfield Park (gets 4 stars). \n\nI live half-way between both of them and depending where my errands are at in Goodyear/Avondale I end up at the two different ones. I have eaten their food at least 20 times:\n\n-Rolled chicken taco special\n-Chile Verde\n-Carnitas (way better at Litchfield)\n-Chorizo burrito\n-Carne Asada Fries\n-Enchiladas\n\n\nIt is my understanding this location on Estrella is run by the son of one of the Partners. He needs to be in his store more! Depending who is on shift, the food quality varies so widely. And the heavy set dude at night on the drive-thru needs to quit if he is so unhappy. \n\nThey need to take notice because the Ramiro's down the street has new management and they have greatly improved and will give this location a run for it's money.
4;Very Ono! We ate Kalua Pig tacos, Huli Huli Chicken Burritos & Pulehu Beef Bowl.  Makes me feel like home. Definitely recommend!
1;"I really wanted to like this place, I have liked several of Wolf Gang Pucks other restaurants, but I was quite underwhelmed.   I ordered the 12 dollar Cesar salad to start, the slad was very plain, lettuce croutons and dressings.  The dressing was overly sour for my taste.  My husband had the white bean soup, it was very very bland.  I had the Penne Pasta Carbonara, Smoked Bacon, English Peas, Mint, Black Pepper.  The bacon was really mushy and fatty, the sauce tasted just like any white sauce I could buy in a bottle.  I was really hoping the dish was going to be awesome but I didnt even eat half of it.  \n\nAnother member of our party ordered the House Made Thick Noodle Pasta alla 'Quattro Passi', Sausage Bolognese, Cream, Basil, Parmesan.  His exact words were, \""this isnt bad, but I can make hamburger helper that tastes the same\""  Not a good sign!\n\nMy husband had the pepperoni pizza, you cant really go wrong there!  I wouldnt go back to this location, but like I said I do like his other restaurants."
0;I came here thinking the food was going to be decent from all these good reviews from fellow yelpers. I've come to the conclusion that every yelper from North Vegas has really bad taste in food or they're stuck in an area with atrocious food and they THINK places like this is actually good.\n\nI started my meal with Falafels. Incredibly salty. They pressed the idea that everything is homemade at their location. Why isn't the chef or the cooks tasting any of the food before they're sent out? Don't order this unless you like making funny faces because the salt is overwhelming.\n\nI ordered the filet tenderloin wrap and my date ordered a chicken skewer a la carte. My wrap was pretty bland and had barely any pieces of meat. It was mostly filled with carbs. My date's chicken skewer was dry. The best thing that came out of the kitchen was the vegetable skewer that came with the chicken skewer. \n\nIf you want to get a really good chicken skewer, go to Crazy Pita. If you want some fresh falafels that are truly made to order fresh, go to Sababa's on Durango / Desert Inn. \n\nThis place sucks. Wont come back. Haven't found a decent place to eat in North Vegas yet......... Running out of options ....
1;I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\n\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!
4;A+++++++++++!  Oh my GOODNESS this show is amazing.  My boyfriend and I have seen this show twice so far, and both times were equally enthralling.  I've loved the Jabbawockeez since ABDC, and I actually cried at the end of the show the first time we saw it.  The second time, we were with my boyfriend's family (four 30-something adults) none of which had even heard of the Jabbawockeez- and they LOVED the show.  It's entertaining the whole way through, no downtime at all.  They do a beautiful job of exciting different emotions through out the show.  It's genius, beautiful, and stimulating.  They do an excellent job of incorporating the audience as well, so I hope you're not shy!  We'll go back again for sure.
4;Been there twice now and both times the food and service were excellent! The Sushi quality is fantastic and the variety is very good. If you like wasabi ask for their fresh wasabi!
2;Burgers are fairly good, albiet considerably overpriced considering that it doesn't include any sides. If you want fries, you'll have to order those separately. Thankfully, the spiked milkshakes are delicious.
1;Just had these guys out to inspect our A/C before the heat comes for the Summer. I had purchased a Groupon last year but never used it, these guys still honored the Groupon and took care of me. He gave me the estimate of repairs/replacement parts and seemed very honest. Anyone who lives in the South West knows that A/C companies have the upper hand when your stuff breaks. I will definitely have these guys out every year for a checkup\n\nUpdate 22 Mar 2013: So the rental company had their contracted A/C company come out and they guy said everything is fine, doesn't need anything that AR Heating & AC said.... Which is disconcerting because I felt I could trust the both companies but one said it's good to go no repairs nothing and AR said it need $300 in repairs. Guess my comment above about A/C companies having the upper hand was true. Rating downgraded, get multiple inspections/opinions! I'll be having a 3rd company out to make the final decision.
1;Five...five...five dollar foot longs. This song is very catchy indeed. However the footlongs do not catch my taste buds for long.(no pun intended) Do not get me wrong the bread is fresh and so are the vegetables. The cold cuts? Hmmm not so sure. The grilled chicken pieces they use for the sandwiches, I do not trust. It looks like soy meat. I know it is only $5.00 but for the amount of money I spend on four subs I cold buy sandwich ingredients from the grocery store that will probably last me a week. Better quality too.
4;Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience. This is a hotel that doesn't need to copy any other hotels.\n\nI recommend this great experience to all. Oh yea, lots of good looking people here...hehe.
4;Flip For Me is AMAZING!! My daughter has been there over two years and loves it! The coaches and office staff are great!
0;"Fuck. This. Place.\n\nI bought two Amazon Local gift certificates to use here. The first visit, we weren't brought any silverware or condiments. After five minutes of our food sitting getting cold, I had to walk up to the server station and fetch them myself. No one refilled our drinks the entire time. The signature crab stew was bitter and nasty. The steamed blue crabs are a ridiculous ripoff. What little meat they contain sticks to the shell and shreds apart making it maddeningly impossible to eat.\n\nAfter that lovely meal, we still had another gift certificate so we gave them another chance. This time we were looking to sample the crab cakes. After not being greeted by the hostess and having to initiate contact, we finally were seated. And there we sat, ignored, for 35 minutes before the jackass waiter approached our table. With no eye contact, the first words out of his mouth were, \""So you ready?\"" We stood up and walked out."
1;While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours.
2;Ahhh buffets... pretty good I guess if you want to gorge yourself.  I wasn't totally in a buffet mood when I went, so needless to say I got a little grossed out by the aggressive behaviour going down around the steamed crab leg tray.  We went on a Sunday night, and it was swarmed with people, so they have got to be doing something right!  Tin Tin has a wide variety of chinese dishes, steamed crab legs and oysters, lots of shrimp, a sushi buffet, and the classic kiddy table with some french fries and mac and cheese, and an ice cream machine - which scores BIG points with me.  All that being said, I felt like everything I ate (except the ice cream) had a slick of oil over it.  The sushi table had some decent looking stuff on it, but I didn't dig in. \n\nWill only return when I'm famished.
4;I love Vosges.  Why?  Because in addition to the chocolate with curry and chocolate with wasabi and ginger, they have a bacon and chocolate bar.  Yes, you heard me, they have concocted a chocolate bar with bits of applewood smoked bacon in it.  Granted, it tasted a little weird, but that kind of inventiveness deserves 5 stars.\n\nBoth times that I visited here, the staff were really good about giving samples of their merchandise.  They always have a featured chocolate bar with samples - the first time, it was the Barcelona bar (almonds and grey sea salt) and the second, it was Mo's Bacon Bar, the aforementioned treat.  According to them, the bacon bar was brand new and they had just gotten it in.  We also got to try the Naga bar, which, along with the Barcelona, was the favorite.\n\nWe ended up getting two boxes of milk chocolate truffles (9 pieces for $25) as gifts, the Barcelona and Naga bars, and a quarter pound of their caramel toffee.  I really wish that I had sampled their Black Pearl (wasabi and ginger), as well as the hot chocolate.  I also regret not buying the bacon bar, which probably would have made for some fun sampling with the family back home. \n\nA great chocolate store with some slightly kooky, exotic confections that work surprisingly well.  I only wish that they had an outlet in San Francisco so that I can try out more chocolates and have a steady supply of their delicious toffee.
4;When Brak first arrived in the Valley of the Sun back in 2004, he fretted over having to find a new barber shop.  Back in SoCal I'd been going to the same shop for years and really liked everything about it.  I did some searching online, and came up with Floyd's.  It was nearby, and how could a joint named Floyd's Barber Shop not be awesome, I thought to myself?  Well, I really like Floyd's.  Great gang of barbers, 3 of whom have been there the entire time I've been going.  Good local chit-chat while getting the noggin buzzed.  The only thing missing is Opie wandering in for a trim.  Then again, ole Opie is balder than a cue ball nowadays, so I don't expect I'll bump into him anytime soon.  If you're looking for a good, old school barber shop, with friendly folk, very reasonable prices, and consistently good haircutting, no matter which chair you land in, then look no further, Floyd's is your joint.
1;2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nNothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.\n\nThere's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger. \n\nSimple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild? \nAnd every single combination and permutation in between. \n\nHubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball. \n\nWith that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform. \n\nAnd that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.\n\nIt's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.\n\nI've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement. \n\nSeriously. Think about it. \n\nThey both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef. \nThey both offer burgers with different types of meat.\nThey both offer customized toppings.\nThey both offer multiple types of fries.\nThey both have milkshakes and floats.\nThey both serve beer.\nThey both cost more than in & out. \n\nThe last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention. \n\nThe food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill. \n\nSeriously? \n\nYou're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen? \n\nSome nerve. \n\nThere are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point. \n\nUnless you are here to try the Rossini on an expense account meal, don't bother.
2;We made another lunch stop at Braddah's Island Style on our most recent vacation and once again shared a Kalua pig burrito with seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, lettuce and tomato. Even though management committed the unpardonable sin of running out of cilantro, our burrito were still very good. The staff seemed less friendly or engaged than on our first visit just 6 months ago.  For example, no samples were offered, tables had not been bussed, and bottles of sauce were not put out until a good 10 minutes after a customer made the request.  A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate.
0;I use to love this place, would come here all the time!! \nthe last time i went there  tho was na totally bad experiance \ni was pregnant at the time and was planning on doing my nails with my mom and sister as well, well due to my pregnancy i needed to use the restroom so as soon as i walked in i went to the nearest girl and ask her if i could use the restroom. The girl told me that i had to do my nails or purchase something in order for her to let me use the restroom!! well agreeing to do my nails she then let me use their not-soclean restroom!! well i was furioused and walked out as soon as i was done lol wtf i dont know if these chineese ppl know their rights but a pregnant woman has the right to use any restroom otherwise they could press charges!!
1;In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was.
0;Stopped here Tuesday morning for bagels and coffee. The place was filthy. Tables had food debris and floors and windows disgusting. But the worst part were the flies. I had to cover the part of the bagel that I wasn't eating so a fly wouldn't land on it. There was also a huge flying insect (not sure what it was) that almost landed on my husband. We ate fast and left. Never again. They need to clean up or shut down. One star because the bagel tasted good.
3;I love this location because it's right on my way to work... I had a breakfast sandwich here once that I wasn't too fond of  so now I just get the regular bagels - the spinach florentine is my fave. \n\nThe lines can get kind of long here in the morning, but the staff so far has done a good job not making everyone wait too long. Nothing worse than having employees who don't give a rat's ass, so I'm glad it's not the case here. In fact, everyone has been really nice here always saying good morning and smiling...at least every time I've been here.
3;"Nice place, my boyfriend raved about it so he decided to take me here. I love good backed potatoes and he said this place had huge potatoes and great food. I should be fair all I ate was the potatoe and some corn bread; but i can't help but feel I was ripped off. We both got potatoes, cornbread and two drinks and paid $30. I can't believe that. $30 for potatoes? Granted it came with meat on top but hell i could've done that. \n\nNow taking that into account I have not tried the BBQ as of yet. Looking around though I saw some of the others food and it looked amazing. The place overall has a nice homey and friendly atmosphere. When you walk in the place smells delicious and the place was so busy. I will be back if only to try those ribs I saw someone else order they looked great. The cornbread and honey butter as well are my favorite. I would like to take just a pan of that stuff. \n\nOverall I feel it was pricy for what I got but the food was still good. The place seems jumpin in the sense of customers coming and the food from specualtion alone looks worthy of a 4 star rating. Just wish it were a little cheaper but you pay for quality right. I'll be back soon."
2;I go to Vegas a couple times a year  and I stay at different casinos .  This last time in September I stayed at the Excalibur.  We have stayed here before.  We always enjoy this casino, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the price is reasonable.  This last time we left a tip for the maid who was cleaning our room. She left us a thank you note, which I thought was very thoughtful of her.  It is the first time anyone has written us a thank you note for a tip. Her name was Clementine and she did a wonderful job.
3;Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!
0;I can't even rate this bar due to the very upsetting experience. I use to go to this bar and brought 5-8 people every time. We love the food and I even enjoy gambling. The servers have been wonderful. But I went in with my boyfriend on Sat Feb. 11th, 2012 to have lunch, drinks and to watch the UNLV game. When we arrived at NOON every table and chair was reserved with half of the place empty. So a large well built gentleman came out of the kitchen and I walked up to him and said, if every place is reserved can you help us find a place to sit. Without asking us, he turned to this couple and said can 2 people sit with you? I do not mind sitting with people, but it was a set of seats that had our backs to the large TVs and we had to look across the room to very little tvs. We asked for another area and he gave us attitude. VERY VERY BAD service.... apparently they did not want my business and word of mouth has hurt other businesses that I have gone too. Too bad they do not know how to treat their customers and a great idea would be first com first serve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2;This was our first foray into Vietnamese food since moving to LV.  What can I say?  It wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything to write home about.  If I could I'd give it a 2.5.  I decided to round up for now.  \n\nWe tried pho, bun, and spring rolls.  We liked the spring rolls (though the sauce was a bit watery and too salty).  The bun (vermicelli) was pretty good.  The pork was nicely seasoned but they skimped on the shrimp.  The pho broth felt a little light...could've been more flavorful.  But the worst part?  It left both my husband and me feeling dehydrated and with dry mouths.  Sure signs of MSG overdose.  Yuck-O!  :(
4;What a difference good customer service makes!!\n\nFor my second visit I took my with daughter with me. \nI called before heading over to make sure they had room for us. The person who answered the phone was friendly, improvement right off the bat!\n\nWhen we arrived we were immediately greeted kindly & given an option of 2 tables that were open. The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :) \n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas. The lemonade was a big hit :)\n\nThe entire experience, like the fries, was perfect & we both can't wait to go back!
4;"My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did. \n     I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. \n   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.\n   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)\n  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.\n   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. \n   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem. \n    I will definitely be back!"
0;I called a week later to see if they could update my gel nails & they were rude on the phone and were going to charge me way more than any other place.  I won't be going back there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3;"I must give it up for Wolfman. As a former resident of California, their pizza is no more \""California\"" than is Taco Bell, but I imagine they're going for the comparison to California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nWe love the White Wolf. I also enjoy the pizza with the chicken, spinach and fine herbs. The crusts walk that line between thick and thin very well. I know that folks have crust preferences (NY style, Chicago style, etc), but this might be a crust which embraces all pizza eaters.\n\nThe appetizers are great for handling a very hungry table anxiously waiting for the pizza, though not really all that memorable. \n\nThe individual-sized salads are really enough for two to split, and the large size could serve three or more. If it is just the two of you, ask for the individual size and an extra plate, along with the dressing on the side (they often have a pretty heavy hand with the dressing).\n\nNIce folks serving, though the speed of delivery of the food can vary with no discernible reason (e.g., restaurant not really busy, off-peak time, etc). Good selection of beers, and some nightly specials (check their website for details of that night's deal). Seating available outside, which can be a nice touch on a good evening."
0;Poor food quality. Not worth the price.
3;I actually ordered food for delivery from RoadRunnerFood.com so I can't really speak to the service, except what the driver told me.\n\nMy husband and I ordered the Lamb & Assorted Vegetables w/Szechwan Hot Sauce In Pot (yep, to go), combination fried rice, Cold Mixed Crystal Noodle, Shredded Carrot & Cucumber, and mouth-watering chicken (that was all the information on the menu but it sounded interesting).  For the lamb and cold noodle, can you tell I'm just copying and pasting from the online menu?  I'm not typing all that crap out.\n\nWe ended up getting the combination fried rice, mouth-watering chicken, and two of the lamb dish. No cold crystal noodles.  But it's all good because the lamb is about $10 more.  \n\nThe lamb dish and combo fried rice were so good!  The mouth-watering chicken comes cold, which I'm good with.  But it has a lot of tiny bones, which makes for annoying eating.  And it made my tongue feel funny so I may be allergic to it.  :) Note to self... avoid vague dishes.  \n\nOur food took a while and China Mama apparently aggravated our driver a little bit.  But China Mama's defense, the mayor showed up.  However, that was after we placed our order so I don't think the mayor was the problem.\n\nI noticed some reviewers had issues with the service here.  If you love the food but hate the service, you might consider using Road Runner Food and get the food delivered.  Just make sure to tip the driver well.
0;One star for the service but 5 stars for the dole whip. Extremely slow service! The server kept filling orders for people who came after us just because we bought the pineapple boat. Took 13 minutes to get our order. Sadly I won't be coming back. Id rather go back to Disneyland.
2;"Short Review: It's a great place to have a lunch date or a business lunch with 1-3 other people. They have quite a few lunch specials and the cost is about $10 per person. \n\nLonger Review: The Resturant is currently located in the Sunset Corporate Center next to a tattoo shop and paintball store. It's super easy to miss the entrance if you don't look hard. However, once you get in, there is plenty of parking in the front and back. \n\nThe sign outside reads, \""Japanese/Thai Food\"", but when you walk in it has the atmosphere of an eclectic 1800's living room combined with a pan-Asian bistro. The music consisted of jazz renditions of the billboard top 100 and the kitchen (which is in plain view) added a burst of white to the grey and black dominated dominated environment. \n\nThe menu, which is in a nice 3-ringed binder, had a good assortment of food options. The lunch menu was straight and to the point and made for quick ordering. The food is inexpensive and so are the drinks ($1 for a Thai Iced Tea - nice!). \n\nThe food presentation was fantastic and combined with the flavor, it far exceeded the price. Absolutely worth the money and then some. I tried the Spicy Chicken and Ramen Noodles, the Teriyaki Beef Bento, and the Crispy Pork Rice Bowl. The Ramen was good, but oily and when it cools down it sticks together. The Teriyaki Bento was excellent and it came with soup/salad/white rice/two pieces of California roll sushi/and broccoli. \n\nThe Crispy Pork Rice Bowl surprised me... It came with pieces of fried pork and a large fried egg cooked medium on too. It was the best out of those three for sure. Lots of flavor and came with the same sides as the bento box minus extra rice. \n\nOverall, the experience was ok. It's not a place I would bring the family and it isn't a place I would go to that often. The food is great, but the atmosphere is confusing. The chairs are super comfortable, but you won't be there long enough to really enjoy them."
3;I finally got to see what all the hype was about. Went there an night about an hour after they set up. They were out of their specials so (kalbi and pulled pork sliders) so I had to make due with their angus burger sliders.\n\nThey were pretty good, similar to what you expect from an angus slider at a place like burger bar at Mandalay bay, but probably a bit cheaper. The main thing is the novelty of the idea of following around their truck and eating on a curb side with your friends.\n\nThe only downsides were they were out of their specials which I wanted to try since while their angus sliders were really good, they're also good everywhere else you go to get a gourmet burger. The other was the really long wait (about 30 min) to get the food which in my opinion is a bit long to be waiting to get food from a truck.
1;Simply just not impressed. I've had better Chinese food buffets for less. The only reason I went out of my way to the city of Henderson was because of a groupon I received.  I will say, however,  that the place was very clean and the service was good.
2;Its good yogurt to get your sugar fix but its not the best that i have tasted. I love how it looks inside though and the name is quite cute!
2;"Holy SMOKE, this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy.  It made the dining less enjoyable.  We went for the famous \""Steak Special\"". And I must say it was pretty darn good.  The green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well."
1;I've gone here about twice only because I really wanted to some grits and a biscuit.  Neither were that great.  The grits:  overly salted, lumpy, and too runny.  The biscuit: decent enough as far as biscuits go.  Didn't disappoint but didn't delight me either.  The potatoes:  way too salty for my taste.  \n\nMaybe I'm sensitive to salt, but you guys really need to monitor that. I know it's breakfast food but at least be mindful of the sodium. I had no problems with the service on each of my visit, but I'm unlikely to return again.
2;We liked this place but it wasn't outstanding. My wife and I both had sliders, one of their specialties, and it was good. Not great. \n\nWe ordered their adult Mac and cheese too. The waiter commented on how that's what they're known for. We got our sliders. But we never got the Mac and cheese. \n\nWe were full by the time the waiter checked on us. I told him to cancel our Mac and cheese order.
0;"Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more .. If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order \""Everytime\"" I'm patient I have been in the service industry... Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you... Never again ... I'm finding an Einstein bagel..  This place sucks!"
3;So this place was under another name from another fame, but the owner is the same. (ha, crack myself up).  The food is way better, the space is way roomier, They have like 100 TV's and the fact they didn't kick me out on opening NFL Sunday because I was on my roller skates makes mama very happy.\n\nI plan on going here for all the 1pm games for the rest of the season. They are kid friendly too.  Can you say no babysitter needed, take 'em with ya.  They need their own roller skates tho.\n\nFOOD: recommend the pretzels/mustard - the cooked kind.
2;I havent been to many clubs but out of the ones i have been this one I was not a fan of. I just was thankful that my friend's friend was able to get us in for free for her birthday. It was so hot inside, by the time we walked down the stairs and over to the bar area i had sweat running down my neck and i had not even started to dance. There was one thing i did like most of all and that was when the guys from star wars came out and did a little party dance/celebration and shot out confetti. I had one drink and after that i refused to get another drink just because it was very overpowering(just not my thing). I still had alot of fun and enjoy getting out and celebrating my girl's birthday!!!! But heck I live in vegas so why not try and see what all the clubs in las vegas have to offer.
0;Usually I get just average service. Once, i saw  The hostess wearing sweats and a hoodie. She looked tired and left her post for a good 4-5 minutes.  Not presentable at all. . But i went with my boyfriend last month and we received the most unprofessional service in our whole restaurant eating career. Our waitress was talking bad behind my boyfriend's back while he was in the bathroom. Not only that but she rushed him while he was deciding what to eat. We understand it's busy and it may be stressful, but you are still the waitress and you are still supposed to be providing a service. There are no excuses. We were kind enough not to complain to the manager, but we did not tip. Would not go there AGAIN.
3;Good food, but plan on eating a hot dog later. It was very expensive for the portion size.  However, everything tasted amazing!  We had 2 to 3 tapas per person and each tapa had maybe 3 to 4 bites each and cost between nine and $12.   The cocktails were some of the best we had on our trip.   If you are in the mood to spend $20 on a gin and tonic I highly recommend their signature one.  This is definitely a splurge meal and I would recommend the restaurant just be prepared that the portions are a little bit on the small side.
1;If you like ungracious and inhospitable environments with ungrateful, unaccommodating management, this is your place. There's no place around that shows less appreciation for an over $1,500 dinner bill. The food is good and they've done a nice job designing the ambiance, but there are a million places that have that in Las Vegas. Service should be of the utmost importance, and it's not close. I will recommend their signature cocktail, The Barrymore, however, because it makes it easier to deal with the staff.
4;This is by far the best place to have your eyebrows done period...I have been to so many places for waxing and a few for threading. I have had some ok and some awful experiences. I have a small scar on one eyebrow that seems to ruin every professionals day.  I am always nervous letting anyone near them...I once had someone take the end off and try to sell me makeup to cover it up...well Marci is so amazing that I drive 25 minutes across town to see her and will not let anyone else near my arches!  I have been seeing her for about a year and a half and will not go anywhere else! Imagine my devistation when she had her last baby early...let's say it wasn't too good for my brows..lol...I love that it's a small family business and they are so customer service orientated it's amazing because many business take their customers for granted... Not here! 5 star all the way!! So inexpensive I cannot believe that they offer coffee and water at each visit. Well worth the travel time for me!!!
0;Terrible service!! Rude manager! Lost a customer for life And the manager didn't care
1;Nothing exciting. Tasteless guacamole. Would have expected more flavour in a Mexican restaurant.
3;Sunday afternoon before heading back to the airport was great. Jack & I met some really nice guys. Good mix of people and the tacos were good and cheap. Fun place!
1;Tried it since most reviews were good, but should have listen to the unsatisfied honest reviews, it took 2 agonizing hrs. in line to reach the table which is well set and clean but wait you have to get in line again yes again for the food this time, service was good but after lining up again for food it was just okay not worth the long lines. Sashimi was not that fresh, Todai is better reasonable price & no lines. Oysters were sweet but the shuckers were slackers they were too SLOW on opening up the well liked oysters and they were shucking the tiny oysters not good, crab legs forget about it lacking in taste too low of a quality. I DO NOT recommend to spend 2 hrs in line for a so..so food.
2;I walked in just to check how the restaurant appeared and the atmosphere was just not what one expects. So I just wanted a quick snack and I ordered the fruit salad.\nIt comes prepackaged and consists of a sliced apple, a few grapes and 5-6 pieces of walnuts on the side and there is some chemical laced dressing.\nThe product did not match the advertised pictures . I am going to try this again in LA and see if it comes with three grapes and a quarter of sliced apple with no greens. But I must add the price is less then 3 dollars and does fill you up. The dressing is called low fat yoghourt  but i could read some odd chemicals that I do not like.\nAny why this restaurant at the particular location is best to avoid.
1;We landed in Phoenix and were surprised to learn that there was a restaurant that had Madras in its name. Furthermore it had really good reviews that only added to our hunger. So we decided to give this place a shot for our dinner!\n\nWe ordered sambar Vadai, masala dosa and chettinad Gobi masala dosa. None of the dishes lived up to the name Madras!!! The Vadai was really very hard and it seemed like it was made in the morning (at least we hope it wasn't any earlier than that). The dosas were a little sour and that is a clear no-no for anyone from madras. The service was slow because they were understaffed that day.
4;We had a fantastic meal at The Fig Tree this past weekend. Nicole was our sever and she was extremely knowledgable about the menu and offered great suggestions in terms of wine pairing. She's been there for seven years and really knows her stuff. We started with warm bread which was served with whipped butter and a garlic spread. Word to wise- go easy on the garlic. It's potent. Then we shared the scallop appetizer and the foie gras- both were very good. I started with a Pinot Noir and she had a Pinot Gris. We loved the spinach salad with the quail egg and bacon and maple vinaigrette. We added the goat cheese, because you know, it's goat cheese. What shouldn't it be on? She had the filet- huge, super rare, awesome. I had the duck. Loved the duck, but wished for more sweet potato and fewer beans. I stuck with my Pinot and my wife ended up with a great Grenache which was the best of the evening and surprisingly inexpensive. For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake. Rich. Dark. Just right. In all, we had a great evening and will definitely return. Tip: sitting upstairs puts you close to the restaurant's only restroom. The down side? Steps. Lots of them.
3;"Brought our two girls, one of them who is six years old wanted to donate 10\"" of her hair to Locks of love. \nWe only had to wait for a few minutes, and since it was slow. They brought them both in very quickly. Our 6 year old wanted a drastic cut, they cut over ten inches off. She was nervous at first, but they made it fun for her. By the time they were finished, her hair looked great! \nOur 8 year old wasn't so brave! But she did have about 3 to 4 inches trimmed. It was funny to watch these kids get their hair washed and scalped massage, they were totaled zoned out! \nBoth of their hair cuts were great, we had a good time, and we will probably come back here for their hair cuts in the future."
3;Good boba shop located in the asian market in Chandler. They have a host of different boba flavors, with the option of having tapioca boba or jelly boba. They offer it as boba tea or the blended form kind of like an asian frappuccino. I'm a fan of the taro, its smooth, and its purple.\n\nThe food selection isn't bad either, I've only had the chicken potstickers and it was tasty.\n\nThe place is pretty small, most people go in and out for their boba fix.
0;my girlfriend and i have been there twice, and twice we have gotten upset stomachs, there were green bugs in the menus, friendly people, but get passed off to a different person both times, stay away from this place
1;Rather disappointed, ordered the kare-kare, although the meat was tender,vegetables were soggy.  The lechon kawali was pretty good, came with the gravy dip and rice. Perhaps will give them another chance due to the A/C not working on one of the hottest day of the year 122 deg,
4;"We were promised a \""dining experience\"", and that's what we got!\n\nA group of 6 of us came here, and we were instantly charmed by our server, Michael. He recommended a custom \""dining experience\"" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. Food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but Michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.\n\nSome of the highlights:\n\n- yellowtail tacos\n- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce\n- sea bass (I don't eat sea bass, but my friends were raving about it!). The Peruvian corn that came with it was excellent \n- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans\n- a sushi platter with spicy tuna, California, and shrimp tempura rolls\n\nSushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. And every dish was amazing! I definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their NYC locations."
3;I came here with a friend on my past trip to vegas. (Wish I could go back already) \n\nWe were walking around the Forum Shops at Caesar's and came across this place. We were distracted by the delicious looking pizza everyone was eating. After looking at their menu, we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe sat at the bar since it was just us two. We got there during happy hour and totally didn't realize how late it was.. It was about 4/5pm but it only felt like it was 1 or 2pm.. (Time difference was so hard to get used to at first) Not to mention that they weren't even crowded. It is usually crowded at places during happy hour back at home but I'm glad we didn't have to deal with crowds. \n\nAt the bar we ordered some drinks to try.. When in Rome right? Or in this case, Vegas. I got their Frozen Bellini which was like a slurpee.. it was awesome! If you know me, I don't like drinks that have a strong taste of alcohol and I like prissy drinks lol. Not to mention I don't really drink. But when you're on vacation.....\n\nWe ordered the butt load of food for two people.. Tomato Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms, Fried Calamari (a must for my friend every time we go out) and a pizza. It was all so yummy. \n\nService was great and I thought that the price was reasonable for happy hour. But then again when you're on vacation you don't really look at the price =/ \n\nHere's the link to their happy hour menu: \nhttp://www.trevi-italian.com/pdf/menus/TRVI_happ.pdf
1;Our server at CarneVino was fairly rude. For a group of four we ordered two entrees, 4 appetizers/small plates, a dessert, and a couple glasses of wine  He did not seem to like the fact that we weren't all ordering 3 course meals and that we were sharing everything.  He definitely acted snooty about it.  After he realized that we weren't going to go crazy gorging ourselves on food, we were basically ignored the entire night and had to flag him down if we needed anything.  However, the bus boy, runners, and hostesses were all great.  When we finally got our bill, it stated a suggested gratuity of 20%.  No matter how awesome the service, I don't think that they should put that on the bill, let alone when you get bad service!  It's especially off putting when you're already a generous tipper to begin with.\n\nThe food was good, but unfortunately it did not make up for the service, so I would not recommend going to this restaurant.  With all the other options in Vegas, you could definitely get great food with great service elsewhere.
1;We were told great things about this restaurant from a family member and thought we should make reservations for dinner during our stay in Las Vegas.\n\nOverall, our food was not worth the price tag. We asked our waiter for recommendations on wine, appetizers/salads, steaks, etc. His knowledge of the menu didn't seem to be what I was expecting and it seemed like he didn't know what the popular items at the restaurant were. \n\nOur salads were nothing over the top that we couldn't do ourselves. Honestly, every steakhouse I've had a salad or soup at is always one of a kind. Take it from someone who ate her fair share of steaks in the South! All of our steaks were overcooked from the temperature we asked for. Our wine was more dry and not as sweet as we had expected. I felt that our dessert might have been the only good part to our meal, which wasn't recommended by him, but we read through popular reviews. \n\nIt was very disappointing to have the level of service that we did and I had hoped it would have been more accommodating to someone who was a vegetarian. I know what you're thinking, why would a vegetarian show up to a steakhouse. However, you'd be surprised how accommodating many are willing to be for someone who would like a little more than just a side dish. While I don't expect chefs to create a new meal, to make an added effort/detail to a side dish would have been nice. It also didn't help that our waiter seemed like he was rushing to close up our bill rather than having us enjoy a nice meal. \n\nOverall our experience, was a complete bust. We've experience better steakhouses in Vegas that have been much more accommodating and notable for their service and food. I definitely wouldn't recommend this steakhouse to people in the future.\n\nI felt the reason they should get one more star is for extra effort in the complimentary glass of prosecco they served us for our anniversaries and taking picture of us from my iphone.
2;Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this
1;I was really excited about staying in the new city center.  I've been to Vegas several times and normally opt to stay off the strip due to fact that most of the reasonably priced hotels on the strip are extremely old so when I found a under $200 rate at a new modern hotel I was geeked!!!\n \nUnfortunately that ended fairly soon. \n\nROOM: Great looking, very modern & spacious, yet there is no real direction as to how everything works. Took me 15-20 minutes to get things working properly and even then I had several lights that I could not get to turn on. also the only outlets are at the front of the room by the tv. No night stand outlets so if you are like me and like having you phone close to you at all times, charge it during the day else be forced to get up out of bed in the middle of the night to answer it.\n\nFRONT DESK: Very friendly yet sometimes inefficient.  Had to call several times about getting my lights fixed. Internet wouldn't work properly and they kept transferring me to the wrong people to fix it. Called for an extension cord so that I could work comfortably in my bed b/c the outlet is soooooo far away and she talked to me as if it was the silliest thing they've ever heard.  Let how odd is it that I would want an outlet near me so I could work from my bed or answer my phone!\n\nCONCIERGE: They just seemed confused. The last time I visited Vegas I used the monorail to get around the strip. Being that the city center is so new and I asked about trains, buses, monorails to get back and forth.  Th e1st concierge told me about the free shuttle to get to Bellagio. The 2nd told me about the RTC bus. The 3rd told me to walk to MGM grand and get the monorail. None of them actually got me to where I was trying to go.  I just ended up taking a taxi because they confused me even more.\n\nELEMENTS: This is their 24 hour one stop shop although looking from the outside you would never know this.  When walking by it looks like a clothing shop advertising the Elvis show but they have everything. I loved it until I went to pay and couldn't find a register that was open.  When I finally saw an employee standing by a register I sat my items on the counter and she pointed at a closed sign that was closer to another register. Didn't even speak or try to get me some help.  I was flabbergasted! \n\nPROS: Great vibe. Not at all casino-y lol Has a upscale feel. Nice location. Great food although lacks a cost variety. Cheapest cup of coffee in this place was $8\n \nCONS: Room has hair everywhere. I have no clue where it came from because my housekeeper was bald. My towels were noticeably dirty and one reeked of smoked.\n\nI like the feel of the City Center but I won't stay here again.  May try Planet Hollywood or the Cosmopolitan next time.
2;Took my dog to get groomed at barks & bubbles for the first time. I loved the outcome, and they put a cute bandana on him. He looked like a complete different dog!  And also they gave me 15% off as a recommendation. The only thing is he came home with a clipper burn on his testicles, which really sucks. A week later and he's still hurting.
3;My first trip. Located on second floor of the Cromwell. \n\nTips. This place takes reservations. Most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. Lunch recently began to be served. Lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. Dress code is enforced.\n\nExperience. At arrival we are greeted immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. Also confirmed and greeted at the front desk. She kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.\n\nOur server Anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. He was kindly insured we placed a drink order. We were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite beverage choices. Giada's Sangria with Brachetto and Fortunella 1958 with Don Julio were the drinks we ordered. Anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of Don Juilo and was substituting with Patron. Rare to find a restaurant out of beverage. Without Don Julio I went with my second choice Barbarella 1968 with Tanqueray Ten. Waiter respected and agreed with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink. \n\nDrinks were served and food order was taken without delay. Both drinks I would describe as a good balance with alcohol and freshly matched ingredients. Sangria was crisp and savory. Barbarella similar to a Moscow Mule was harmony of gin, ginger beer, fresh lemon and basil. Drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. Alcohol was not over powering either. \n\nAnthony made suggestions for the meal. We followed some suggestions and ordered others. We ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Pecorino Tartufo with Apricot Preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. Dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. Yum. Pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just magnificent. The components of pecorino worked well on its own and together. Harmony. \n\nMeatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory Marsala. Tender soft meatballs. Sauce was flavorful and one of the best I had. Tomatoes lightly toasted to maintain it's integrity. As a whole this was a nice antipasti. Pieces were good on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. This item is on their dinner menu and I would still order it. \n\nWe ordered from the sandwiches from servers suggestions. Muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and aged provolone. Similar to an Italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. Prepared warm from the grill, this is what a  sandwich should be. This sandwich pays true homage to the influences of Giada's family into the restaurant. Sandwich is served with choice of arugula salad or zucchini scapecce. Arugula salad was elected to pair with this. Lightly dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. I couldn't complain if this was the only thing I ordered. Between the muffuletta sandwich and arugula salad I think I could eat all day without feeling guilty.\n\nOther sandwich was the Lobster Roll with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. The roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. Ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. Nothing over powering just right and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. Paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strings. Not greasy but crispy enough with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the lobster roll. Lightness of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. Both light sides were good pairings. \n\nOverall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were great. Service was outstanding. Restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. The restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to Giada's family and California influences. I would make sure I had a reservation the next time I am out to Las Vegas. A must try if you like food. \n\nServer was very personal and knowledgeable of menu. Server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. It showed with suggestions. We enjoyed the meal from some suggestions he made and our own selections. Serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.\n\nOverall four stars for exceptions from a slight delay on the check to get to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. Five stars on food, service, and drinks. \n\nWe had plenty on our list of things to do for this Vegas trip and this is a definite return place for us.
3;Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!
3;I was skeptical when I heard that the Aladdin was being redone as a Planet Hollywood hotel & casino, but they've done a great job at sprucing this place up.  They put up chandeliers and a lot of other shiny objects, and they have one blackjack pit with go-go dancers.  The center bar is still hooker central, so if you need a hooker, now you know where to go.  I've yet to go to their club Prive, but I have eaten a few times at their buffet and consider it one of the best in town.  The new poker room is OK, and the mall has some great shops & restaurants -- H&M, Blondie's, and Hawaiian Tropic Zone are a few of my favorites.  Oh, and one time I saw Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore playing blackjack and snapped a picture.  Cool.
0;this place has teenagers running the place! Customer service is horrible! You are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you
1;Drove all the way downtown so my girlfriends daughter could get a few donuts. Not too impressive. They have a lot of donuts, but they only have a few different types/flavors.  I have seen larger selections at most grocery stores. That being said, I walked away paying only 4 bucks for our breafast. Not too bad.
2;Stayed here 11/15-11/17 and I wouldn't mind coming back. Paid a little over $300 for two nights, not too shabby, probably because it wasn't Comedy Festival time. The location is great which was very important to my club hoppin, heel wearin self. Like the other Yelpers mentioned, the bed was very soft, as if I were trapped inside a marshmallow. Decent eating options, still didn't get to try the Pho place but tried Kahunaville. The only thing I have to complain about are the surly workers but I don't blame them.
2;This is a nice mall with great shopping selections: Nordstroms (the only one around?! so weird!) Neimans, Bloomies, Saks, French Connection, etc. The thing I didn't get is why DID they build this mall? If you're a tourist shopping, you'll prob wanna stay on the strip, or go to the outlets which are 2.5 seconds away and have ALOT of the same stores. I guess I did see some locals but they were all teenagers hanging out, so again I figured ANY mall would do, not necessarily this fancy pants mall. Oh well. Would I go back? Maybe if the Nordstroms gets it $h!t together.
3;Biaggis never disappoints. The food is always right on point, as is the service, and lots of yummy wines/martinis. The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!
1;Food was not very good.  Used to be better.  Chicken burrito had good pcs. of chicken in it and nothing else. The red sauce on top tasted like ketchup!  I had to get it off, NG! \nThe Beef in the taco, yuk.   Chips and salsa were good.  Fresh cilantro was good at helping out the food and rice a little.    \nWon't go back.
4;Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.
0;Staff was like they did not want us there..\n\nwe had a golf tournament there this weekend-\n\nWe had a group of 9 foursomes, so 36 players, we have played there for 10 years. They had 1 server for 39 breakfast, the gal was nice and did her best but the management was so very unprepared.. some of the group waited an hour for their food, and never got food because we had to go tee off.. \n\nPlayed came off course and was kicked out because they had a wedding behind us.. Literally told to leave, The management was so disrespectful to everyone in our group.  I have been in the hospitality business for about 20 years and have never seen anything like this.. \n\n\nThis comes with my strongest recommendation not to come here and play.
2;I am just hoping it was an off-night in the kitchen.  Service has improved since my last visit.   The manager is always nice and attentive. \n\nAside from the sashimi, our meal didn't taste very good, maybe we didn't order well.\nThe miso tasted like it was made from a packet, the salad dressing changed since my last visit and was not good...like watered down ranch or something.  More disappointing were our entrees the spicy beef was actually very bland and the sauce looked straight from a bottle, like something you expect from a take-out only Chinese Restaurant.   I got Tom yum soup, which I am pretty sure was made a paste it tasted too concentrated and not fresh.  \n\nSo why three stars instead of two? I think their sushi/sashimi is above par, especially for the price.  If I come back I am just sticking to sashimi.
3;"You either \""get it\"" or you don't at marigolds. My mother, a visitor to our fair city, deemed marigolds to be too crowded at 1130 on a Sunday morning. She has never seen it at 930 on a Saturday morning. Once my parents initial shell shock of the hustle and bustle around us wore off, we were able to score some seats and wait for our breakfast.\n\nIf you know me, I am a Bloody Mary snob. That bing said, the bloody I had at marigolds was delicious. The mix and seasonings used in the mix were balanced well, and I could sense just the right amount of vodka without it being overpowering. \n\nBetween all of us that went out for my bday brunch, I must have tried just about everything. From the scones, to the daily scrambler, to the pancakes, to the French toast, to the quiche, to the breakfast Sammie that was on special that day, everything was great.\n\nMy qualm? The coffee. It was exceptionally bitter. And I am a lover of bitter and sour tasting things. Something was just...off. These things happen.\n\nWe got in, we got seated, we got served. Great bday brunch in an adorable, brightly lit restaurant."
0;Long gone are the days of Utopia\nI've checked out this nightclub on two occasions. The same DJ both times. Crowded, hot, rude people. Cheap thrills with the bubbles and confetti. Bouncers try to do their job but most of them come off as over the top aholes, themselves trampling over patrons. \nIf you want to  pay to have your body roughed up, sweat on, spilled on, and be treated like cattle being steered to the slaughter house, this is your place. \nEven if you pay a ridiculous amount for VIP treatment (getting to sit at a booth $1500-$3000 and purchase a $25 bottle for $400) you are bound to be sardine packed next  to enough dbags to last a lifetime. \nGone are the days of clubbers being happy, polite, and all with the same great energy. Forget about being able to sit, relax, and cool down when you have danced it up on a spacious well-designed dance floor without being smashed and squeezed to the point of suffocation. \nThe stairwell walk is grueling in heels and then not having a cool place to rest inside the facility? Incredibly inconsiderate of the designers. \nIts hard to enjoy good music, lighting , and dance when there are so many negative distractions around. \nI recommend XS if you are going for this kind of entertainment. More space, very few steps,  and better attitudes from the staff.
3;I've always seen signs for this buffet, but since it's a bit off the strip, it was always a bit inconvenient for us.  We decided to give it a try this time, and it wasn't bad at all.  \n\nWhen we first got there, the line looked a bit intimidating.  It went out the door, looped around the escalators, and down a bit more.  We stood in line and watched the Rio bartenders do tricks, so the wait actually wasn't too bad.  It went by pretty quickly, and we were seated quite promptly.  \n\nThey had a decent array of choices - from Asian to Cajun, crustaceans to barbecue.  My favorites were - of course - the crab legs and shrimp.  Those two alone made me a very happy camper.  The legs were NOT SALTED!!  Most buffets in Vegas salt their crab legs to preserve them.. but not here!  :D  Big kudos for that!  They were easy to crack, and super sweet and juicy.  I also really enjoyed the New England clam chowder.. yummy!!  \n\nAnother portion I really look forward to at buffets are the desserts.  Sadly, I was not impressed.  However, they did have gelato though!  For some reason, I was loving the cantaloupe and honeydews way more!  The strawberries were delicious too - add the chocolate syrup and you have a chocolate fondue!!   \n\nI don't know if I'd come back necessarily.. it is a bit inconvenient as I've said before.. but definitely enjoyed it while I was there!
0;These people butchered our poodle. If I could add a picture to show you how terrible she looks, you would think that these groomers had no formal education and I brought the dog to supercuts for $10 trim. \n\nWe will be taking the poodle to another groomer to fix her haircut and for them to shave the spots that Hap E staff missed. \nThe poor dog is sleeping underneath a pile of blankets because I'm sure it was a traumatic experience and she is exhausted. \n\nThe Rottweiler that we brought was fine, because she just got a bath. Don't go here. If there was a zero star possibility, they would get it.\n\nF rating and the business is run by a bunch of no-talent hacks.
1;Wow what a disappointment... We stooped in for some lunch and my wife ordered the meatball sandwich and I grabbed a burger and her mother had the chicken entree, first off the burger was dry and i didn't enjoy anything about it, very over priced for mediocre food to say the least, my wife's meatball sandwich was spicy and that wasn't ever in the description, my mother in laws chicken was dry and the bed of whatever it was severed on was just weird, bad food for outrageous prices.\nI didn't care for our server either, she was very snooty...
0;Worst cheesy breadsticks! I've ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this location's version was terrible! They were over cooked, cut in half  and with 50% less bread sticks than other locations. Barely any cheese as well.
1;OK, what is everyone else seeing here that I didn't?  Yeah, I went for a weekday lunch instead of for Sunday brunch but shouldn't it still be at least a good experience?\n\nOn the plus side, the physical space is special - lots of exposed brick, high ceilings, worn wood floors, lots of windows for natural light.  The restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday.  It is definitely NOT handicapped accessible.  The only access to the space is a very long, very steep flight of stairs.  (Even the server told us that cases of food, wine and beer kegs have to be lugged up those stairs, there isn't even a freight elevator in the building.)\n\nI ordered the potato bisque (a menu staple) and the chef salad special.  Our server forgot my soup and brought it out after she'd served my entree salad.  The meats in the salad seemed like cold cuts - in fact, rather than being served julienned or chopped in the salad, they were simply layered on - rounds pieces of cold cuts in the salad!  The ranch dressing was likely homemade but was runny in texture and bland in flavor.  My chocolate cake dessert was okay - but not $7 worth of okay.\n\nMy companion enjoyed the crab cake on top of an otherwise ordinary looking salad and she raved about the tiramisu.\n\nOur server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection.  She brought out two bottles, let my aunt try both and make a selection.  She even let the unchosed sample stay on the table instead of quickly whisking it back to the bar.\n\nParking is a private lot off of South Blvd - but it's very easy to miss the entrance to the parking lot - and once you miss it, you can't access it from any of the neighboring parking lots either!\n\nMaybe I'll try again with a Sunday brunch - but the experience will have to be world class amazing to erase my memory of this lunch.
2;"Decided to try this place about 2 weeks ago with a big group of friends. We let the server know ahead of time we were are trying to catch a movie in about an hour and a half, plenty of time to order and enjoy the food. The server was nice enough to let us know that there was a 25 percent off special going on tuesdays. \n\nMy boy friend and I ordered the deviled eggs and shared a combo plate. The deviled eggs were tasty with like these crunchy chicken things on top. The combo plate included two kinds of ribs, hot links, and choice of two sides. The mopped up ribs were really good and flavorful, whereas the dry rub were just ok. Hot links were good too. We chose mac and cheese and side of corn bread for our sides. The corn bread was absolutely fantastic. Mac and cheese was ehh. \n\nSo why the 3 stars? Well our server and the rest of the staff just seemed to be in panic mode. Initially when he took our orders, it seemed like he was having a hard time using their tablet system. They kept forgetting to refill our drinks. One of our friends had lemonade and he came back with sweet tea and said \""Please tell me you like sweet tea, because we are out of lemonade.\"" He brought us to go boxes that were too small to fit those huge dry rub ribs. Then when it came time to pay it seemed to have even flustered them more. It was like a 30 minute ordeal to pay. \nAnd of course we were late for the movie. I wish they just had more of a sense of urgency.\n\nThe food was good and we will come back to give it another try."
1;This place is good if you're looking for a cheep, filling meal on the strip.\n\nI had the Full Montague, a good sandwich, filling. I wouldn't say it was as spectacular as others have raved, but that didn't stop me from eating it three times during my stay in Vegas.\n\nThe comments about the service are spot on, whoever is running this place obviously doesn't know the meaning of customer service, or just doesn't care that the service is rude, unfriendly, and completely uncaring about the customer's experience. I would think a restaurant on the strip in Vegas would be ready for a high turnover of new business and train staff to welcome new guests and help them through the process, this was a complete fail. I was not welcomed as I arrived during any of the three visits, the staff didn't waste a single friendly or helpful word beyond what was absolutely necessary to complete the transaction, and I don't remember a single thank you for my patronage.\n\nI would recommend going, but save a buck and keep the tip for yourself, unless management/staff get their act together.\n\nAltogether a mediocre sandwich and bad service, but the price is good.
2;Being a huge fan of Scott Conant on Chopped, my wife and I made a point to visit Scarpetta as soon as we landed on Thursday night.  On the plane I joked that we better not get any sticky pasta, and luckily we didn't. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant has a great feel and it's in a great location at the Cosmopolitan.\n\nWhile the meal was fine, there was just no wow factor.  The black pasta with lobster was good, as was the veal chop, but it wasn't great.  \n\nI am glad we tried Scarpetta, but there are too many great restaurants in Vegas to visit this place any time soon.
0;All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so.
4;Best hotel in Vegas?  Yes.  Have I been to all the hotels in Vegas?  No.\n\nI've been to some and this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS.\n\nI want to live here.
0;do not book here !!!! cockroaches everywere! it looks old i swear it does not look like the picture ! false advertisement your better of staying in your car. i booked with them through a thrird party and trust me we decided to pay the cancelation fee then to stay there with cockroaches and a rude i mean rude ass old trailer trash bitter receptionist patti. this hotel doesnt even deserve a star. patti the receptionist is a bitch as soon as we walked in she didn't even want to look up our reservations. she didn't want to take my dads credit card because the name was shortened. she was also very rasist. never again this hotel should be shut down its just taking up space! do not book here once again. even the stupid manager had an attitude !
0;Cute, modern, pastel love-fest looking place.\n\nI requested a sample of the Carrot Cake, which was promptly handed over: white gelato, white spoon... and a black, curly hair.\n\nTruly, a Kodak moment.
0;"I got a deal through Groupon, so I thought, \""why not?\"". Going during the height of convention season, it was close to the Convention Center and the price was right. When I went to check in, I was immediately asked if I wanted an upgrade to a newer room for an additional $20 a night. No thanks. But I would like a room with 1 king bed as requested, not 2 beds as they offered. No problem! When I checked into my room, there were 2 beds... not a big deal - at least I had another bed option. One was so lumpy, I can only imagine that it had one of those egg crate foam mattress toppers - you know, to sop up all those bodily fluids. I opted for the one that had a huge lump in the middle, making it an uphill battle to stay in bed all night. Now, I've seen those news shows that go into a hotel room with a black light and it illuminates all the nasties... so I never go barefoot in a hotel room. Ever. Good thing, because walking across the stained carpet, my shoes stuck to the surface in some areas. Ewww!!! The light bulb was burned out in the only lamp in the room. The bathmat, while most likely clean, had a huge black stain on it, which in my opinion, warrants a replacement. The bathroom,  overall, felt a tad dirty. Grout needs replacing, the fixtures in the shower were loose, the shower curtain had seen better days. And what was that yellow stain behind the door? Hopefully I'll never know... If they were giving away rooms, I'd never stay here again. The only plus was that the customer service woman refunded my \""resort\"" fee (I used quotes, because really, can we call this place a resort?) The internet never worked in my room and that's really the only thing the fee was good for for me. Funny enough, there was a man checking out with the same complaints (down to the burned out lightbulb and filth). So I wasn't the only one. Back to the MGM for me!"
2;We were looking for a new place to get a burger in Charlotte. We both got burgers and ordered them medium with tater tots. The burgers came out well-done. It didn't bother me much, I just noticed. I assumed with it's name, the burgers would be spot on. The tater tots were heavily salted and basically tasted like thick potato chips. My first thought was to give this 2 stars, but something did stand out. This might be a great place to come and watch the game. Plenty of TVs. A big open patio complete with couches. If you are looking for a place to get a beer and watch a game with a group while also getting decent food, this may be your place in South Charlotte. We may be back come football season.
2;A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.
1;First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.
0;Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.
4;Though it's doubtless that The Roman Candle (TRC) has many delicious offerings on their menu, in my visits to the Willy Street location, I have never been able to get past the pizza. Their pizza is scrumptious, addictive, and just short of intoxicating. A magic balance of flavorful crust, sauces and toppings has been achieved. The incredibly rich, cheesy, and unique Alfredo Pizza must be tasted to be believed. And, I am now a believer...especially in the efficacy of using fresh, local ingredients to craft extraordinarily delicious food.\n\nIn my visits to TRC, I usually include the Triple Pepperoni Pizza. This pie is a carnivore's delight. It sports three different kinds of pepperoni which marry to give this pizza a savory meatiness that I've not experienced elsewhere. With gastric juices now flowing at Warp 10, I usually round off my gluttony with two scoops of Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream--all of which gets washed down with a Sprecher's Root Beer. However, a number of local beers and wines are also available.\n\nI'd be remiss in my review of the Willy Street TRC if I failed to mention their friendly and attentive staff. Food is prepared in a timely manner and tabled according to the customers' wishes. In my visits I have never been greeted by anything less than a smile and a cheerful attitude. The combination of tables and booths is adequate and the overhead music is kept at a comfortable volume. Prices are moderate.\n\nI plead guilty to ignoring other menu items that have been given the same artisanship afforded the pizza. However, in future visits, I hope to try some of TRC's non-pizza offerings.\n\nOne of the greatest pleasures of the human experience is to eat. Don't risk denying yourself the pleasure of The Roman Candle.
4;my buddy and i came here for dinner recently since it was close by to our conference hotel.. \n\nwe were seated promptly despite not having reservations and it was relatively packed house.. \n\nservice was prompt and friendly.. my buddy got the duck confit and i got the beef cheek bourguignon.. the execution was spot.. the duck confit was crispy, ducky and beautifully prepared... my beef cheek bourguignon was phenomenal.. really a simple dish.. but the beef was ridiculously tender.. the braise was rich and hearty.. \n\nall this was washed down with beer.. \n\nif i'm back in montreal.. i'd definitely head back here.. it seems like it was packed with locals
2;As close as this Walgreens is to our house, I rarely come here.  Don't ask my why, it's just never on my radar.  It's a standard Walgreens and offers the same layout and products that others have.  My most recent visit was just after Easter.  We dropped by here on the way home from Church to pick up some Easter Candies that were on sale.  I love the after-holiday sales where you can pick up stuff at big discounts.\n\nI'll have to drop by more often.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%
0;I seldom write review and so whoever is reading this must understand how bad the food was. \nI'm a regular customer here and the food is generally good and so I order delivery from S2YD a lot. However, the last time I made an order(Goat Curry) the food was close to untouchable. \nThe Styrofoam box in which the food came was dripping with oil. I ignored this, and on eating the rice I realized it was either not well cooked or that they had reheated what they kept in the fridge. Needless to say, I didn't touch the meat fearing for my life.\nThat was the last time I ever ordered from Jamerica - and its been almost 2 months now.
4;What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20. \n\nHappy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).  \n\nWhen we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!
3;I've been here probably 100 times in my 18 years in Vegas.  Never a disappointment.  Place is well priced ($20 for an inside out clean with tire shine) and my car is black and they make it look good.\n\nThere is a gentleman inside most of the time who is a shoe shiner.  His name is Clarence and he is a master craftsman at shining.  Shoes look great and he is fun to talk with.  HIGHLY Recommend him and the car wash\n\nNo machines in side the wash bay, dudes emerge with giant sheepskin mitts to clean your car.  I've seen lots of really fancy cars here too.\n\nSign up for their email club and get one email a month with a $5 off coupon you can use time and time again
0;Did I miss something? Was I not supposed to go to their lunch buffet? Because it was horrible. I was looking forward to trying the Wynn buffet ever since hearing about its rave reviews. Unfortunately it did not hold up to our expectations. Yes, it's a very cute and dainty place with its colorful fruit and flower decor. It's well lit and kept clean. The lunch variety was lacking and composed mostly of starches (pizza, pastas, stir fry). I was extremely disappointed. The only thing I thought was good was the noodle soup made to order and their gelato bar. For the money we paid, I was expecting some shrimp cocktail or ceviche. There was none. A bigger issue we came across was the fried chicken. It was inedible. It had no flavor and there was something off with the meat, like a bad after taste. We left unsatisfied and rarely do I ever feel unsatisfied from a buffet in Vegas, because at the end, the dessert bar makes up for it. Unfortunately, their dessert bar was sad as well. Boooooo.
4;We spent New Years Eve here! Great atmosphere, excellent food and friendly staff!
0;"DON'T BRING CHILDREN TO THIS LOCATION!!! I brought my very nervous six-year old daughter here. She even told the phlebotomist she was scared, but there were no words of reassurance from the staff. The phlebotomist didn't really say much to us at all except to ask if my daughter would like to sit on my lap, which she said \""no.\"" As soon as the needle was inserted, my daughter jerked back, and blood was everywhere. My daughter was hysterically sobbing as I was then reprimanded by phlebotomist for not having her sit on my lap. (I wouldn't have minded doing that, but she made it sound optional rather than critical when she asked earlier. If she had warned me this might happen, I would have gladly sat with her.) Again, there were no words to calm my daughter down or even a \""sorry.\"" She asked if we wanted to draw the sample on the other arm since we had collected no blood at this point. Meanwhile, my daughter is so hysterical there was no way I could have her work on the other arm. The phlebotomist made me feel like I was in the way and should get moving out of the office if I wasn't going to do the other arm. My daughter hyperventilated practically the whole 15 minute drive home, crying that she never wants to get blood taken ever again. In my opinion, the staff should be coached and trained on how to handle nervous children or even calm down someone who is upset. I felt like I had no empathy at all, and now I have to worry about my daughter having permanent phobias with needles. I'm never coming here again!"
1;I stopped in here unexpectedly.  I really wanted to like them as they are so close to where I work. I tried one of the daily specials, Champagne Raspberry (I think it was called).  The gal helping was very sweet and informative, but the cake was a little hard, dry and dense.  The frosting was super sweet and too thick for me, and had sugar crystals sprinkled on it.  I like frosting that melts in your mouth and does not crunch.  If I had noticed the sugar sprinkles ahead of time, I probably would have changed my order.  I'm thinking I should try it one more time, and this time get the dark chocolate cupcake - as dark chocolate truly is my favorite anything.
2;We had $50 of Food & Beverage credit to kill at the Vdara and Market Cafe was one of the few choices.  My tuna melt was delicious and my bf's egg, cheese, and bacon bagel was not.  These items took 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which is pretty ridiculous.  We also ordered some tea, coffee, juice, and desserts to hit our $50 mark.  Apparently pre-packaged items (like salami, ice cream, or canned beverages) do not count.
4;No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade.
2;We haven't found many lively places to have dinner on a Sunday night in AZ.  So we usually end up at Kabuki in Tempe Market Place.  Last Sunday, we ended up in Tempe Market Place again but didn't feel like sushi so we decided to go here.\n\nFor a sports bar, this place is surprisingly nice inside.  We were seated in one of the booth with huge screen, we ordered our food, and the order didn't take long to get to our table.\n\n*Spinach and mushroom quesadilla - pretty yummy.  it wasn't oily at all\n*Black N Blue - it was....interesting but a little too weird...the gravy was a little burnt and you really, truly have to love blue cheese.\n*Grilled Pastrami Sliders - pretty good.  again, it wasn't oil or dry.\n\n*Location = very lively\n*Decor = cool for a sports bar\n*Food = ok\n*Price = a little on a high end for a sports bar
0;Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...\n\nPassed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus
1;Flew into Vegas on a Thursday and was starving when we got here. We decided to give Diablos a shot. It was relatively cheap for Vegas standards and the food was ok. The service though was below par. Really long waits, pretty much no attention from our server. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food and sort of slammed the food down and left in hurry. \n\nI had the jalapino chicken tacos which were decent, and 1 beer. I was never asked if I wanted another...which I did.
1;Boy, I don't know what happened to this place.  It was good like the other Gritty locations when it first opened.  It's definitely gone downhill.  Service is lacking - we had to wave at our server multiple times before hunting her down for a beer refill.  When we received our sandwiches, they were disgusting.  My grilled buffalo chicken sandwich had an unusual (bad) char taste to it and so did the bun.  It took several hours/beverages, etc before the char taste left my mouth.  There was no sauce on it and the side of ranch was missing.  My husband's medium Gritty burger also had the same weird burnt flavor to it and so did his bun.  We didn't advise the server of our issues since we needed to get going and didn't have time to wait for new orders.  We ordered chocolate milk and they must pour syrup in it and mix it up - this time, the milk was white and the syrup was clumped in the bottom.  We have noticed a decline in popularity of this restaurant - there are fewer people patronizing this place then when we've visited for lunch previously.  Bring back consistency and this place will do well again since Sun Prairie lacks all kinds of dining options.
3;Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.
3;A client suggested this as a good place to meet for a business lunch and I couldn't agree more. What a sweet find! On a Tuesday, it wasn't packed, which meant we could actually have a decent conversation without any distractions. Our server was as sweet as pie and very attentive - quite an adorable man with an obvious knowledge and passion for Cambodian cuisine. \nEverything was very decently priced - I think my meal + coffee came out to about $13 and I was TOTALLY satisfied with my food. \nNext time, I'll do a dinner date with my manfriend because our friendly server informed us that the dinner menu is where the real traditional Cambodian fare comes out!\nOH, I forgot to mention - they do takeout and delivery, too! Yay!
3;You definitely pay for the view, was an above average meal. I got the steak and it was pretty good. We also got the cheese plate which was nothing spectacular. I reserved a table for us with a request to sit outside, upon arrival we were asked where we wanted to sit, I thought that was kind of odd. There was a bug crawling on the table during our meal and the bus boy came by as he was setting our appetizer down and killed the bug which I thought was kind of odd. \n\nView: 5\nFood: 3\n4 stars.
3;The Caley Sample Room is a gem in the western side of Edinburgh, with a loyal local following and plenty of folk who travel a way to get here. The food wins awards, the beers and drinks are varied and plentiful and it has the best table water in Edinburgh (stuffed with mint, cucumber and whatever else they think will help).\n\nThe architecture's a little odd, but that probably stems from its previous life as part of the nearby brewery. The exterior can seem a little uninviting and unfortunately it lends itself to smokers clogging up the doorway, but the pub opens up once you're in. The restaurant to the right has plenty of covers, set around heavy wooden tables that bring a feeling of tradition and quality. To your right is the rest of the pub, with a long bar that stretches into the distance. Good for a quiet midweek pint, or a busy Friday night, they host regular live music nights and other special events.\n\nThe staff know they're stuff about the menu and the drinks on offer, which is all you can ask. Fortunately I've always found them friendly too.\n\nIt's well worth your while calling in to the CSR if you're in the area - near Fountainbridge, the canal, Gorgie Farm and the other delights of this side of town.
2;A warehouse full of whiskey -sure, sounds like fun. A few of us dropped by Whiskey Warehouse after a late dinner down the street. \n\nWe arrived around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and, while it wasn't super crowded it was starting to fill up. The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college. \n\nWe were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside. \n\nI imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!
2;"This is a solid good eat if you are searching for fresh tasting sushi. I ordered the screaming \""O\"" roll and the cucumber special roll as well as the seared tuna in ponzu sauce appetizer. All of them were very good, especially the seared tuna. The staff are very accommodating too, our waitress was a little forgetful but her sweet personality made up for it. The reason they are not getting a higher rating is because we felt as though the table could have been more clean. The surface of the table seemed very sticky...just one of my pet peeves."
1;i don't get it - other Tesco's seem to have much better stock than this one. It takes an age to find anything with a slightly off kilter layout from Tesco's that has me all confused. The number of times on the way home from work, I've stopped in only to find that the item I am looking for isn't available here... but is at my local store. I guess my question really is, Tesco Superstore, Hermiston Gait, what is your point?
2;Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare.
0;DO NOT GO HERE.  We bought a bouquet for $50 that only lasted 2 DAYS.  I used to work in a flower shop and flowers should be lasting longer than that.  I am NOT HAPPY.  MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN
1;"Cannot recommend before safety standards are improved. \n\nPros: courteous, professional shuttle drivers who are punctual; office was helpful in rescheduling due to my delayed flight\n\nCons: Loose safety procedures. My single seat buggy lacked left foot rest, four point belt was checked only after I asked. Was not told which group to follow, turned out I was w the guide and two company mechanics, yet I was constantly left in the dust due to my groups familiarity and my sub standard buggy w reduced power. Trying hard to keep up, my buggy gave up half way up a slope the others cleared. I was told that some buggies were beat up so didn't perform well. Not one buggy had a raised flag; this combined w a group that weaved in and out, I lost the group often in the dunes. We were told to follow the guides path bc wavering just 10 ft could result in serious injury: on two occasions I lost the group and hit violent falls. Finally, when it's time to park, one of the staffs buggy rear ends mine, causing a not insignificant whiplash. All I heard was another staff jeer \""what the f r u doing?\"" followed by more banter among the staff. No apologies, as if rude behavior explained the \""it's all in good fun\"" attitude towards this potentially dangerous sport. \n\nI've done experience events w skip barber and Infineon raceway; all very professionally run and ran strict safety procedures. Sun Buggy feels run by frat brothers who believe the periodical \""r u having fun dude\"" is equal to safe and fun."
3;I don't like giving 5's, so a 4, nice to have a Guinness, and a Guinness stew. Wife had a Sheppard's pie and was happy. Should use real mash potatoes. Servings on the large size. The fish and chips could help feed the 5000. For Vegas not bad value. Good selection of beers.
0;"First to review, now the last.\nStopped by to see Hiro and Shige at \""Shiro Sushi\"" last night and there is a note on the door.\n\n\""Couldn't make it through the slow times\"".\n\nToo bad.\nHopefully we will find them elsewhere soon.\nTJ"
2;Pretty good place. Tasted fresh. I wish the shrimp ceviche was a bit more limey, and spicier. They are also kinda stingy on the toastadas lol, I had to end up using crackers to eat my shrimp . Fish tacos were really good as well. Overall, I will come back again.
0;Never eating at a Denny's in Vegas again.. I thought it was just the Denny's on fort apache and trop but I guess it's this one as well.. First of all the establishment is filthy! They need a surprise health inspection ASAP! My glass came out with lipstick on it so I asked for another glass and the server just looked at me like I ugh.. Okay!?! Then our food came out and it was swimming in oil.. Hmmm yummy! Then I notice hair in my food =\\  can you say gross! After that I completely lost my appetite.. Never again..
0;I booked this thru the online website of Paradise Found Tours which links to Grand Canyon Tour & Travel for $80 a person for the South Rim bus tour.  You can have them drop you off and pick you up on another day but that would require you purchasing 2 tickets.\nWe got picked up on a smaller bus and taken to planet hollywood to check in and get our bottle of water, coffee and small danish for breakfast.\nOur bus driver Earl was very rude and not at all friendly.  He determines who gets to sit where and was the bus Nazi.  I understand we are on a time crunch but he could have been more nice or bring on a tour guide that would be nice.\n1st stop was at hoover dam for a 10 min break and picture taking opt.\n2nd stop was at a truck stop with a Subways in Kingman City.\n3rd stop was a buffet lunch.  They sat us with another set of people so we would fill up the table of 4.\nThen we got to the Grand Canyon and made 2 stop was at two view points.  Each stop we were given 1 hour and was threaten they would leave us if we are not back.  They left 2 people at the first stop.  He dropped us off at the 2nd stop and went back to get the people left behind.\nAt lunch he was yelling at a single international guy that probably did not understand him very well.  They were missing 2 people and the guy walked on the bus by himself.  He was yelled off the bus to find his friend.  Then another girl on the bus spoke up that her friend was not there and then the guy was let on the bus.  Then the bus driver yelled at the lady for being late and told her to stick to her friend from now on.\nVery rude bus driver.  We did not get the 3 hours as promised on the website.  It said we get picked up later than other tour companies but they made us wait at the stop at 5:45 but didn't pick us up until 6:10am.  Then we went to pick up a bus full of people from other places.  At the end, even though we passed by downtown Fremont they did not let us get off first and dropped us off last again.  \nOver 10 hours trip to see the grand canyon for 2 hours and have a rude driver, don't do it.  Find a better company without the false advertisements.
2;If you pay the $7 24 hour pass and plan to go down up and down The Strip for that long then The Deuce is the way to go! It is easy to spot The Deuce because it is a gold double decker bus. Often times the bus is jammed packed and at one stop they had to turn passengers away because they were too full. Probably a common occurrence for the bus drivers to do when driving The Strip. Despite those inconveniences walking or taking The Deuce is really the best way to get around on The Strip because driving is a real pain in the ass and it doesn't help when there are loads of inconsiderate Nevada drivers on the roads as well as tourists who are driving and don't haven a clue to what they are doing! That doesn't stop from taxi drivers from beeping at you with their horns when you are in a crosswalk and in their way though!
3;Best coffee in the area! I had their red velvet latte today and nothing else even compares. Friendly employees and cozy atmosphere inside too! My only complaint is it's a little pricey. I'm also a little surprised they don't have any high chairs, but overall I'm happy to give them my business and I will definitely be back!
0;From the moment we were sat, we waited for almost 10 minutes to be greeted by our server.  The restaurant was empty by the way...we were the only poeple in there.  When we asked about the menu, we got the vaguest descriptions of the sushi rolls.  Being the only table In the restaurant, we were surprised that our order took extra long.  The server never came back and out drinks were not refilled.  Part of our order was finally delivered but our appetizer was not to be seen.  We were finally told that there was a problem in the kitchen and a few minutes later the appetizer and second roll arrived. You would think. Being the only table in the restaurant, everything would be perfect.  Not the case.  Maybe that is why they are so super slow for lunch?  We'll go back to RA next time. :(
2;I rode along with a friend to Scottsdale for the day and she treated me to lunch. We ended up going to Stingray Sushi near the Fashion Square Mall. They have a great patio to sit out on and enjoy a nice day in AZ. The sushi was good we got a Vegas roll a Philli roll and a California roll pretty standard and then a order of chicken yakitori. Between three of us it was plenty and our friend had plenty left over to take home which was good. The Vegas roll was mildly soggy from all the eel sauce when it got to us and the chicken was dry but it still tasted alright. The service was pretty good both times i have been. I would go if i was in the neighborhood and wanted sushi.
1;ugh....well, let me start over. absolutely great music. beautiful people. but you will PAY! 15 bucks a drink (luckily we got pretty wasted on a case or two of supermarket beer before going over), so we only had one each. \n\nand it's the first time i've ever given the door man money to let us in a club. my wife and her friend...no problem. 2 hot chicks...but then i was the tagalong, so they wouldn't let me in with them. \n\nfinally got in and luckily didn't have to pay cover (you get bombarded with free passes up and down the strip) but once inside.....felt like i was a big baller. \n\nso maybe i should give it more stars but the freaking door man....in defense, i guess it was halloween weekend and this is after all Fity Cents club.
4;I just bought a house and needed my doors re-locked.  Called around 9:30 and Toby was there by 1:00pm.  He was courteous, professional and knowledgeable.  Would definitely recommend him to anyone needing a great locksmith.\nThanks!
2;i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95. \n\nmy friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.\n\nthe place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly.
0;"Had dinner last night.  I ordered calamari from our waiter who called himself \""meatball,\"" and I  asked if he had tarter sauce.  He said they did not have tarter sauce. I asked if he had any mayo (I could make my own).  He said to me \""I'm not making you tarter sauce,\"" then turned his head and mouthed some obscene remark.  I was very insulted.    After dinner I paid the bill and gave him a 10% tip instead of my standard 20% and on the check I added a message that he insulted me and I'd see him on Yelp.  He ran after me where I was standing at the curb, irrationally and aggressively talking about the tarter sauce.  I tried to explain that he totally missed the point, and that it was how he handled my request, but he wouldn't listen.  He told me to get off the  (public) property or he would call the police.  My husband thought \""meatball,\"" a 350 pound guy, was going to hit me.  The whole scene was a nightmare.  This is the first time I have critiqued a restaurant on Yelp and I was astounded at the depth of the negative reviews."
1;I was extremely excited to finally eat here! in the end.. I was very disappointed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I love oysters! Being an oyster bar we thought it must be fresh and delicious! Holy crap was the oysters shitty!  We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! They did not take the liberty to rinse or scrub the oysters shells before prying them open.  I do not think they were fresh! We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.  It was already hard enough trying to eat the dirty oysters..after eating the bad one we noticed the couple others didn't look good.  The worker at the end never took our plate away until the end asking if we were going to finish it.. yeah we just said no.  There's something wrong there if we did not finish it buddy!  We watched them open the oysters after and saw how dirty the shells were and noticed that the shells had bands around them to keep the oysters from opening.  THIS PLACE IS NOT KNOWN FOR THE OYSTERS!\n\nWe also had New England Clam Chowder and Chicken Gumbo.  These came out a lot better.  I've never had Gumbo but my boyfriend said it was decently good.  I am a fan of clam chowder, and it was good, nothing amazing.  So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.\n\nThe service, it was mehhh.  I swear the cook in front of us looked miserable, took some time for us to have a server attend to us the couple times we needed something..\n\nDefinitely will not be back..
4;This place is really amazing.  Everything about it was really great: service, ambiance, food, desert, drinks.  I had the soup, which is amazing.  I then had the deer medallions and the cheesecake to finish.  Everything tasted REALLY great and the prices were reasonable.  If you are in the area this is a MUST visit restaurant.
1;Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste.
3;Oh Lush how I love thee. I was fortunate to discover Lush in 2000 while traveling in Sweden. At that time I bought as much as I could fit into my backpack and brought it back to the States! Yes I was a Lush smuggler.Every time I returned to Europe I bought all the Lush products I could. I think since 2000 I have been to a Lush store in over 12 countries! Even Iceland had a store before the US did!\nSince I was traveling a decent amount my favorite product was and still is their shampoo bars. They are great to pack since they don't take up much space and you don't have to worry about the liquid ban!\n\nOne negative thing is that Lush will discontinue items- including my favorite shampoo bar ever- Jumping Juniper =(\n\nThere is an amazing sale after Christmas where their poxed sets are buy 1 get 2 free!!!\n\nThe only reason I can't give the store 5 stars is the odor. Some people really like the smell in the store, but for me it is overpowering and I have to leave the store for a few min. while shopping in order to breathe. A larger store doesn't smell quite as strong as the FS store. I think more ventilation is in order. \n\nBut overall go forth and shop!
3;Came in with the family today, it's been awhile since our last visit.\n\nWe ordered the Stray Kitty on White with Tuna, a brownie, and the Half Red Bird\n\nI ate the tuna and just loved it, quite tantalizing. The wife enjoyed her red bird as well. And the brownie? Forget about it  - spectacular!! Didn't stand a chance. Ha\n\nOnly challenge was our cashier (young female) seemed put out by our questions about the menu.\n\nI would have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to friends.
3;They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness.
2;Located inside The Venetian is the Grand Lux Cafe. You cant miss it! It is right by the escalators leading up to parking lot where valet is done. I would describe Grand Lux Cafe as a upscale Cheesecake Factory, but a little bit more expensive. It seems that every single time that I am in Vegas, I end up here. From prior experiences, I would have rated this place a 4-5 star, but it did not meet my expectations this time around. It will definitely make me hesitate whether or not I would want to dine here the next time around. Did my eagerness and excitement for this place finally die? \n\nWe arrive and sit in a booth in the bar area because we wanted to watch the Lakers game that was on. \n\nBeing in the mood for a burger, I ordered The Max Burger which had certified angus beef topped with cheddar cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, onions and roasted short ribs, with Fries. It was good, but not good where I was jumping with joy. \n\nOur waitress Jina was on PMS the whole night. \n\nShe was rude and the gf kept noticing it. I was paying attention to the game so I dont know what exactly was going on. I can tell you what I heard from the gf though. She was working as if she hated her job and did not want to be there. She would roll her eyes whenever we wanted some more water, drinks, etc. She was throwing some of our dishes onto the table. She was telling us to move our drinks out of the way in a rude way so she could set down our dishes. She was fat. She was ugly. She was Jina.
3;Clearly the magic words here are Capastrami and Bobbie. Go in knowing those two words and I promise you you'll leave one happy sandwich-eating mofo. \n\nFor me the Bobbie beats the Capastrami hands down. (The damn amazingness that is the pastrami from Brix in Sunset Beach has ruined all other pastrami for me.)  \n\nThe taste of Thanksgiving all smushed together on the tastiest, softest bread ever though, truly makes the Bobbie something to write home about... or at least will make you want to find your nearest Capriottis location and get there ASAP!
1;Stopped for breakfast while waiting for my connection in PHX. Food quality was really poor. Wilted fruit, soggy home fried and an undercooked egg. Would not recommend to a friend.
3;I had read a review in the City Paper that gave Southside BBQ company a great review so I've been wanting to try it. Today we were having a late lunch so we decided to check it out. \nThere were four of us and we all ordered something different. It was like a big sampler. My husband ordered the Chicken Nachos and the Chili. A lot of times nachos are so huge that it big enough for 3 people. The nachos here are just the right size. Tithe chips were topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, smoked chicken and jalape\u00f1os. They were tasty. The smoky chicken made them amazing. The chili came in a small crock. It was bubbling and hot. It was full of flavor. It had beans and bites of smoked brisket. \nMy oldest son ordered the Redneck Club sandwich. It came on a brioche bun that had brisket and pork with a bit of coleslaw. He inhaled it. That's very telling if how good it was. \nMy youngest son ordered a burger. He's a purist so it was just meat and a bun. You know it's a good burger when it tastes good without any toppings. The burger tasted like it was hot off a charcoal grill. It even had grill marks. \nI ordered 6 wings. I was going to share them but after tasting them I no longer wanted to share. The wings are not winglets and they aren't fried. They are whole wings and they are grilled. They are the best wings I've ever had. I was kind enough to share . . . This time. \nFor dessert we ordered peach cobbler. It was a little different from normal cobblers. It was more like a thick piece off a dense cake. It had a lot of peaches on it along with vanilla ice cream. It was warm and satisfying. It was big enough for 3 of us to share. \nWe'll definitely be back. I recommend you stop in and try it out.  Make sure to order wings.
3;I love this place! Caked really saved my butt, they took my Birthday cake order for a Sunday (a day on which they are closed, which I didn't know!) My cake was ready on Saturday and I was able to bring it to the Restaurant for my birthday dinner the next day.\n\nI ordered a Lemon poppy seed cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream for the filling the cake was fresh, tasty and beautiful ( (I will include a photo!) Caked was recommended to me by Retro bakery as they were booked for the day but I will always recommend Caked!  They also gave us some coffee cookies to taste which were delicious!!
3;Good place for the price! Make sure you get on their email list for good deals. \n\nIve stayed at alot of the different hotels on the strip and I got to say this place has been added to my list. I was kind of worried since I read different mixed reviews on this place, but they proved all the negativity wrong. \n\nOne thing though...\n\nDO NOT UPGRADE TO BROADWAY!!!\n\nWe got a Broadway room the first night  because the guy at the front desk had UPGRADED us....totally disappointed with the room. the decor was bland and the room looked very old. don't be fooled just because it says its bigger.  I was facing the back part of the hotel which is the parking lot.\n\nI called the following morning to change rooms....Very easy process. \nI DOWNGRADED to a PARK AVENUE room. Now this room was nice. very clean. Nicely decorated and a better view of the strip. I was on the 24th floor. \n\nBeds are comfortable and so are the pillows. The bathroom is like a normal bathroom nothing special...but I honestly don't care...I just need it to do my business and take a shower..\n\nSound proof walls... I didn't hear any noise when we were in our room. \n\nThe staff was very friendly. \n\nThe location is good. if you don't feel like walking then you can catch the monorail at MGM which is right across the way. \n\nThe roller coaster was cool said the hubby. Check out the schedule you have in your room because there is a 2 for 1 special during a certain time of the day. \n\nA suggestion though is to bring a cooler of some sort and buy some drinks and water to keep in the room..so you don't have to keep on going downstairs to get  something to drink.\n\nThe reason I give it a four star is for the LONGGGGGGGG WALK to my room. I mean seriously...I had to pack water and food just for the walk to the room.lol. \n\nAll in all....its a nice hotel for the price...remember your not in vegas to be in your room.....unless your on your honeymoon...in that case stay at the Bellagio, Venetian, or the Wynn...\n\nI definitely will be staying here again in the future....
2;Went here on a sat night around 9. Place was not crowded, cool vibe though, nice and dark with comfortable booths and a wall of plasma tv's. \n\nBeer list was pretty short and disappointing but ordered a Four Peaks Kilt lifter.  \nBurger list was pretty interesting but I ended up ordering the peppercorn burger and my wife ordered the sweet and spicy burger and split an order of half and half fries. The burgers were massive but the peppercorn burger was pretty plain, nothing to write home about, and not that tasty considering the price ($10). My wife's burger was great and way better than my burger. It has some sort of tempura on the burger with loads of sweet chili and was delicious. I guess the extra $2 bucks I spent on this burger made all the difference.\n\nAll in all the place is great to chill out have a beer, watch some tv, and grab a decent burger. Place though was over priced. 2 burgers, 1 beer, and 1 order of fries will set you back 40 bucks with tip. For 40 bucks I would rather go grab a steak and a beer. Not sure how long this place will last at this price especially for burgers.
3;Best eggs Benedict ever, although non - traditional. Great quiche but a puny slice. Great fritata, too. Leisurely service.
1;"I stopped in for a quick lunch time snack of guacamole and chips today. The first bit of bad news is their driveway; huge pot holes right where the entrance meets the sidewalk at University Avenue. I mean, break an axle huge.\n\nThe restaurant interior is oddly laid out, with huge communal tables and very few places for individuals or smaller parties to sit. The music is loud, and everything has that vaguely sticky patina of a beachside popsicle stand, including the riotous color scheme.\n\nThey did prepare my order quickly, and the service was friendly. Too bad the food was utterly disappointing. The tortilla chips had the distinctly off flavor of rancid cooking oil, and the guacamole was thick and gluey in texture and unremarkable in flavor. I got up and left after a few bites."
0;I wouldn't stay here again, ever. I was in town for a technology conference and the Internet didn't work in the conference area or in the rooms. It was very spotty wireless and wired. The room decor  was very dated. But here's the worst: First morning my sinks back up while shaving. One sink backed up with my water and the other backed up simultaneously with a black smelly liquid. I also complained about the lack of seal at the bottom of the connecting door between my suite and the one next door. I could hear everything in that room like it was happening in mine. (Imagine that) I insisted on being moved to a new room. In the new room on my last morning... I hear a gurgling noise and then smell something foul. I walk into the bathroom to see black liquid coming up through the shower drain. I reported it on check out and they didn't seem to care. Any other hotel would have tried to make it right. Not these guy... Harrahs should be ashamed of this property.
4;"Pizza by Napoli will always have a place in my heart. I have been frequenting this place for over 7 years now and NOT ONCE has it compromised in taste, style or service. I know when I go there years from now, I will get to enjoy every reason that makes this place special for me. Taste-wise, I can speak for the pizza, wings and beer as this is all I ever want when I go...BECAUSE THERE SO DAMN GOOD!!! The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use! The wings have a nice crunchiness but are still traditionally bathed in an awesome wing sauce and worth every bit of mess you make of yourself. The beer is served right and makes the food that much better. When I say served right; I'm speaking of the thick, LARGE, glass pitcher that you could use to battle any incoming zombies or just use it to fill up the ice dripping mugs! Keep in mind, this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings. Best of all is it is very affordable as I have never thought I paid too much and if your looking for a cheap lunch special, they have it! As for atmosphere, it is very down to earth, no frills, just some beer signs and simple pictures of Napoli or some far off Italian hillside. The exact same group of guys has been there every time I have went and I actually don't know if they ever leave. Every time you see them they are cleaning or breaking down some machine to clean because it took a beating during lunch time. These guys have an awesome \""tough as nails\"" Italian attitude and can come off pushy when placing your order for lunch but for god sake it's lunch time; it's busy, live with it! For dinner, you order it up front and then they bring it to you instead of picking it up from the front and don't worry, at this time the guys are all very gracious. Overall, this place is a classic and if your looking for great pizza in Phoenix; this is your place, if you just feel like something a little better for a pizza to take home; this is your place; if you want a genuine, down to earth experience; this is your place!"
4;"AMAZING!!! I went here the other night and had the best burger ever!! Literally I doubt anyone can top this!! The prices are decent too! This little \""hole-in-the-wall\"" doesn't do little for their food :) The burgers were huge and yummy! The Grind reminded me of somewhere you would find in NYC.. The lighting and even the awesome TV's made the restaurant seem very modern with a stylish touch! I will definitely be going here again!!!!!"
2;"First time going to this spot since I moved to vegas was last night. And this place is huge! Yes theres alot of meat heads and girls decked out in makeup, but thats expected from newer \""hotter\"" gym locations. Luckily I went when it was late at night so the spot was fairly empty. I wouldnt recommend going here during peak gym hours."
0;"I recently attended Studio Movie Grill for the first time... I will not be returning to this theater again and I am surprised they are still in business. I bought a groupon over a year ago and forgot that I had purchased them. I read on the groupon that the amount I spent on the tickets would still be validated through Studio Movie Grill, however, the actual groupon purchased for 2 tickets and 2 drinks for 10.00 would not be validated. My understanding was that I would have 10.00 to spend at the theater. When I logged onto my groupon for the day to print the tickets I noticed they had the same promotion going on for the 2 tickets and 2 small drinks. I figured I would call the theater to see if they may honor what I purchased through groupon since they were currently offering the same \""newer\"" promotion. I called the theater several times and they do NOT have anyone answering phones. I tried all of the automated numbers and not a single human answered the phone. They offer to call you back but I took my break at work to call and cannot receive calls at work seeing as I work in a hospital with patients and I am constantly on my feet. So my coworker and I decided to see the Purge on Tuesday night at 520pm. We grabbed a nice happy hour at the Four Peaks nearby and went over to the theater at 5:10pm. Upon arrival to the front \""purchase\"" desk, I asked the girl if they would consider honoring my expired groupon since they were doing the same promotion presently. She looked confused mummbled something, said I dont know and than began to charge us the full price for the movies. I decided that 4.00 was not a huge issue and she clearly did not know how to ask someone for the answer considering she had no anwer herself. As my friend and I went to find the theater for our movie we noticed that she charged us for Iron man 3 which had started 15 minutes prior to our purchase, and it was the wrong movie. So not only was she incompetent in finding out an answer, she was not competent in our purhcase of the correct movie. We returned to the front desk with the manager seeking the correct movie. I noticed there were two young blonde employees at this point. The newest employee was being asked the question of what are matinee times by a young couple arriving to the movie theater. Her response consisted of looking at the manager several times... the manager helping my friend and I, and then stating...\""they are in the afternoon.\"" I could not believe that an employee was not knowledgeable on what times a mantinee consisted of. So my friend and I went to sit down in the theater now having the purchase of the correct movie. The seats were moderately comfortable and I felt as though I was in a conference center preparing for a powerpoint presentation. The staff was loud during the entire movie taking orders from the other patrons which was distracting. The menu we received to order from stated that Tuesdays were ladies nights and ladies could receive 5.00 movies all day and night long. We had paid 7.00 per ticket and not offered the ladies night price. At the end of the movie my friend and I exited the theater at which point I noticed a different manager from who had helped us previously. I went up to him and asked him why we were not honored the ladies night price and he said that we could not be honored that with a groupon. I said that my groupon had expired and it stated that it was a 10.00 gift certificate to the theater...so why not just offer the guests the 5.00 price? He said no and I said well thank you, over four dollars I will not be returning to your theater and I plan on writing a review. His response consisted of an \""ok.\"" As many times as I've seen groupon offering deals to this theater it is CLEAR they need more patrons and are not making enough money. Maybe they need to consider a change in employees, consider training employees on competencies and managers on satisfying patrons over FOUR DOLLARS. Had my friend and I received the slightest amount of good customer service and compassion we would probably return to the theater but due to the lack of customer service and employee knowledge you couldn't pay me to return to this theater. I would highly recomment amc cinema suites for they have a more knowledgeable and helpful staff and way more comfortable seating. I do not see Studio Movie Grill maintaining their business much longer and that projection is also based on how often they have to offer groupon prices to just get patrons to come see a movie."
4;Two friends and I visited Blue Sky today for the first time.  We all had mani/pedis and it was sheer heaven for all three of us!!  The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!
1;The dinner was forgettable and the show was odd. The restaurant was so loud I could barely hold a conversation. \n\nI had certain expectations for this place and it is Vegas, but the show look like it was some cheap rendition of a strip club and circus. The comedy was slapstick, the seats moved for some reason, and a super skinny lady stripped with hankerchiefs. There was also a lame bit with a pomeranian and a cannon. Yes, a real dog was placed in a cannon and an obviously stuffed dog was shot out. Take your money and go to a real Vegas show.
4;"Long overdue review. Last time I ate here was almost 6 months ago. I really love the I-Naba chain. Back when I was still living in Los Angeles County, they had a I-NABA in the South Bay area. The one thing I remember about the place was how good they treated my Dad on account of him being such a popular figure in the Los Angeles Japanese-American community. I always thought it was funny how they always kissed his ass and treated him like royalty. At this Las Vegas location, they never heard of him. \n\nWhen people say that I-Naba is the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, I can easily understand why people would say that. This place has introduced a dish which is extremely popular in Japan to the morbidly uncultured people of Las Vegas. Even though I personally believe that Shogu and Hiro's famous \""Sushi-on-Rainbow\"" restaurant is the best and even the most culturally significant Japanese restaurant in LV, I can see why some people may say I-NABA is the bees nees. In fact, I agree that I-NABA is much greater than Ichiza or any of the poke-MON restaurants.  \n\nI love buckwheat soba. I really love buckwheat soba. I have eaten Zaru Soba every single night for the last 6 months. It's a great source of complex carbohydrates, and it helps keep my weight down. If you are a narcissistic pretty boy like me, I really recommend replacing your carb source with buckwheat soba. It gives you that energy you need to workout hard, with the fiber and health benefits as an added bonus.  \nEvery Zaru Soba fan would much prefer to go to one of these soba places that actually have their noodles specifically made for their restaurant. You can get Zaru Soba at Shuseki and Ichiza but they use the same noodles that you get at places like Nakata Market of Japan or Japan Creek Market. Don't get me wrong, I ain't knocking Shuseki. In fact, Shuseki is my favorite noodle house in Vegas, but when you taste the freshly made noodles at I-NABA, you will immediately recognize the difference in taste. \n\nThe girl who works here is really fun to talk with. Last time I was here we had a conversation about Japanese identity. She is half-Japanese/White, and I'm half-Japanese/Korean. So, it was one of the more interesting conversations I have had this year. \n\nI-NABA also holds the unique title of having my very favorite Vegetable Tempura.  The vegetables they use taste organically grown, and they slice them so nice in that symmetrically perfect style. I really like places that make their own Tempura dipping sauce in house. I can only think of 2 other places in LV that do this(SushiTwister and Sushi on Rainbow). \n\nI really wish I could eat here everyday or at least more often. Problem is that I work 60 hours 7 days a week. By the time I get off work this place is usually closed. I heard that they might start opening later when they get their liquor license. I hope it's soon."
3;I heard so much about this place, and I've been wanted to try... \n\nFood: it is tapas style, or in Japanese izakaya style.  Each portion is small so it will be good if you order about two dishes per person to share with the group.  Everything we ordered was very good, great flavor, nicely presented. Looked yummy and tasted yummy too.\n\nDates wrapped in bacon: I like the sauce on the dish. Dates and bacon are interesting mix but this sauce nicely mixed together.\n\nSuzuki roll: I liked the smell and taste of slightly deep fried? rice around the roll.\nMaya roll: Double spicy (spicy tuna and spicy sauce (I think it was wasabi base sauce).  Nonetheless, liked the flavor.\nKimuchi fried rice: tasted better than the one I make at home. Smelled the kimuchi but it wasn't overwhelming at all.   Sometimes kimuchi could be strong, but I think the sauce on the dish toned it down to the level the kimuchi was enjoyable.\nChinese Chicken salad: nothing fancy...\nWe shared three deserts and all were good. \n\nThis place said Mexican Asian fusion but the way they used difference sauce reminded me of French food.  I think they used French dressing for Chinese Chicken salad\nNice decor inside, mix of Mexican and Asian. I didn't necessarily loved it but it was certainly interesting for sure.\n\nService: although it was good but very slow... We were there for lunch and ended up being there for two hours. So if you are in a rush, this place is not good for you. Go there only if you want to enjoy the fun atmosphere with a group of friends to enjoy conversation.\n\nFood was so interesting, I want to come back and try all the rest when I have more time. I like French, Mexican and Asian in general. When combined, it is perfect of all.
1;"Jackalopes what happened?!!! This used to be my favorite place. They did some renovations and it's a very nice venue. But they've hired some new staff and the waitresses are TERRIBLE. I always sit in the karaoke/TV section. The last few times I've been there service has been horrible. After you get your food and drinks they disappear. And this is at like 8pm on a Saturday when the place is nowhere near packed. \n\nThe last 2 times I came my friends and I ended up just leaving my money on the table without a check. One time my friend hunted the waitress down TWICE and asked for our checks. She was sitting outside talking to some guys and kept saying \""I'll be there in a minute.\"" I went this past Saturday and the same thing happened. A group of 2 other women just left because they were tired of waiting. We also had a huge group sitting next to us that was getting restless. And it's not like you can just grab another waitress or someone. They all go AWOL. \n\nI'm used to bringing 4+ people here for dinner, buying $100+ in drinks (just for me - don't judge, lol) and tipping very well. The new staff is very lazy and missing out on a lot of money. Not just for themselves but for the entire bar. I love this venue and so do a lot of others PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER!!!\n\nP.S. I miss Rachel. Not sure why they changed karaoke vendors. But the new karaoke guy is very personable and talented."
2;I remember when this place was on the corner of 19th Ave and Tbird.  Ive been coming here that long.  Seems like the last few times I have been in here it appears that the prices have gone up or is it just me?  Otherwise I enjoy coming here as the employees are always willing to help me find what I am looking for or check another location for me.
2;High end for high maintenance. If you're looking to make a serious crack in your credit card I'd suggest taking it here. The decor is very nice, the people not so much. If you don't look like you belong, i.e. having white straw bleached fake blond hair and a faux tan then you'll probably get snubbed by at least one of the other shoppers or a store clerk. Not really my style, but 3 stars for the nice building and fixtures.
1;Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town.
1;Was REALLY hoping that this place would be amazing...\n\nIt wasn't\n\n\nTotally over-rated\n\nCarne Asada is very bland\n\n$1 tacos from taco trucks in LA BLOW this place away\n\nClose by...such a shame
1;I thought that this store was going to be better than the stores I have been to in California.
1;"Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.\n\nThe staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""all you have to do is ask\""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""well I know you'll be back\"".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle."
1;Don't go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever.  Every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines.
4;My mother needed to get her tile cleaned.  So  I came across this company and thier reasonable prices.   They came out just to do the tile originally and did such a good job.  My mother had her place rugs done too.   The turned out way above my expectations.   The company's professionalism and quality of work will definatley make him recomend him to all my family and friends.
0;First, all lunches are $13.00 each plus $2.15 for drinks. Too expensive for lunch.  The green beans/potatos and rice wer very good.  Generous  quantities. \n\nthe chicken was miserabe. over cooked, dry, the crust was almost without flavor,.  There no redeaming factors. If this is true soul food, I am not doing soul again.
1;An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.
0;"I have eaten at several different locations and this one is a trainwreck. The food is terrible. I have no idea how chain food can taste THAT different from the other restaurants, but it's not even close. The fries were literally burned to a crisp. I called to complain and whoever answered the phone said \""So?\"". There's a McDonald's right up the street where the employees are super friendly (and the food is edible). I just go there instead."
2;UNLV is a virtual Mecca for cheap prices, good quality, and diversity in cuisine. Every time someone brought up burger joints, Smash was a destination worth mentioning. It was never the first on the list, but as I continue to cross out places I have tried, it was time to give them a taste.\n\nWhen I entered, the cashier greeted me and asked if I had been there before. Usually when you reply no, the other person would explain, but he just asked for my order. That was not a big deal because I am usually set before I step anywhere near the register. The customer service was good overall, because when I did not order a drink, the cashier offered me a cup for water.\n\nI had a job interview today, so I opted for the avocado club smash chicken sandwich because it did not have anything that would leave a lingering smell. If it was any other day, I probably would have gone for a burger with the works. The chicken breast was cut in two to cook faster, I liked this style because it allowed the meat to stay moist and juicy. Often the breast dries out and become overcooked if left whole. On top of that, they add four crisp strips of bacon, four slices of avocado, ranch, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich is delicious, but pricey for the university area. At $7.99, you can go to In-N-Out and get a double double combo meal with a shake. At Smash, for the price of everything you would get next door, it would run you close to fifteen dollars. The food is good, but for that price I would probably go to Bachi Burger or Holsteins. I could pay a little more for a more unique meal.
3;"Yum. Yum. Seafood. and Steak. Yummy in my Tummy.\n\nI've been wanting to go to Joe's ever since I saw it featured on Giada's Weekend Getaways (although that was the Miami location).\n\nI wanted to come here for dinner, and we had some trouble finding reservations on a Friday night (then again, probably shouldn't have tried to make reservations that day). We ended up taking a 5:30 spot, which is, not surprisingly, when they open up for the dinner service.\n\nWe ordered the Stone Crab appetizer, the crab cakes, and the rib eye steak. While waiting for our meal, we were served a basket of different types of bread. Hands down, the little pretzel bread was my absolute favorite. \n\nWe were served the our appetizer, and we dived into the four claws that we were served.  They were soo good, succulent, and with a sweeter flavor than you find in the dungeness crabs I normally eat in LA.  The mustard dipping sauce was really good too; definitely not too mustardy. I would actually call it more of an aioli.  \n\nOur entress were delectable as well. I ordered the crab cakes, and my eyes popped open when they were served I was expecting a couple disk-shaped cakes, but these were no mere disks, but MOUNDS.  The cakes had practically no fillers to it, but was just all sweet, delicious crab.  The steak was amazing as well.  It had a delicious, almost salty crust to it, and it was perfectly cooked. It brought to mind that I haven't had a good steak in, well, a long time.  We ate every bit of food on our places (despite being extremely full), and walked out of the restaurant with that feeling where you're happy from the awesome meal you just ate, mixed with the uncomfortable, slightly lethargic feeling you get from just eating way too much."
2;I get what Duo do (provide shoes of varying widths to fit all sizes of calves and feet) and I find it admirable to a point, but I don't think this store is particularly good. I've never really had a problem getting boots or shoes to fit elsewhere, so I'm probably not their ideal customer, but I can't help feeling that they could do what they do in a much better way. The styles are all very pedestrian and the large store always seems to be pretty empty - of stock and customers. I've been in to browse on a couple of occasions and the assistants have never once approached to help me (probably because it would take them ten minutes to walk the length of the shop). This place would be much better if they filled it up with a few more pairs of shoes and some more attentive staff.
3;I've been to Vanguard quite a few times. It is definitely a great spot if your looking for a speciality cocktail or want to try something different. The bar area is nice and clean, and I've never had a problem getting a drink or sitting at the bar on a busy night. \n\nI tend to drink a lot of different drinks, and will spend time pondering what i am going to have indulge in at other places. Not here though. The Jack Rose. Every time I go, that is immediately what I order. Apple Brandy. Maple Syrup. Black Cherry. Damn I want one just thinking about it. Who doesn't love maple syrup. Believe me, all the drinks are good and after 2 or 3, you'll may need to take a break. \n\nAll in all, great place. A little loud at night on the weekends with the DJ, and the crackheads from Fremont who come in too look around or do the crackhead shuffle for a minute or two until they leave.
1;Tried this place a couple of times too many. It's just not that great. Pizza, salads, garlic knots... none of it stands out. Wouldn't try it again even for free. Much better places out there.
4;Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.
2;Meh.\n\nThe +'s:\n+ Great outdoor sidewalk cafe with plenty of shade to kill that relentless heat\n+ Great people watching for those crossing Caesar's Palace\n+ Great for large groups but place can get crowded at peak times. Consider reservations.\n+ Plenty of brunch choices which is meal I sat for: chicken and waffles, steak strip sandwich, omelettes, french toast, pancakes bigger than your head and etc.\n+ French toast decent. Decadent and huge portions. \n+ Portions are great to be shared. Think massive caloric portions like Cheesecake Factory. Gross! Best to be shared than downed alone.\n+ Great home fries.\n\nThe -'s:\n- Portions are gargantuan! Hello server who served 12 girls. Did you not see we were all petite?? It would have been a better tip for you if you had just suggested that the portions were huge. None of us finished our meals and we can all eat but come on! The food portions were ridiculous and we could have shared. And no we did not know the portions were huge because more none of the patrons are from Vegas!!!!\n- We were asked to wait nearly 45 minutes until another server could arrive because our party was too large to serve! And this was after we had called for reservations in advance and were told that we would have no problem being seated at 10am. Get your story straight.\n- 10 oz. sirloin steak sandwich for $20. I saw mostly French baguette rather than steak. \n- Frozen hot chocolate. It's just hot chocolate that has sat in the freezer. Or hot chocolate over ice. Not memorable. Pass.
1;Hi Ashley, \n   Thank you for your response. During the day our experience has been fine. I think your night crew is not as polished. As I said, Gimme Sugar has excellent macaroons! We may be back. We will go during the day though when your service is better :-).\n\nThank you, \nAustin Gold
4;If you love soda than this is the place. I love the dif root beers they have there it's an amazing selection! one of the best stores in las vegas hand's down. I could go there veryday nad try something new and I would never ge tired of it at all
1;Went there on a Saturday night for beers after a day moving with friends. The beer selection is great, and they have a happy hour from 3 to 6. The waitress did not let us know of the special and by the time we realized the special, she reappeared 5 minutes too late. She was, however, nice.\n\nThe place feels overall unclean. The good reviews on the walls from past times only added to my impression that the pub is falling apart. \n\nAmbiance was dive-bar like, and they have spotlights instead of regular lights if you like to constantly feel like you're a stage performer.\n\nTo top it off, no hard liquor allowed in the gaming areas.\n\nI just feel like the owner stopped trying. A shame as it has great potential.
2;Same old M&M World with colorful hard shell candies everywhere. The only thing that I've found new is the 3D ride they have on the 3rd floor, is that new? I don't remember it being there before. It's a good 5-10 minutes long.\n\nGreat for kids, and the sweet tooths...
0;Wow.....as bad as it gets.... And I've been traveling for 39 years. Terrible terrible terrible
0;So we did a little jumping around tonight.. Our adventures brought us to the $5 bar menu at BLT Steak.. Specifically the Kobe Beef hot dog.  I had it, I ate it, and I thought it was okay.. Eh..  \n\n$12 drinks wasn't really appealing either.  My New Fashioned was good but for that price, it better be tall.. It was not.  Please avoid this place.  Unless you got some serious dough to throw around on semi good food.  \n\n-Ian M.
3;There are a couple of things that make you realize you are at a LEGIT mexican place.\n\nMenu has lots of things that you have no idea what it means\nThere is a random guy that plays a guitar in the corner\nAnd the most important : there is a chubby nice mexican lady making tortillas ..fresh ones \n\nThis restaurant was amazing. Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!\n\nI am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop?? \n\nWhat would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!\n\nWe were a group of 12 and the food came outstanding, service was impressive, ambiance was legit and overall experience was great. Check it out !!
1;This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.
4;FIrst of the event coordinator Annie is AMAZING.  She is spunky, beautiful, and so nice.  She made me feel so welcome!  The patio at Tommy's is breath taking.  You feel like you are on an island.  The atmosphere is so calm and breezy.  \n\nThe staff welcomed me as if I was a regular.  I had this amazing steak salad called Saba Steak Salad.  And I had the Island Goat Cheese.  I can barely explain them because I will talk myself into going back there.\n\nThe steak in the salad melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection!  The dressing had a garlic aioli that added so much flare and flavor.  There were 3 potato coins on the side that were a great addition to the salad.   The spring mix and romaine was fresh and I was very pleased.\n\nNow to the goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  So tasty!!  It wasn't overwhelming is was perfect.  There were tortillas strips on the side that were dangerous because I really wanted a bag of them when I was done.  There was also a mango salsa with the cheese and I will admit I had a spoonful of it on its own.\n\nAs you can tell I HIGHLY recommend Tommy Bahamas.  What would be great is everyone bought tickets to the Original Taste this weekend and you can taste 36 restaurants in one event!!!
2;Didn't stay at the hotel but the Craps game is the best even though it only pays double on 12, it offers 100X odds!!! Well worth it for cheap gaming on the Strip. The place is a little old but not run down, with low ceilings and the air smelling like smoke. The locals are friendly and the drinks are okay.
1;I never like to write a bad review....but if I experience bad service for the money that I have spent with you, then you're gonna get it.\n\nOnly 4-6 people were actually inside dining- I stood at the bar for nearly 5 minutes to pick up food before receiving the first 'hello.'\n\nFood wasn't that bad, actually even better the next day as left-overs\n\nBut for the $$$ spent, I'll stick with my other favorites...will give it another shot someday when its nice outside and I can take advantage of their outdoor seating.
3;"I really enjoy going to Murphy's Law from time to time because this place is such a mixed bag. It's never the same bar or experience twice.\n\nYes...It's an Irish bar...But, it's an Irish bar done with a Vegas twist.\nIt's dark, and has that pub feel, but there's also a wall of tv's and more tv's everwhere you look and in the back corner of the bar there is this make shift VIP lounge with a wrap around leather couch. \nIt is a gaming bar so the machines are lined up around the bar, but there is also a separate dining section for those who have kids or those under 21 who just want to grab some food. \nThey also have a sports betting kiosk on sight, which makes it a great place to go watch a game and place your bet without getting in the lines at the casinos.\nThe service here has always been above and beyond what I'm used to in Vegas, the bartenders are really outgoing here and don't seem as pissed off to be at work as the usual places. Although, they always seem to be understaffed here no matter how many people are there, so on occasion you might have a bit of a wait time on a refill.\n\nAt the bar they have all of your Irish favorites on tap, and the happy hour special for drinks is great. Buy one get one on all drafts...not just the cheap crap. They have also been running a check in special recently where if you check in while you are there you get a shot of Jameson for $1.\nOK...so 2 Harp's for $5......Check\n1 shot of Jameson for $1.....Check\nNow I was in need of some food. They have a great happy hour menu and reverse happy hour menu late night.\n\nAs you look over the menu I have to recommend one thing: \nTHE ROUND REUBEN...What's that you ask...Well, you take the ingredient's of a reuben sandwich then you roll it into 4 or 5 balls, then batter it in the same batter you would do fish and chips, and then you deep fry those little guys and serve them with a side of Thousand Island, (and I always add a side of Buffalo sauce on the side as well as the vinegar helps cut the oily, fatty, fried taste.)\nIf you are thinking to yourself \""wow that sounds like a heart attack.\"" You're right...but there are few things on this earth that go better with beer.\nI've also had their wings, and the fish and chips. I'd give the fish and chips probably 3 stars, but the wings are some of the best i've had anywhere in town.\n\nThey have a trivia night, a karaoke night (which tends to play more towards the alt rock, metal crowd) and a dozen other random nights, and events.\nSo...unless you are on ANY type of diet...give this place a try, but like I said it's a different bar every time, so who know's what you will walk into"
2;I've been to see a lot of urologists.\nA lot.\n\nI'm not a fan of male doctors, but it seems that most of the urologists or kidney specialists in this town are men.\n\nI attempted several times to set up an appointment or consultation using the web form on the website, and never received anything...not a call or an email.\n\nI called on Thursday, after noon, and was able to schedule an appointment for Monday. \n\nWhen I arrived, the staff was polite, and quiet.  \nThe paperwork was a bit much...I was literally filling in paperwork for a half an hour, but I understand that new doctors need to get information.\n\nThe nurse was nice, and made me feel comfortable while I was getting my bladder ultrasound done.\n\nDr. Kaplan was nice.  He seemed a little abrasive at first, but later it seemed he was more...appalled at the fact that previous doctors hadn't done much to help me.\n\nHe's the first urologist to offer me a preventative antibiotic, since I get frequent UTIs.  I'm not 100% sold on taking an antibiotic every day, just because of super bugs, etc, but at least he offered.  No other doctor has done that.\n\nHe's also the first to offer me a medication to help with the other bladder issues I've been having, that are starting to cause problems with my job.  \n\nHis office staff filled in paperwork for me, for help with work.  The woman I worked with was absolutely wonderful.  \n\nI like the office.  I'm not in love with them yet, but I'm always VERY cautious about feeling out doctors and their staff.  I have a follow up appointment next month, so we'll see how they do then, too.
1;= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nStopped in here for lunch today with Norm R.  The descriptions of the place in Scott & Iain's reviews mostly matched what I saw, so I won't cover the same ground again.  This veggie selection is a little larger than you usually see at a (no extra charge) Mongolian BBQ within a Chinese buffet restaurant, but you pay a lot here & yet miss out on the 50 to 100 other items you would have had available at the Chinese place.  Also, the Chicken Vegetable Soup was only lukewarm.\n\nLunch:  $7.39 (no seconds allowed), or $8.39 (seconds ok).  All in all it was ok, once.
0;I bought a Groupon as well as I was upgraded on my first visit to a underarm hair removal in addition to the upper lip.  In total I paid $330 and there were no results after eight-10 visits.  When we complained that we had no success at all, they wanted us to pay more money for four additional sessions.  I think they purposely use low voltage so you keep paying and paying.  I may as well burnt my money in a fire. It seems it may be ok for botox but not hair removal. How sad when that is there name,
3;Not bad.  The format's pretty similar to Chipotle where you go up and order and pay at the register at the end.  The prices are a bit higher, but the food tastes better.  The chicken salad was huge.  The tortillas are freshly made.  The place is clean and spacious.  The employees are friendly too.
0;Very disappointed.  We drove all the way there today. There was a sign said closed ?? Nothing said on their website!!! They had about 15 people and they closed at 4:30 to take only 15 people in. I don't understand why they wouldn't let more people walk thru. Big let down today. Prolly won't go back for several months Cuz I'm really busy :\\ but I'm calling first this time to see if they are going to close again!!!! Lol
4;This restaurant is fantastic!!! The food is always great and our go-to place for Chinese!! We order so much that the delivery guy already knows, how to get to my house and my dog by name! We have zero complaints about this place. They deliver all the way to my house on Sig Butte/Southern. Just great service all the time. Owner did deliver once when they confused the plates, but no worries, they fixed it instantly. A must try in East Mesa!!!\n\nBTW: I just called right now to place an order and the guy recognized my voice/address and knew what we wanted!!
0;I'm surprised to see so many 5 star reviews, I had a very bad experience here!\n\nI went here the other day based off of the reviews on yelp... What a big mistake!!!\n\nI simply went to get my eyebrows done the lady was very friendly and asked if I had my eyebrows threaded before which I have. So she's doing my brows and she asks if I'm ok because I guess I looked like I was in a lot of pain.. Which I was in alot of pain I've never had it hurt that bad when getting my brows threaded it felt like my skin was being pulled off. So anyways she finishes and hands me the mirror they looked ok she had missed a few spots and my skin was red and irritated but I figured it would heal. \n\nSo the next day I wake up and looked in the mirror and I see my skin was ripped in several spots I had bumps and blood stains from her pulling at my skin, on top of that I noticed she had missed more then just a few spots of hair there was tons of hairs left! \n\nI will not be returning here it was a waste of money and I had to get my eyebrows done 5 days after she had did them. Not to mention she damaged my skin!
2;Join CF because it's the only full service gym in the downtown Madison area. I was attracted to the fact that they include a lot of free classes & all the yoga you could want, it is big enough to have your own space and it has a Kidszone.\n\nPros:  \n\n1. As far as I can tell, I have always been able to get on equipment that I want. I normally don't go at peak hours so I can't tell you if this is true all the time\n\n2. Locker room seems clean, has two saunas and a steam room if you are into that. Plenty of lockers between the two in the building.\n\n3. Doesn't have a smelly gym smell to the workout area or locker room. \n\n4. Easy to get into classes if you plan just slightly ahead. Some classes are more popular than others. Over all very good yoga instructors. \n\nCons:\n\n1. Kidszone is a complete joke!\n\nThey either need to embrace the concept or give it up. Right now, it's a poor excuse for a place to take your kids while you work out. It would seem like the person who is responsible for managing the Kidszone isn't a parent or forgets what it was like to have little kids....\n\nThe kids play area is lacking any real activities. I have a 5 & 3 yr old and they absolutely hate going there. They say it is boring and I can't blame them. There are a few mats to play on and not much more. There needs to be something more to play with... ie: TOYS! You know, those things kids love to play with... They don't have to be fancy... a few books, some blocks, a few cars and trucks, maybe a small dramatic play area.....  It doesn't take much to keep a kid busy for an hour but they really need more than a few gym mats.\n\nAlso, they won't change diapers or help older children use the restroom... What?? If you are going to have a kidzone, it comes with the territory.... Diapers, maybe but little kids & bathroom, you need to help them if they're toilet trained. The restrooms are not equipped for little kids so it would be hard for a little kid to get up on the toilet. Also, anyone who has little kids know that they may have to go 20 mins after they just went...  If you won't change diapers, you need to have a bathroom equipped to change diapers... diaper changing table would help! \n\nNon-engaging kidszone employees. Being so close to Univ of WI, you would think Capitol Fitness would have access to a ton of early childcare majors or even early education students who would like to have a chance and work at a place to gain some real work experience.   At least from the the few times I was there, there was no real engagement happening between the employee and the kids.   It's like my neighbor's kids are watching my kids. \n\nOn the flip side, if Capitol Fitness is just doing the kidszone so they can say they have one but don't really want to have kids actually in the gym, then they are very successful.  \n\n2. Parking is definitely a hassle during the week if you want to be close. If you don't want to pay for parking, go after 6:00 pm when the meters stop or park a few blocks away in the neighborhood.\n\n3. The interior of the gym is definitely looking somewhat dated. It's dark and dim. The atmosphere is sort of muted and not very motivating. The gym is starting to show it's age.\n\n4. Not a lot of sanitize wipes  / hand sanitizer around which is why I see people skipping off the equipment without cleaning it.   I've been in gyms where they are all over the place so it unavoidable not to clean the equipment after you are done.\n\n5. Towels. I know people already talked about this. I will say that they do have a ton of hand towels and a limited number of small gym towels available to use without charge.  If you need to take a shower but forget to bring your own, you could make due with two smaller gym towel. \n\nOverall, the gym is about average and you get what you pay for ($44 mth). My old gym in DC was twice the cost but provided twice the service.  So for this price range and if you exclude the consideration of a kidzone, I would say the gym is average. There are better gyms in the Madison which are probably a better value compared to service but, you have to drive out in suburbs to go there... if you live anywhere near west, near east or downtown, this is probably your only choice for a full service fitness center. Until Capitol Fitness has a full service gym close by as it's competitive, we probably won't see much change.   \n\nThe Bright Side!\nThere are a lot of new big buildings going up in the next few years on the E. Washington Ave corridor so it will be just a matter of time until we'll see so other gym move into the area... It's up to Capitol Fitness Management to see if they can stay ahead and keep the gym relevant before people leave for something better...
4;If you like New York style pizza this place is a hidden gem in Downtown...Located across from the court house on Lewis & Casino Center, they are one of the best I have found in town.\n\nThey are open Monday through Friday only from 7am to 6pm, but if you can make it downtown during the week, this is a place to check out.  Parking is a bit of a challenge as there is no free public parking lot, but I tell you it is worth the trip.\n\nThey have lunch special's which run daily until 4pm which means 2 large cheese slices with a drink is only $5.50 until 4pm.\n\nEveryone I have talked to during my visit today has told me everything they have is excellent.  You won't find a bad item on the menu and Anthony is a very cool person to hang and chat with.  \n\nI highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed...
2;I'm a fan of the Hard Rock- great casino, great selection of restaurants and bars, and lots of good looking people. Stayed there earlier this week, and got upgraded to a ridiculous suite complete with a pool table, and 3 LCD tvs. It was pretty cool.\n\nS why only 3 stars? Paying $15 a day for internet is horse shit. If the Comfort Inn across the street can manage it for free, you should be able to as well. Pretty big turn off for business travelers. Has another problem with the TVs not working either, the people that had our room before had swiped the batteries and unplugged everything.
4;Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.
4;2011 International CES was all about 3D TVs, Mirrorless cameras, and tablets!\n\nThis was my first time attending and I really enjoyed it. The conventional center was so crowded and map was necessary if you were looking for specific companies but other than that just walk throughout the show and you'll have a great time. Not as much FREE STUFF as I expected but I got a lot of tote bags, pens, and some thumb drives. Also, they were giving away FREE NEW MINI REESES (CUPLESS!) by the entrance of the Central Hall. \n\nDEFINITELY WILL TRY TO GO AGAIN NEXT YEAR!
3;I actually end up spending more time here than I do at my actual apartment. I travel to Charlotte almost weekly for work, and the staff at this hotel is amazing. They are very personable, and extremely accommodating. This is nice to have, since I am rarely home.
1;En pensant \u00e0 ce que je voulais dire \u00e0 propos du March\u00e9 Bonsecours, je me disais un peu la m\u00eame chose que Virginie. C'est un tr\u00e8s bel \u00e9difice et de l'ext\u00e9rieur, il est assez impressionnant. Par contre, pour moi c'est l\u00e0 que \u00e7a s'arr\u00eate. \u00c0 chaque fois que j'y rentre, je trouve que \u00e7a deviens un centre d'achat trop chi-chi qui est fait pour les touristes riches seulement. On dit y exposer des oeuvres d'artistes qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et montr\u00e9alais, mais on dirait que toutes les choses se ressemblent et sont beaucoup plus dispendieuses qu'ailleurs. Allez-y si vous \u00eates en visite juste pour le voir, mais ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 \u00eatre impressionn\u00e9 \u00e0 part pour l'architecture du b\u00e2timent.
1;The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.
1;Meh. Is about the perfect way to describe this place. First, it's too expensive (I know it's Vegas, on the Strip, but improve quality if you're going to have such high cost). Food was okay at best. With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one.
1;Well as usual the rolled tacos lacked the quality of my first visit.  They were mushy in the middle and some parts of the tacos appeared maybe to not even been dipped into the fryer. The guacamole quality also not impressive this time and the cheese on the rolled tacos was not melted at all. Very concerned about prices for this item too as in most places you can get 5 of these for under 5 bucks always,  but they are 6.50 here with tax. Not worth it based on quality and not even a healthy dose of alcohol helped either.
0;Really high priced burgers for low end burgers and you have to pay 5 more for a combo it's not the cheapest eat in Vegas just the cheapest eat in planet Hollywood mall with horrible staff and serve yourself to tip them for nothing at the counter. Staff is not even happy at work and terribly rude when she was the one who messed up the order. Please just eat at chipotle when it opens at least you're guaranteed a certain quality of food. Worst 15 burger combo I spent.
1;Came here with two other people for wine and food pairing purchased through Living Social.  To cut to the chase...we had to share a table, waited over 30 minutes for the first pairing.  The wine given was barely 2 sips.  The food was mediocre, the wine same (Kendall Jackson) and the zinfandel with the desert was vinegar and we did not drink it.\n\nTo make things worst, they charged us a huge mandatory gratuity and tax.  \n\nLousy service, poorly executed event and overpriced for what we received.  No thanks, not coming back.
0;"AWFUL!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! DO NOT GO HERE!!! They painted, yes paint, like spray paint, my Hermes purse and a Chanel purse!!! I have been a loyal customer for 7 years.  I didn't want to wait for a professional \""spa treatment\"" for my purses so I figured I could come here for cleaning.  Being a loyal longtime customer I trusted his opinion and advise.  Owner John, said he could restore the color.  No problem.  I came to pick up my purse and was horrified to see it was painted.  When I questioned what was done he was very defensive and angry.  He kept saying it was beautiful to him.  Not listening to me the customer.  Didn't even want to listen to what I had to say.  I realized my best bet was to ask for store credit since I go there all the time.  He argued with me about that!  So I just left.  I will never go there again.  Not because of what happened to my bags, but because of the way he treated me.  After 7 years of loyalty, he couldn't set his pride aside and come to an agreement.  I am so disappointed and bothered by his customer service."
0;Cranky old man who has been in the business too long. If his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss. I would not recommend going to this man.
0;"I took my granddaughters to get our toes done and we were mislead to believe there was only one, very expensive price. After the ordeal, I wrote an appropriate letter to the owner, asking for compensation, and there was no response. I am willing to always give a positive yelp, but this was unconscionable. BUYER BEWARE! \n\nThis is what happened:\n \nMy two granddaughters and I arrived at Nail & Spa at about 5:30 PM, February 22, 2014. We picked our colors, and were invited to sit and start. There was some conversation about who I was, and what we were doing. I explained I was from California, and wanted to take them to get their nails done. After establishing who I was a where I was from, the people doing the pedicures continued to talk to each other, and every so often \""California\"" would pop out in their dialog with each other. This made it uncomfortable for us as we knew we were being talked about, but not talked to.\n\nThe conversation: \nWhile I was sitting there with my feet in the water, I explained I wanted a manicure, also. I said, \""Just a manicure, no nail polish.\"" Mia (I think that was her name) said, \""$37\"" (pointing at one granddaughter), \""$37\"" (pointing to the other granddaughter) and \""$47\"" (pointing to me). I went into shock thinking, \""Holy cow, what the heck is this place?\"" My mind was reeling with sticker-shock on this high-priced quote. My granddaughter mouthed to me, \""Did she say $37?\"" I nodded my head, yes. She was wide-eyed, also. I could not relax from that point on, nor could my granddaughter. It was like I was being financially raped. Mia kept asking me if it felt good while she was rubbing stuff on my legs. I was so consumed with the cost that all I could do was nod my head, and wonder why it was $37 to get a pedicure. The final insult was when she went to do my nails she whipped out a nail buffer, and started buffing without asking me. Then she says it will be $5 more. I did not even WANT my nails buffed. I have thin nails, and when you buff them, they fray apart. \n\nUpon leaving, my granddaughter asked the girl at the desk how much a pedicure is. She said, \""$23\"" (I believe) That was when I knew I had been taken advantage of. Mia did not offer the basic pedicure. She had only told us one option, and it was the most expensive. I believe this is bad customer service. My granddaughter is so upset; she does not want to go back there again for her brows. Both of my granddaughters insisted on giving me some money to compensate for the cost. That is NOT how that was supposed to turn out! \n\nI would NOT have posted this bad yelp if the owner had made it right, but I am writing this on April 23, 2014 and he has had plenty of time to respond. I cannot say that the pedicure was worth the price in any way. I was not happy with the actual pedicure work that was done, even if I was only paying the basic cost of $23.\n\nAll I can say is if a business practices these tactics, beware! Just look for better, more ethical places to clientele."
3;On our first visit, we tried the different tapas' on their happy hour menu and were not really impressed.\n\nWe came back last Sunday since I was craving for Paellla and it was a wonderful surprise that the food quality was totally different. We ordered Paella, Camarones Al Ajillo and Brochettas De Pollo and they were all good. The Camarones Al Ajillo I say is a must try. My bf almost licked the plate!\n\nWe will be back!
4;Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!
2;****Warning***** \nBe prepared to throw down with the other crazy customers for the best deals. LOL It can get a little nutty up in here. \n\nRule number one - NO Running! And they mean it. I can't count how many times I watched people run from the gates on Saturday morning to get the best s***. It's pretty comical, well until you see the woman with the infant running though the store, honey please, not worth it. \n\nI have found some amazing shoes, jeans and bags/belts here. The price is right for sure. The only down side is that Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack pretty much take anything back, so a lot of the stuff is used, worn and dirty. Be prepared to shift through a bunch of crap, but it can be worth it for that one great find every now and then. \n\nMust go on Saturdays! Show up a few minutes early to make sure to catch the show. The show being the crazy women waiting outside like a pack of wolves til the gate opens and then it's full sprint every man for themselves. Haha It's great!
2;not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.
3;The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.\n\nThe good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.\n\nI didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.
1;"I wish I could give them a better rating, but the staff here the other day really put me off. I had just gone for a run with a friend of mine who frequents this place. I told him what I was in the mood for (something cold and banana flavored) and he ordered. Whatever magic he ordered and was conjured up for me was delicious; I will admit that. However, my friend had somehow lost his debit card from when he paid to when we walked a block down the road. We went back in to look for his card, and the staff seemed incredibly lackadaisical. I realize it is not your responsibility, but come on kids, we had that card 30 min earlier. You could have helped search instead of standing around the counter playing on your iPhone. \n\nShame."
3;Great meal. Tom yum soup hits the spot on a cool day. \nLast couple trips here it seems the soup and entrees come out very close to each other. I would prefer to eat the soup before the entree arrives. \nBut a solid meal everytime.
4;This was our first time ordering from CCW and it was delicious!  I have been looking for a good Chinese place for years, and this one delivered...literally. We had the war won ton soup, sesame chicken, beef with broccoli and shrimp with snow peas and everything was delivered hot and delicious. It was also great to get the order we actually placed! Can't wait to try it again
2;Its a bit pricey but the dumplings and service are good.
1;As much as I try, I can't sink my teeth into Chicken Cottage at all.\n\nThey are always situated in downtrodden areas which don't endear them to me, and although this one isn't in the worst part of Edinburgh I can't shake that image. This branch is well kept and looks a bit nicer from the outside, but I still remain a bit wary of the food.\n\nChicken Cottage sells fast food at its fastest, and with that you know what to expect. I've never had a horrible meal from here since it's cooked properly, and it's cheap so it's better value for money than the likes of McDonalds, but even then it's not my favourite place to go. \n\nIt's not a relfection on the staff in this particfular branch, and I admire the way this franchise started out from humble beginnings in London. But I just can't warm to it, which is a matter of taste I guess. Not bad if you're looking for something ultra cheap, quick and easy, but it's a poor man's KFC with a hint of gloom about it. I don't know if it's because their shops seem to pop up in sketchy areas but at the end of the day it's just another fast food place.\n\nThe meat is halal though, which at least offers something a bit different that McDonalds and KFC can't.
2;I don't like this Urban Outfitters compared to the one in Milwaukee. It seems to have less clearance and non-clothing items.\n\nAnd their clearance items are **hardly** even on clearance. I can get shirts at the one in Milwaukee for $5. The clearance jeans hear (in the women's department) were $40. No freaking thank-you. \n\nMy boyfriend though, had a different shopping experience. Select Men's Levi's were on sale for $20 and he got a pair he was content with...\n\nNothing special, nothing horrible, A-OK.
4;Best Jewish deli and bakery in town. Awesome staff, amazing food and out of control baked goods. We try to go to Chompies' at least once a weekend for breakfast. My favorite is the All American with a Poinsettia (champaign and cranberry) to drink.
3;The jerk chicken fried rice was incredible and the red jade chicken was delicious and the perfect heat.  However, if you are trying to eat healthy, this isn't the place for you.
3;Coming from Vegas this is another thing I have come across in the Scottsdale area and wonder why this isn't there.  Prices were great twenty bucks for a haircut in a great atmosphere.  \n\nOf course hard to beat a two dollar a beer happy hour.  Which they will serve to you in the bar area or while you are in the chair,  \n\nThe guy who did my haircut was cool and was knowledgeable.  I imagine this will be where I go for my haircuts from now on.
1;"It took us 3 tries to eat at the Brink. The first was a Sunday and it was so empty that we figured, \""Do we gamble on an empty restaurant during peak brunch hours??\"" We decided not to and went somewhere else. The second time there was a Rape Crisis function happening. We came in on the tail end of it so we weren't greeted by any Brink employees to say, \""Hey, this is about to end. We'll get you set right up.\"" So we just went somewhere else. The third time was a Wednesday night. There were maybe 7 patrons in the place and a band setting up. We don't like to eat when we don't know what the music is going to be but it looked like it was going to take them awhile to set up and we didn't want to leave AGAIN so we sat at the bar for dinner. There was a small selection of decent draft beer. I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA...always a good beer. My dinner partner had a peach cosmo. Tasty in that \""Schnappsy\"" sort of way...nothing fresh about it. \n\nWe ordered the fondue because it was the only non-traditional bar food item on the menu. The flavor was right, good consistency but the selection of items to dip was not much to look at: broccoli, carrots (packaged mini-carrots), toasted bread and celery...yes, celery. We also ordered personal pizzas. I had the BBQ chicken and added Jalapeno...who doesn't. She had a Greek Pizza. Both were pretty good but again this place isn't trying to be real fancy. \n\nSo, make sure you check their calendar before you go...there seems to be a lot of functions at this place...and you might want to know what kind of music is going to be played before you show up. The blues rock band struck up just as we were finishing and they were playing to a table of what we could only assume were older friends and family. Someone's grandma was definitely getting her groove on. \n\nThe food will fill you up the way Wisconsinites expect to be filled...amply and without frill. No cheese curds on the menu...somehow."
1;"First timer, wasn't what I expected. We were seated right away but it took our server \""Amy\"" at least 15 minutes to acknowledge us and another 10 minutes to take our order. Our chips & water guy was way more attentive then Amy. \n\nAfter 45 minutes of total waiting we finally got our food, COLD. We questioned the server and she put  blame on lack of chefs in kitchen. We watched all the other servers walk by with their orders, no problem. Food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.\n\nIF we give it another try (most likely not) we will make sure its not with the server we got the first time."
0;Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow, 45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress.  Once at our table, we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table.  Waiter served the entrees and walked away, never checked to see how our meal was.  While tasty, the portions are small.\n\nUnfortunately, the best part of this restaurant is the valet service.  Don't frustrate yourself, dine elsewhere with friends.
1;as owners we checked in yesterday we were told that we could get a breakfast and a review a free buffet breakfast at the South Point casino they tried to spend like an hour trying to get us to upgrade our membership and got mad when we refused we bought show tickets and they tried to tell us that are free gift for going to the review was the show tickets which we have paid for and got mad about that too very unprofessional don't waste your time here it's to late for us you been warned
1;We were pretty excited when we first went to High Tide because of the recommendations on Yelp! Other than Ryu sushi that sits across the parking lot from High Tide, there isn't much in the way of really good seafood locally. The restaurant looks great and is adorned with high class appointments and a cool raw bar, but that was about where my attraction to High Tide ended. \n\nThe shrimp cocktail that came out clearly was a couple days old. When the shrimp starts to turn brown/grey at the ends, it's best not to serve it. The waitress kept forgetting portions of the order and when the food did come out, it hardly resembled the high cost of the meal. At the end of the day, if you are looking for a high end sea food experience, unfortunately you'll have to look elsewhere.
1;L'hamburger steak est ok  mais trop ch\u00e8re. Il commence \u00e0 4.50$ mais peut monter facilement \u00e0 une dizaine de dollars avec les extras. Le take out peut prendre facilement une quinzaine de minutes (pour un hamburger). Trop de boucane \u00e0 l int\u00e9rieur aussi lorsque il est en pleine production.
4;Staff is friendly and recognize you.  Great food and nice atmosphere.  Not fancy, but prefer that to a dress up type place.  Love taking family there as they can have pancakes and I can have gluten free French toast.  Wow!  Being GF sucks (food allergy not a preference), but places like this make me feel normal again.  Now a regular place we go for breakfast since moving to QC from Sacramento a month ago.   Thank you!
0;Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, is it really so hard to put the hollandaise on the side? That's what I asked for but that's not how my benedict came to me. Set in front of me with no apology like I just have to eat it this way or nothing. And that avocado mush - what is that? No flavor added to the bennie at all. Whatever - There won't be any more chances here. Really sorry - I tried to like you.
4;I love this family owned salon. Everyone is so friendly and nice and thoroughly skilled at doing good nails.  My gel nails last weeks with zero issues - no peeling or bubbling!!! Tiffany has a great eye too, I've gotten great recommendations for colors from her and her dad. You walk in and you are treated like a friend. So great :)
1;I only come here when I have those moments when  I think I need a haircut right then and there. I don't know why I have tortured myself and returned. 3 times I've been there. 3 times I've asked for short in back, long in front with a severe angle. 3 times I walked out with a plain jane bob. The employees *try* to make small talk but just end up talking to each other about how much they hate working there. \n\nAt the end of the day you get what you pay for- a cheap generic haircut.
4;Love this place!  It's a definite must every time i'm in vegas!  I always get the whole pie, half white sauce and half red sauce with sausage. Simple but amazing!  \n\nMy tips: Takes about 30 minutes or so for a whole pie, so don't come starving!
0;"Just returned from my last visit to Cafe Boa.  Let me describe the experience.  I arrive and am seated outside.  It's lovely out, so, that is a bonus.  I sit down to a filthy, paper menu.  Not so good.  Then I pickup my silverware wrap off my bread plate and the plate is dirty.  The waitress asks me for my drink order and I ask for sweetner with my tea.  She brings my tea and 2 packages of sugar.  I tell her I don't want sugar and she gives me some snide remark about it being the only thing they have and \""it is all natural.\""  All I wanted was some lousy Sweet'N Low.  Never got any bread and the waitress never noticed that I moved the dirty bread plate to the side of the table to get it replaced.  Oh well!  Next I order a salmon caesar salad.  It arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless.  I'm done.  The best part about the meal was the company.  I won't go there again.  I continue to wonder how they stay in business??????"
1;I used to enjoy the store because they had the best newsstand in the area. I don't know what happened but that is no longer the case. There are a lot of empty spaces and the magazines that are there are out of order. The newsstand is practically unshoppable. It's sad when I can go across the street to Target and get a better selection and more up to date selection of magazines. \n\nIn addition to the poor state of the newsstand they no longer carry music and DVDs. It is also difficult to locate new book releases. You are better off going around the corner to Barnes & Noble.
1;"The food is ok, not mind blowing. It's basically just snack food not real meals. I'd call it a classier Mc Donald's. I purchased a \""refillable souvenir cup\"" but I had to pay $1.00 each time I refilled it. Can you say false advertisement."
3;Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.
1;We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok.
1;"A little better overall.  \n\nI went here again at the request of my wife today, and I was curious if there was going to be any improvement in this place since my last, horrible visit.  I can definitely say that the customer service was FAR FAR better--someone actually asked me if I needed help!  That was good.  The place felt quite a bit more alive than the last time I was here.  A recent review of this place by another Yelper described it as \""a tomb.\""  Last time I was here, yes.  This time, at least at the time I visited, no.\n\nBut let's cut to the chase--the reason why you visit a bookstore is, well, BOOKS!  Customer service only goes so far if what you carry is no good (and this is true for many kinds of businesses.)  I have been to a number of metaphysical stores in my day both in California and Arizona, and this one still stinks in their book selection.  Sure, the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it.  But, you need MORE than that.  Either the owner or the book buyer or both need to visit Alpha Book Center, Fantasia, and Northern Winds in Phoenix to find out what kind of inventory a REAL METAPHYSICAL BOOKSTORE really has in stock.  This place has enough space to carry the full book inventory of all three of these stores combined--if it did, they'd get a LOT more business from Wiccans, New Agers, and Occultists of all different stripes who would go there to get the stuff they need.  Bulk herbs would be another nice addition--all they have are the same-old same-old incense sticks and oils.  \n\nInstead of aiming to be a provider to the metaphysical community in the Valley (and this is an ample community), they seem to be relying on their tarot card readers, psychics, authors, presenters, and aura photographers to bring in the bucks.  Good, but not good enough.\n\nA little better overall.  Come on Vision Quest!  You guys have the space and the potential--now DO SOMETHING with it!"
0;"I am expressing my great DISAPPOINTMENT with the service I received from The District in October 2009.  \n\nIn the beginning of October, I approached The District to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a Thursday night at around 10:30 p.m..  Not only did they say it would be great, they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests. And also, the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday, so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District.  Thursday night came, the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was HORRIBLE!  The way he treated me, others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember.  NOT only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously The District could not do so, nor did the management team care to do so.   The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER, the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming! ...for seating, passing out menus..the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they couldn't,  some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $15, there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine, I never I saw the menu, but I do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $15 a pop! The manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him, individuals can not get drink specials at the bar, however, there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied.   Also, the executive director of the non profit organization that I work for had ordered just a Dr. Pepper, he gave the bartender a $20, received the drink and never received his change, when he asked the bartender, the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change.  HE HAS YET TO RECEIVE HIS CHANGE FOR A DR. PEPPER.  \n\nI never received a thank you for bringing people to The District that night.  IT WAS VERY DISORGANIZED AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM AT THE DISTRICT.  \nAlso, the manager had said to me and the executive director  that we would receive free valet parking since we were at The District, we had to pay over $40 for parking.   It was a very frustrating night.\n \nBottom line, we truly did not feel welcome at The District.  I was put in the predicament where I had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed.  At one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at The District, bringing over 100+ guests, but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff, I am now reconsidering ever utilizing The District and the Sheraton. As for myself, I was very disappointed and had expected great service.\nTHIS IS THE FUNNY PART!  I did receive (a week later) an email from Heinrich Stasiuk, District GM.  Very insincere apology, THE FUNNY PART...he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating I was difficult (sorry but you promise me certain things, should be able to keep it!) also stated in the email \""but they made good money from us\"" .if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners, I hope either you reconsider or let them know you've read my review!  Since I was difficult, I'm sure they will remember me and the fact they probably made about $3000+ off of my guests."
4;Excellent customer service, wonderful and consistent food every time we come here. Definitely the best Brazilian style steakhouse in Las Vegas.
0;This review is for the Phoenix Airport Location.\nI wish I could give the establishment and endless supply of negative stars, but alas...one will have to do! Currently renting a Jeep Wrangler from Fox for a 10 day road trip. Thought it was going to be a smooth ride but unbeknownst to us we got SLAMMED with additional fees! Beatriz made several up sells that seemed like they were for the week, when in fact they are for the day. My hat is off to her, she is a good saleswoman, and should probably start selling used cars...she could make a fortune. Going further, their customer service is horrible over the phone. We were transferred several times, each time the person on the other end of the phone knew less and less. The only thing we did find out was you can not change or cancel any of the add-ons over the phone. My advice to everyone is go with a company that treats you with respect, and does not take full advantage of you. Go with a reputable company like Enterprise. Fox should change their name to Wolf.
0;Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
2;I went to the Pancake Cafe this morning(Sat) for a group breakfast (11 people).\nFacility--A+\nCleanliness--A\nHostess---A\nService--C-\nFood--C+\nValue--C-  Prices about 25% higher than scale for Madison\nOverall Experience--B\n\nThe only thing I didn't like there was that they add an automatic 20% surcharge as they do not trust people to leave a TIP on their own--I find this off-putting \n\nThe staff seemed very friendly but our server clearly had too many tops and did not have the time needed to even refill one cup of coffee.
4;I love this Port of Subs! The staff is very friendly and make me feel at home. Everything is very neat and clean and I always get what i want. I have been going here for several years now and the staff changes pretty often but everyone is always nice. I would recommend this place over any other locations.
1;"This evening my friend and I thought, \""let's go to bonefish grill\"" we researched it on yelp and the presentation looked awesome.  Unfortunately the presentation and the waiter  were the only thing awesome. \n\nI tried the \""Ahi Bowl\"" and my friend tried the\""Chilean Sea Bass\"" the Ahi  bowl was a bit off in color and the Sea Bass tasted like it was soaked in petrol. \n\nOn the bright side we did enjoy each others company and a great bottle ofSanta Margarita Pinot Grigio!!!\nThat's really all that mattered!!!\n\nFood is definitely subpar!!!\n\nDamn I really did want to like this place!!!!"
4;I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh.
2;"Stopped by this place after seeing it on a walk, made a night out of it for a birthday. We arrived before they got busy, so our lack of reservation wasn't an issue and we were seated immediately. Seriously impressive wine menu; their website's claim to \""wine bible\"" was justified. The bruschetta was nothing to write home about, their mushroom pan fry was tasty, but had a bit too much filler. The meat on the \""Smoke, Sugar, Shank\"" was cooked perfectly, but the beans were cold and tasteless and the whateverelse it came with wasn't memorable. The highlight of the night was definitely the desserts. The birthday cake of the night was a dark chocolate raspberry affair, and the taste was divine, even if the seeds added to an unusual texture. We sampled the ice cream trio with Orange Blossom, Chocolate Chunk, and Pickled Watermelon, and were extremely pleased. Three scoops of ice cream on a plate didn't seem enough to justify a $10 price tag, but with places like this it's to be expected. The desert wine was lovely after they filtered the cork out of my first glass. All in all a good meal, punctuated by occasional disappointment."
3;"Not the best, but better than most.\n\nOk, to be honest, the first time I came here, it wasn't really by choice.  I was actually headed to the place next door (if you've been here, you know what restaurant I'm talking about) but my reservation was \""denied.\""  So, being hungry and unwilling to wait 2 hours to be seated, the wife and I reluctantly walked over to Seoul Oak.  We were one of two tables seated.  At 7pm.  On a Friday.  I had second thoughts, but...\n\nThe waitress was so polite and helpful, we decided to give it a shot.  And we were impressed.  We ordered off the all you can eat menu and then proceeded to stuff ourselves silly.  The side dishes seemed never-ending!  The big bone kalbi is a must, though the meat could be served thicker.  My favorite is the spicy pork, which has slightly sweet notes as you start eating, but the heat builds and next thing you know you had two bowls of rice.  \n\nThe food was delicious and relatively authentic (compared to the \""Americanized\"" or more trendy eateries).  We even took a kid from Korea (on a later visit) who said the food was like how his mom makes.  Seriously.  But on a recent visit (maybe two or three weeks ago) we noticed that some of the menu items tasted differently.  Maybe a new cook?  Maybe they just changed the recipes?  It wasn't bad, but a surprise.  \n\nThe place is very unassuming, and I'm not sure if they even have a sign (in English...if you're going West to East on Spring Mtn., I know there is a sign in English).  But come here for straight up Korean food that is filling and tasty."
2;Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.  \nThe drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.
0;I hated the fact the texture of the gelato was so sticky and thick. I felt naucious and got a stomach ache from it. I feel like they put way too much sugar in their icecream creating such inconsistent texture. I'm going to baskin Robbins next time.
3;I went on a busy Saturday night with my husband.  We didn't call to make a reservation until just before we left... got in at 8:45 -- our fault for not calling.  We showed up early to enjoy the bar, crowded but still comfortable.  Excellent drinks (you could actually tell there was alcohol in them!)  We got a table earlier than 8:45 and sat down.  We were happy to see the pricing was reasonable.  The only downside the whole evening was that the dining room was as loud as the bar -- but we were still impressed with the FOOD.\n\nI had the squash soup (OHHH SOOO GOOOD) and my husband had the house salad (excellent) (both only $2 to add to our entrees).  I ordered the special of the evening, mixed grill and got to taste 3 separately delicious dinners -- generous portion for the $18 pricetag.  Fish with an excellent sauce, sausage and creamy polenta, and some rotisserie chicken.  All excellent, when I go back I'll probably get the rotisserie chicken - YUM. My husband had the hanger steak.  It had a guijilla (sp?) sauce that he loved and the meat was tender and deliciously prepared. ($18? as well)\n\nWe loved it and can't wait to return with some friend for an evening out (just don't forget the reservation!)
3;OMG this place is great.  I have only ever been like 2 or 3 times when I was younger.  I went with my Dad and some stuff is over priced, but it all depends on what you buy and how fast you're gonna use it/eat it.  \n\nTheir ready made foods are INCREDIBLE.  We found some yummmmmmmmmy jumbo shrimp salad and it was a huge portion for the price and got some chicken salad that was just as good.  I bought some fresh baked large chocolate chip cookies (similar to what you find at albertsons) but these were 10x better. They are GREAT.  Their fresh made sushi dept had better portions and better prices then the grocery store AND better quality.  They weren't as good as being at an actual sushi bar of course but definitely better then the typical grocery store variety.   We also finished up with a hot dog and a drink for $1.50 and it was HOT and very yummmy.\n\nThis place was absolutely packed both in the parking lot and inside, and I could totally see why.  I will definitely go back again for a variety of items.\n\nOh btw.... Checking out was FAST too. It definitely wasn't like a busy Wal-mart where only a few lanes were open.  They had every lane open and people boxing your stuff up and you were in and out of that checkout line in just a few quick minutes.  \n\nThe only thing I think they could improve on is extend their hours a little later into the evening. They close too early and people aren't always off work to be in and out of costco by 6 pm
2;Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.
4;At Cravings, they have a variety of food from  different kinds of seafood to Italian to a variety of meats and a whole Asian section (including won ton soup, sushi and Pho) and indeed this place was satisfying my cravings!  The Crab Legs were so addicting! I first had a whole plate and then went for seconds. The shrimp was good because it was already peeled and ready-to-eat. The Prime Rib was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS! :) The Seafood Cioppino was done right but may be a little spicy for some people. But I thought it was alright! \n\nFor dessert, try the NY Cheesecake with Dark Chocolate Shavins (they have a bunch of in dividual cheesecakes). It was so good! Also the hand-scooped ice cream (try the Hazelnut!) was so delicious. They have a  time that they have for Crepes and once it closes, it closes.\n\nService we got here was great and I don't think no one else could have done a greater job like our waiter Alberto did! Changed plates, gave us drinks when we wanted a refill. Awesome job.
4;I had the tabouli salad here over a year ago and when my boss said lets eat at the Arrogant Butcher that's all I could think of. I had it again today and again....Amazing! We topped it with this peanut butter dessert!! Can u say wow??
1;"Over the past few months, the service has gotten worse.  Upon reading some of the recent comments, I'm seeing the same issues with inconsistency.\n\nUsually there's something wrong with the order.  For example, we ordered the \""spot\"" chicken tonight with no bacon or onions and add avocado.   It came with bacon, onions and no avocado.  How do you mess that up?\n\nSometimes it'll come with a fries instead of a salad, even though the menu says it clearly comes with salad.    \n\nThe food is mediocre at best and when the order isn't right, it's just not worth it anymore."
3;Quick, helpful, and clean  what else do you want?
4;Awesome happy hour! Their microbrewed beers are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday Night Football.) They also have $2 well drinks and wine as well as a great selection of bar food for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with coffee beans and cocoa nibs. It was a delicious and different bittersweet ale with coffee and chocolate overtones. The service was friendly and fantastic!\n\nWe were only there for drinks this trip but will definitely return for more awesome beer and to try some of the yummy bar food!
3;Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean.
0;"Didn't like anything.  Yeah, I said it.  I  didn't enjoy Lotus of Siam.  After all of the hype I was really disappointed with this place.  I didn't like the food and can't believe people actually wait in line for this place.  \n\nI can appreciate an \""Old School Gem\"" but this place is just old. What a dump!  This hole in wall is in a terrible area of town too.\n\nNot a fan and will never return.  \n\nMy taste buds deserve better~"
2;Good soup, if I am stranded in summerlin I know exactly where to go if I want a Thai version of Pho.
1;"So much on the menu here is just too needlessly expensive. Another victim of the \""Hey it's Vegas, charge 75% more than that would cost anywhere else\"" mentality. In my opinion, you're better off hogging as many free chips as you can (the three salsas were well liked by everyone) and ordering a salad. That formula should get you full enough while being budget friendly. The salad I got was the Watercross, Avocado and Orange salad. It was delicious once I got rid of the avocado. It came with three bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese that created a flavor fiesta in my mouth. We had a nice outdoor table on a patio that overlooked the impressive Mandalay Bay pool. The restaurant is tucked in the very back of Mandalay Bay like it's some kind of ugly duckling."
1;"Ate here last nite. Ordered Masaman curry with only vegetables, my friend ordered silver noodles with shrimp. My curry was not that good to heavy, and thick. vegetables were lacking not too many. And the few vegetables that were in the curry were diced up very thinly and overcooked. very disappointing. I ordered brown rice which costs $2. And the small bowl was not even full. less than half full. my friend said his silver noodles were just ok. vegetables were overcooked. and their were not much noodles. The manager or owner or both came over and sat at our table to ask us how we liked our food. I metioned about the vegetables and my friend metioned about the overcooked veggies. and She was very gracious and asked us to come back and to make a special  request as to how we want the food. That was refreshing and made us feel validated. \n\nBefore we went to eat their we called to find out if they used MSG and the person on the phone said that \""no they did not use MSG\"" so with that we decieded to go there to eat. \n\nI found out they do use MSG. As I woke up last nite with a splitting headache the type of headache I only get if I consume MSG. \n\nIt sad because I wanted to give this place another try. however I don't think I will return they use MSG and that is poison and it makes me sick."
0;I don't understand why people would like this place..... this place is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the broth!!!! gosh!!!!! it was disgusting. it has that weird smell..... and that roast pork!!! gosh is that roast pork!!!!??? do they know what roast pork is!!!??? now it makes me feel like yelp is unauthentic!!!!!
4;My happy place, and one of the best parts of Phoenix. I have an annual membership because I come here so frequently. PAM gets big draws for national exhibits and has some remarkable names in possession. We truly have a world class art museum, here, folks!!!  Go. You'll be happier than Pharrell in the moments before he lost the Oscar. Go! Go!
4;I booked rooms for my mom and my uncles at this local B&B for the weekend of my wedding.  They had a fantastic time here.  \n\nThe Parador is located in the middle of the business district of Allegheny West on the North Side of Pittsburgh, which makes it extremely convenient to PNC Park, Heinz Field, the North Side museums, and downtown cultural events.  The inn takes up an entire beautifully-restored brick Victorian-era house, and also the carriage house in back.\n\nA really nice man named Ed runs the Parador, together with his cute Black Lab, Razor.  (Razor is perfectly trained and quite the gentleman -- there is also a stash of treats for him in the B&B's kitchen, if you can't resist slipping him something.)  Ed was so gracious and such a wonderful host that I ended up feeling sort of bad that I hadn't known about this place before, because I would totally have gotten married there!\n\nThe inn itself is absolutely beautiful.  The entire interior has been completely renovated, but with furnishings and other decorations that remain in keeping with the Victorian style of the building.  The guest rooms are not rooms, but huge, luxurious suites (the smallest of the guest rooms is a 328-square-foot room - bigger than many studio apartments), and the common areas are welcoming and comfortable.  This B&B has the typical amenities (in-room TV, phone, coffee maker, full American-style breakfast each morning, wireless access, hair dryers and laundry stuff, little fridges) with some bonuses you don't always see (the decanter of port on top of the piano in one of the common rooms, the giant full private bath in each of the rooms, a conservatory room).  There is no gym in the house itself, but you can get a free pass to the Allegheny YMCA (only about three blocks away, and a pretty great institution in its own right).\n\nPrices to stay here are shockingly low at $150/night.  This is the same price you would pay to stay at a chain hotel, getting a fraction of the space and none of the individualized attention, impeccable hospitality, or unique style you will find here.\n\nYou should stay here if you're coming in from out of town.  I fully intend to stay here if I ever feel inclined towards a miniature romantic getaway or something.  It's a pretty great spot.
3;Things it seems we can all agree on: the service is a little slow. Maybe leaning towards a lot slow. And probably verging on unfriendly (unless you're Friends of Friends. Yay for F-of-F!)\n\nThings I like that we apparently may disagree on: place is non-smoking! Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.\n\nNow, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\n\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\n\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston. Luckily, I can get re-aligned over the coming months! Pittsburgh pricing is rad. This place is rad. No smoking is rad. And the low-key winter is rad when compared to how much of a crush eating here can be in nice weather.
4;"Love this place! \n\nI was lucky enough to be invited to Yelp's Craftacular, and had so much fun getting to play with some of their supplies- from pretty holiday paper to decorative paper punches to the embossing heat tool.\n\nIt was great to see how much the staff loved working their crafty magic with the supplies as we made our way around to the 3 different crafting tables. We got to create an embossed wine bottle gift tag (or a door knob decoration if you like), a gift tag with a pop-out ornament on it, and our very own Holiday Card and envelope.\n   \nOnce upon a time, I loved to do paper crafts like card making, but have since gotten too busy. But being at Paper Source reminded me of all the reasons I loved doing it before, and I can't wait to start doing some more again.\n\nThe whole store is like a Wonderland of Paper Craft Supplies as well as awesome novelty gifts and cards. So there really is something for everyone- whether you want to buy a cute gift or card... or buy the supplies to make something yourself, they have it all.\n   \nI also really appreciated speaking with store manager Emily who talked a little bit about the store's dedication to the environment (their Paper Source products are made from at least 30% post-consumer waste).\n\nTheir prices are moderate- very comparable to other paper goods stores. For all of the products they offer, the store is very organized and easy to find what you're looking for. The staff obviously loves what they do and are happy to share creative ideas. And they offer lots of classes (which apparently book up quickly), in case you need a jump-start for your creativity.\n\nTheir motto is \""Do something creative every day\"" and they really are the \""Source\"" to help get you started on that journey!"
4;I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!
2;"Overall, we had a great time at Harrah's. Seriously, who doesn't have a good time in Vegas? The first room we had (we were talked into upgrading for $15 more per night) was on the 14th floor in the Mardi Gras tower above the pool. This was a mistake. We were told there was a band that played outside until about 2am. Well, the band lasted well after 4:00am. We thought we wouldn't be able to hear it, but we did, LOUD and clear. After a sleepless night, we (with the help of the fabulous Courtnie) changed to the 12th floor on the \""quiet side.\"" Quiet my butt! All day/night long we could hear the squeaky elevator gears. It was almost as loud as the band. Because we didn't want to change rooms again, we dealt with it (with pillows over our ears) for the remainder 2 nights. \nAll in all, I would recommend 1) not upgrading and 2) making sure you want the quiet side NOT by the elevators (in the Mardi Gras tower)\nIn terms of overall experience at Harrah's - the staff is all super nice! From Courtnie at Check-in, to the waitresses, to the ladies at the gift shop - they have all nailed customer service! I would have to say, however, the drink ladies are sparse. Go to the $1 machines and they'll be by every few minutes. Go to the penny machines and you'll be waiting up to 20 minutes.\nDEFINITELY sign up for their Total Rewards card. You can use it at a ton of their sister properties for just about anything - from food, to drinks, to swag. I've seen other people say they get free rooms, but we didn't. We must not have gambled enough. \nOverall, we will keep Harrah's in mind next time we visit Vegas. \n\nPS Try Ice Pan. Super yummy ice cream made right in front of you!"
4;RECOMMENDED: 4 words...  Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf!  I've eaten at the North Scottsdale location before and loved it. Being a creature of habit, I usually ordered the Wolfpack. This visit changed all of that. I ordered Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf and it is absolutely amazing!  I tasted why it's an award winning entr\u00e9e. Trust me and your taste buds can thank me later!\n\nI liked it so much, I visited the North Scottsdale location 2 days later and ordered it again!\n\nOne thing worth pointing out is consistency runs true at both locations. The service is top notch.  The restaurant is buzzing with energy and the staff rocks.
1;I went back to the Rio to change and get a quick bite, and this place looked safe. Run of the mill as it gets, but the prices are a total joke. It's a burger and fries, for 14 bucks! If I pay 14 bucks for a burger and fries at a walk up joint, it should at least be sufficiently kick ass. Not at all.
0;"Very rude service, I genuinely felt I that wasn't wanted here.\n\nThe waitress barely said more than 7 words to me, \""Know what you want?\"" and \""Take a seat.\""\n\nThe food was okay. I got the lunch special; the waitress dropped a bowl of soup on my table without saying what it was. No spoon. No refills.\n\nToo many better places to go in this area to waste a visit here, especially with the award winning Carlito's Burritos across the street.\n\nOh, and I got food poisoning too."
1;The reason for 2 stars.  Order accuracy!  My food has been wrong the last 3 times!  I ordered 3 quesa tacos for my lady and me.  We ordered 2 shrimp and 1 carnitas.  We got  2 beef and 1 carnitas.  The server said the ticket was correct.  This is the third time this happened!  Don't get me wrong, the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time.
0;"Zero stars. Really disappointed at the \""deal\"" we got for pizza. Pizza is marginal at best and felt we got sold a bill of goods as we spent way too much for what we got."
1;Basic breakfast.. nothing really spectacular or bad.. just so so.. the walnut pastry was kind of dry and the service was rushed and disinterested.
2;So we are HGVC time share owners and we have stayed at all of the Vegas properties. I would say that as far as the properties themselves, this would rank in the middle between the Flamingo and he one on the strip. The strip being the best of them all. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very nice property and relatively new. The staff is very nice and friendly. The biggest plus for us with these properties is the fact that we have a kitchen. We have an infant and boy does the fact that you can just warm up water when you want to warm the milk bottle just make your life easier. \n\nI guess you can get similar amenities at other suite type residence but I have always been pretty happy with the Hilton HGVC. I would recommend this place for families but not for bachelor or bachelorette parties. This is a family oriented hotel. Not really meant for single. Remember, there is no casino on the property. There is the Hilton Las Vegas within walking distance.. maybe 1/2 block away.. \n\nOverall, I like this place..
3;I went to this place after work yesterday around 4:30ish to get a simple pedi. Lady who helped me was nice enough, didn't bother to small talk which was fine with me. She was a little rough when messaging my legs. I got a classic pedi with callus removal, it was the most effective callus removal treatment I have ever had. Classic pedi was $20 plus $5 for the callus removal, price is reasonable, I will return.
3;One of the best pizza on in Montreal. \nVery fresh and tasty ingredients.\nDecor is interesting and staff is attentive.\nVery nice experience overall.\n\nTips: Ask the staff which wine to get. It worked very well for us.
1;if you want to fit in san tan valley here is a step by step guide.\n\n1. be really proud of yourself for buying a super cheap house in the middle of nowhere. but don't tell anyone the location bc the moment you do people are less impressed.... and more turned off. \n\n2. bc of #1, you can afford rims on your car. be sure to buy the ugliest  ones possible. people here prefer black rims with chrome outline.\n\n3. roll down your windows\n\n4. tune your radio to rap music \n\n5. blast it really loud\n\n6. drive with your left arm only, straight out, and lean back. be sure you wear your wrist watch on this arm so that others can see it out your window. bonus points if you wiggle your wrist pretending to adjust the watch, but really you just want it to sparkle under the light.\n\nim not exaggerating, we saw about 10 different cars like this while eating our china chef. \n\n(i just checked out someone's profile who lives in san tan valley. first person i clicked on listed interest: purple drank. what are the chances? i rest my case.)\n\nthis whole review is an embarrassment, but it must be said. \n\ndon't ask why i was in this part of town last night, but i was. and we were waiting for a long time in this shopping center and hadn't had dinner. china chef of burger king? china chef it is! \n\nthe food wasn't disgusting, actually it was just meh but edible and better than BK (on 2nd thought, maybe if i find myself in that horrible town/shopping center i will do BK). the space was clean and blah blah blah.  \n\nthat's not the problem. the problem is that the meal doesn't come with a gas mask for later. and my body wasn't the only one having issues with this food. for the record, i've eaten my fair share of questionable food and i have never had a reaction like this. \n\nshhuuuuuuuuu-weeeeeeeee.
1;My husband had the new 5-cheese Mac and Cheese with chicken. Looked pretty good and he said it was tasty.\n\nI however had the tried-and-true baby back ribs. Awful! Very dry to the point the meat was very cooked down and the ends were all but burned. They didn't even try to cover it up with globs of bbq sauce, which is a common stunt. Very BLEH... Won't ever get the ribs there again and highly dis-recommend them from others. Ew.
0;Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!
2;"Three stars = A-OK.  It was fine.  It wasn't great.  This place has been here for about 30 years.  Before that it was a car wash.  I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.\nAnyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the \""Classic\"" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar.\nWe got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce.  Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it).  Mu-shu pork - it was good.  Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it.  Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck.  Very crispy, as in dry.  Not so great.\nThe kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies.  The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative.  Extra help came out when needed."
3;At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.
0;Running out of Gyros on a thursday night ?? really ?? extremely disappointing. we came for their main dish and they ran out of it.
2;Food was okay, service was okay, the whole experience was okay. \n\nEverything was plain nothing out of the ordinary. I really expected more when I came here to dine considering the relatively expensive prices for all of their meats (compared to other the higher priced places in Vegas), STK did not compare. Prime has much better steak at better prices, quality and portions. Also tried out their tuna, it was alright very much on the bland side even with the sauce, I felt like asking for soy-sauce (but that would've been weird). The only part of the entire meal that stood out were the parmesan truffle fries which were perfectly done to the right crispiness. \n\nThe ambiance is quite loud, not the best place to take someone out for a romantic date as it's hard to even hear yourself. Fun place to hang out with friends to drink and eat though. \n\nService was spotty, it was often times hard to flag down someone to refill waters or to even request simple utensils which was a bit frustrating but it was jam packed at the time so I'll cut them some slack.
4;If you have a gianormous tree to be trimmed, these are the guys to do it.  Friendly, low cost, and did a fantastic job.  I had a large palo verde and eucalyptus tree (2 stories high) to trim and they have the right knowledge and tools to get the job done.  They even picked up some extra debris in my yard!  Thanks H&S!
1;It was okay.  Can't compare to Ike's sandwich.  I had the pastrami rueben, very disappointed... Not even two layers of meat.   My sandwich was sad, which made this visit and experience sad.  Line was long and wait after ordering was long, you would think that the long wait meant good food, but it was completely opposite.\n\nA second visit would require me to be completely wasted.
3;Great meat fish market...clean and friendly service!
3;Atmosphere: B  (no music so created a abort of akward silence at times)\n\nService: A - very attentive and helpful\n\nFood: delicious!\n\nPrice: B (a bit high for portions but not a deal breaker)
4;It's tough to find quality Vegan food when you don't know the area. Came to Vegas on business. Googled Vegan Las Vegas and this came up as one of the choices.  It was awesome!!  The family atmosphere, the very friendly service and the best vegan sushi I have ever had.
0;"I'm not one to write a bad yelp normally as I understand how damaging they can be. My negative review of the budget rent a car at the Phoenix airport is mainly about the rudest individual working there that I have ever come in contact with. We picked up our car at 145pm on Friday, November 7, 2014.  I made our reservation through costco travel as I do most times when we go somewhere as their rates are the best. I had my confirmation loaded in my trip it App on my phone. Their system at this location of taking a number and being seated to wait your turn was great! No standing in line, instead comfortably seated in the waiting area waiting for your number to be called. This took about 15 minutes. Not horrible. Unfortunately my pleasant experience ended there. I was asked to go to a window where agent Barb was to help me. She was unable to locate our reservation. I showed her my confirmation on my phone and she immediately told me it was not their confirmation number. I advised that I had booked through costco to which she rudely responded, \""we aren't the only company they use, try next door\"". I assured her the reservation was with budget but she insisted I was mistaken and again suggested I go next door. I began looking through my emails to find the confirmation to see if it included budgets confirmation number. When I found the email, I handed over my phone to her. She scrolled through it then shoved my phone in my face and said, look, this is OUR confirmation number not the other one you gave me. What difference does it make? Do you have a reservation or not? She was now able to locate the reservation and proceeded. Never was there an apology or explanation. Next I had to endure what can not be described as anything other than badgering me into additional insurance. I understand they encourage their workers to do this and may even bonus them on their success in some way. I get that. But when I say no thank you six times, I truly don't want it! She went on to make me feel like a degenerate for not taking it as it could cost tens of thousands of dollars if something were to happen. This is easily at least the hundredth car I've rented over the years and I'm very clear on the risk of using my own insurance over theirs. I didn't need schooling from this rude individual. I would definitely rent from budget again as everything other than barb was terrific. Just a heads up if you find yourself at this location standing in front of barb, I'd suggest passing your turn and waiting for the next agent!"
1;I had high hopes for this place but in the end, I did not have a great experience here. I went to collage a decade ago in Madison and Ginza was a thriving restaurant then. My memories of the hibachi here were very fond. Returning to Madison, I rarely get out to the west side, but I decided to make the trek out here to try it again.\n\nWalking into the restaurant, the place looked relatively slow. My wife and I I were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a hibachi table. We went to the bar and decided to order some sushi as an appetizer. After 30 minutes, we had not received our sushi and we were still sitting at the bar. I can understand if it is a busy Saturday night. This was a Tuesday night with about 15 people total in the restaurant. The hostess was less than courteous to say the least. When we finally received our sushi, we were told our table was ready.\n\nWe sat down at the hibachi table with some other strangers since it was just my wife and I. The hibachi performance was not inspiring and the food was bland. The sushi was decent. I read in the other reviews that sodas did not include free refills, but I did not test this.\n\nGinza has lost its luster and I won't be returning.
0;This review might sound a little repetitive but I feel future customers need to hear it again and again...\n\nThey really offer you nothing for your jewelry. I went there with a Cartier ring and a custom made necklace. I was offered less than the weight of the gold. I understand that they need to make money to stay in business, but damn don't take us for the ride of our lives! Just to confirm my suspicions, I drove down the street to one of those pawn superstores for giggles and they offered me more for the necklace alone than that jewelry store.\n\nBottom line, know what you have before selling it, no matter where you go! And this is certainly not the place to go to if you want to walk away with some decent cash in your pocket.
2;A good friend took me over , he praised this place for so long, I was expecting, I guess a bit too much.\nSaturday late morning, the restaurant wasn't Yet even half full.\n\nA confused waiter, messed our drinks order maybe 3 times. And all we wanted was coffee and tea. (Where the hell did places in this town got the habit of getting your coffee without a spoon, and when you dare ask them for one you get the feeling from them As if you are insane)\n\nAn appetizer , stuffed mushrooms with spinach was mediocre at best, in some kind of white wine sauce (I guess?) .\nPasta la chef with seafood & Alfredo , again , mediocre. Ate maybe half, took the rest home and dumped it righ when I got home.\n\nI did like the decor.
1;I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return.
0;Not sure why this place gets high marks.  During March Madness, as a tradition, my buddies come here to get a quality steak.  So, I've been here a few times, so I think I didn't have an unfortunate bad experience.  I know my steaks, having been to several high end places across the country.  The view is great.  That's about it.  Service has been terrible every time.  Servers have a mafia attitude and are the most snobbish of all of Vegas.  This was for every time I come here.  Then it took forever to get our appetizers and then our meal.  Then the steak.  Aged.  And it taste like it.  Seems to have a spoiled after taste and was tough.  Every time.  I guess most people pay a high price and need to rationalize that they got a great meal.  Then the price is higher than most quality steak places.  It took a few years to convince my friends to try some place different.  Now they agree with me that other places are much better.  I expect for the price to get superb service and a great steak.  I haven't seen it here yet.
1;We've eaten here before and been pleased with the food, although the service has been slow. This evening, however, we walked out after sitting for nearly ten minutes without so much as an acknowledgement from a server. Even a simple wave as indication that we'd been noticed would have been an improvement.\n\nThe food is good, but I can get good food at any number of places in town. The service here is just not good enough for me to recommend them to anyone else.
3;The Hero Factory is 2 minutes from my office, good for my foodie obsession, bad for my waisteline.  This place has absolutely one of the biggest heros I've had.  $10 will get you a hero and a drink.  A little pricey but I can never eat the whole thing and that means lunch the next day too.
3;Not to brag but I am  one of the lucky people to really have Xiaolong Bao in Shanghi at Yu Gardens. This place does a nice job, and the choices of fillings is really fun and not an option at the famous dumpling shop. The biggest difference though is the wrapper. Here they are too dry and often have a hole in them. Never the case in Shanghi. I also miss the sauce, black vinegar with ginger and sesame oil.\n  All criticism aside, I have never had any closer outside of China. It's American prices but it's in America. Shanghai's run $1 for 15.
4;A great combination of pool hall and italian bistro.  The coffee was very good and I will be going back to try the tiramisu!
0;small slices, I have been to sbarro all over the place, but this by far was yuckkkkkkk. \n\nI asked where the cheese and pep slices were and the guy said hidden.  Before I could even reply he said i keep the pricy stuff out for show.  I told him good business but im not there for the stuffed pizza so break out the plain stuff and lets roll. \n\nThe small slices were warm at best and didn't have much taste, but after 5 hours at a car show with no food or drink this will do.
4;"There aren't enough good things I can say about Popo's.  My husband and I are locals who have the choice of dozens upon dozens of Mexican restaurants, and we always choose Popo's.  We don't even consider going anywhere else.  The food is awesome, the prices are very reasonable, and the service is great.  It's where we take our out-of-town guests, where we celebrate any occasion, and its always the choice for \""let's do lunch\"".  They have recently opened a location at 59th Ave & Bell and the food is exactly the same.  Hubby likes the enchiladas and, me, I'm a machaca girl myself.  Go there!  You won't be sorry!"
0;This is simply a Holiday Inn in disguise- don't expect anything more (except the flat screen haha) and you will not be disappointed.
1;I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.
3;I have been going to this hard to find place for years.  It was recommended by a friend from the frist moment I bit into the crispy crust I was hooked. \nI will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of Classic Italian is that I have introduced some other friends to this place and they went on to be hard, hard core regulars.  Dinning there a few times a week for about five years now.  \n\nThe pizza is European Style.  Individual pizza, thin crust with fresh toppings.  I especially love the fresh Prosucitto and basil pie. \nTheir Tomato salad is excellent and the bread sticks and mariana sauce is some of the best in town.  Love it!
2;So marquee...Look this review is from someone who loves, I mean loves hip hop and r&b. I do know my house, dubstep, techno shit too so dont get it twisted. This place is amazing if you like the later part. The venue is cool when it is not packed and fun with a group of friends. Don't get me wrong many people love this place, I just think there are other clubs with more room to dance in, yes I actually do dance, game recognize game. The hip hop room is ALWAYS crackin if you love hip hop. But more packed than tuna in a can and it is a sauna in there. Cliff notes: Go there if you haven't before, other than that move on.
4;"Mint Salon/ Dante really DOES deserve your business!!!!! I will not write novel,but tell you that Kelley, yes the owner, is wonderful. She is talented, energetic and truly cares about every customer. When I arrived there in Sept 2013, after a horrible haircut from another nameless salon. Kelley assured me that with careful cutting and time...my hair would recover.....my 1st cut was to correct all the previous errors, all the cuts that followed fine tuned an amazing haircut.....and my haircut today.....well let me say that had i skipped my cut, no one would have know....the perfect haircut....i NEVER have \""bad\"" hair days....... the staff is friendly and welcoming...the new flair and design of the salon is fresh and lively....I hope that Alison S will never come back...try Super Cuts!"
2;losing a star.  Since they've gone to 24/7 hours, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  They turn so many tables I don't think they care about service anymore.  Still the best spot for viet food in LV but viet food shouldn't be too expensive, it's comfort food from a 3rd world country!
2;Closest off the strip reasonably priced JewFood in the Northwest side of the valley. Matzo ball soup and Pastrami spell comfort food. Like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in. Great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry.
3;Viv B. is a fun boutique with a sophisticated but youthful aesthetic. I'm a real fan of their jewelry and art pieces, as well as their scent items, and though their clothing selection is small, it's very sharply curated. The owner named the shop after her grandmother, whose portrait presides over the shop like some kind of stylish saint.
0;Food might have been good, however they were out of rice, Guacamole, and oh ya, CARNE ASADA.
2;All this hype I heard about wicked spoon. Let me tell you, does not live up to the hype.  Prime rib felt like rubber.  Crab legs were cold.  Their version of ramen tasted undercooked and had the texture of playdoe.  I honestly think their sausage and dessert was the best thing there.  Would I go back? Probably not.
1;"We walked into this place to see not 1 but 2 hostesses just walking away from the hostess stand. It was several minutes before we were acknowledged despite the appearance of them being adequately staffed considering they weren't particularly busy. The chips and salsa arrived immediately -- salsa was good but chips were the greasy, stuck together variety. When I asked the waitress for recommendations (the menu is quite extensive) she replied, \""I don't really like mexican food but...\"". Against my better judgement I ordered the arroz con pollo per her recommendation. I ate some of it, it was \""fine\"", but I left about half on my plate and I NEVER leave food on my plate. It was also accompanied by steamed cabbage & other veggies which I found odd and have never experienced in a mexican restaurant before. \n\nI'm glad I tried it .. but am glad I didn't have to go out of my way to get there & I won't be going back"
3;We had them out to clean our carpets this past week and they did a great job. The carpeting hadnt been cleaned in about 1 1/2 yrs. so it was nice to have them turn out like new again. They were courteous,showed up on time and did the job in a reasonably fast amount of time. I am going to have them back to clean my grout too.I would recommend Carpet Monkeys to my friends.
0;"This place is the pits. Rude staff. Out of date website. No healthy menu options and everything is made from the same pre-packaged low-cost-options as every other Costco based pizza joint in Vegas.\n\nThe menu I found hanging from the no soliciting sign on my front door boldly proclaims antipasti and seafood options. The only \""antipasti\"" is a pathetic salad consisting of romaine lettuce, ham, salami, tomato and provolone. Where's the prosciutto?\n\nSeafood options are limited to re-heated bulk store offerings. After calling in my order, the manager taking my order had to put me on hold for several minutes just to answer my question about where the clams originated.\n\nThe website specifies delivery to North Las Vegas only, despite the restaurant being located in Centennial. Phoning back to address these issues directly with the manager on duty July 2, 2014, I was treated disrespectfully and hung up on. Very poor experience."
4;I recently took my vehicle in to Community Tire & Auto to have a coolant leak repaired.  While the coolant leak was fixed my vehicle started leaking oil in the same area the coolant leak was fixed, thus making it necessary to have the original work redone. The staff at the 32nd St location deserve a round of applause for the courtesy and professionalism they demonstrated from start to finish and for a job well done!  \n\noh.. forgot one last note.. I'll be back!
3;Had the Italian Stallion and it was great.  I liked this place better than Bianco in terms of pizza.  The salad was a bit bland though.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out!
3;tasty food and good size portions, homemade presentation and flavor.
1;First time here was a ok experience.  Tried the lunch buffet for $7.99 and kids are $3.99 drinks are extra.  Went straight to sushi bar and it was not special. We took all the spicy tuna and it took a long time before they made more.  There was no one at the sushi counter. A lot for snow birds type hardly any Asians other then workers. (You know what I mean)  They had the basic Chinese food stuff. What I like was the bacon wrap shrimp, orange chicken, sesame chicken and the spicy/ sour soup was actually good.  I will stick to my usual Asian buffet place..
4;The stone crabs were tasty but a lot of work to get meat even though they were cracked. The mustard sauce is like crack.. I wanted more! The ahi tuna steak was cooked perfectly rare. The wine and the service were unbelievable.\n\nIt's definitely a hefty price but everything was delicious and filling. The banana pie was delish!
3;We stayed at Palazzo over the holidays and decided to try out this place.  I had made reservations for 9pm but arrived about 20mins early and was seated right away.  Overall a decent experience.\nAmbience:  Dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  \nService:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too.\nFood:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert.\nValue:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.  \n\nAll in all, a decent date night place.  Just don't come expecting over the top sushi.
2;Good food good prices! It just too small. It's almost like I dread going in because I know I'm going to have a hard time finding a seat and waiting for people to get up.
4;Great Family owned place to get all of your BBQ supplies!
4;Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around
3;Excellent food at an affordable price.  If Mexican fast food is your scene, there are few rivals to Filiberto's.  In my former life as a fast food aficionado, I found myself daily at the drive-thru window of Fliberto's ordering breakfast burritos.  All varieties excellent!  Huge burritos overflowing with yummity goodness.  Nothing hits the spot like breakfast at Filiberto's.  Now that I have reformed my ways of eating to embrace a healthier lifestyle, I still find that there are yummity healthy options like the pollo asado burrito minus the tortilla.  The salsa verde is excellent.  You can switch your flour tortillas for corn tortillas and ask for grilled options.  I have shopped around and still think Filiberto's is one of a kind.  Eat well. Be well.
0;Arrived at the frontier check-in line 55 minutes prior to flight.  Their line is very inefficient and moves slowly.  We got to the front of the line with 40 minutes before our flight. The frontier employee told us they have a 45 minute policy and that we cannot take our direct flight that we paid for. There was no verbal announcement made about our flight. \n\nWe were charged a $75 service fee each ($150 total) to change our reservation due to their inefficient method of checking their customers in.  We also met two other customers on our same flight who had the same experience.\n\nIn the end, our indirect flight was delayed and we were traveling for 12 hours. We arrived to Ohare and our bags were missing. Took 2.5 days to both bags. We were on vacation. \n\nCalled customer service during normal business hours and was on hold for 1.5 hours. Business hours closed and no one answered the phone. I then called reservations and told a supervisor our experience. He did not have any sympathy. \n\nWe will not fly frontier again. Again.
3;This is going to be long, so bear with me.\n\nI've stayed here twice ...once in Nov 2008 and again in spring 2009.  Both times we arrived before the check in time and were checked in without a problem.  I booked a 2 bedroom suite for my boyfriend and two of our friends on our Nov 08.  The 2 bedroom suite was amazing! It's a 1 bedroom suite & deluxe suite next to each other.  Both require key entry, but the double doors in the foyer (with a door bell) close, allowing you to keep both of your doors open.  We went grocery shopping before we checked in. \n\nHousekeeping was quick and pleasant.  We needed door stops and had them within 15 minutes of our call.  Room service was quick as well, with our order in our room in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe 1 bedroom features a full kitchen, which saved us so much money on food and drinks!  We usually spent a couple hours after each night out unwinding with some snacks and a drink before heading to bed.  If you stay in a deluxe suite, avoid getting too many frozen items since you only get a mini fridge.  In fact, try to keep all frozen/refrigerated items to a minimum.  The wifi worked wonderfully both times we stayed.  I actually lost my phone in the casino the second time we stayed, so having the wifi came in handy in going online to notify my service provider.\n\nThe bedrooms are so nice.  The tv comes up out of the desk which is pretty cool, although we never actually watched the tv.  I did take advantage of the tv in the bathroom while I got ready.  The beds were super comfy, and everyone got a kick out of the plush white robes in the closets.  I went to sleep early one night while everyone stayed up in the front room, and I could hardly hear them.  In fact, we never heard anyone in any of the rooms around us either, even when we were in the hallways.  The only reason I knew people were on the same floor as us were their dirty dishes from room service in the hall.\n\nThe bathrooms are great! From the tvs, to the double sinks, to the soaking dub, separate shower, and enclose toilet.  It was all so nice.  Getting ready was never an issue, my boyfriend and I were out of each others way even when my girl friend came over and was getting ready in there with us.  The bathroom in the deluxe suite is just as nice.  A bit smaller, but much larger than your standard hotel bathroom.  It was still enough room for 2 people to get ready without bumping into each other.\n\nThe second time we stayed, we only stayed in a deluxe suite in early 2009.   I actually gave the wrong card and it got declined at check in, and the clerk discreetly wrote down the remaining balance due and quietly explained my card didn't work.  She stayed just as friendly and her demeanor never changed.  I've done this at other hotels *cough*Luxor*cough* and was given a bit of attitude and the decline was made obvious to others checking in around us.\n\nIf you're a smoker, be prepared to walk a ways to be able to smoke.  That being said, we would make our smoking trips few and far between, or wait until we got to the casino.  We would go to the front of the tower across the driveway where they had ashtrays.  Of course it feels like a long walk when you've been drinking, but I TOTALLY understand why they keep the smokers far from the entrance.  If I'm a nonsmoker and show up at a nonsmoking hotel, the last thing I want to smell is cigarette smoke.\n\nMy husband (was the boyfriend who went with me on both trips) and I are going tomorrow for our honeymoon.  We're staying 4 nights in a deluxe suite.  I'm interested in seeing what our stay is like this time around since it's been a while since we've stayed there, and I've read a few reviews stating the quality has dipped.  I'm going to let them know we're staying for our honeymoon and request a balcony, and see if they give us one, since I didn't want to spend the extra $20 to guarantee a balcony.  We used the stay 3 nights get the 4th night free offer, so I'm curious to see how that works out too.
0;Just AWFUL...  I was in town for a Bridal Shower and the service was horrible!!  There was only 12 of us women and they couldn't get it together.  They forgot to bring out 2 salads and missed 3 entrees.  Our waiter Kevin was the worst and the manager Kelly was non-responsive.  DO NOT ever plan a party here.  I felt bad for the bride.  The day was supposed to be about her, but everyone was focused on the slow, lousy, rude service
1;This place is getting 2/5 stars (40%) for several reasons:\n\nThe hostess told us that we would need to wait in a nonexistent line and then put up a divider to separate us from the restaurant, even though there were several empty tables.   I had a horrible hangover, so I felt like I was being barred from nourishment.  I began to wonder if I was going to die waiting in line for pho....\n\nI ordered chicken soup with glass noodles and my friend ordered standard pho.  She said hers was average.  Mine was too heavy on the MSG.  In my opinion, a restaurant shouldn't have to rely on MSG to make food taste good.  The glass noodles were cooked fine.  The chicken tasted pretty good on its own.  This did not cure my hangover at all, so I resorted to eating rice and cucumbers until I could lift my head again... I know it's kind of anal and stereotypically Asian of me to mention this, but the rice was cooked with way too much water.  Thank goodness for those cucumbers that saved my life.  \n\nWe felt good enough for dessert by the end of the meal, so we ordered the sorbet.  It took them over ten minutes to bring the sorbet out to us, and afterward they incorrectly charged our credit cards.  When I looked at my account the Monday after, I saw that they had charged me twice.  Not cool!  I'm already broke from Vegas as it is!  And the sorbet wasn't flavorful.  Don't get it if you are actually a sorbet person.\n\nSo to put it short, the service here sucks and the food is aiiiiiiight.
3;I love Cirque du Soleil and I was really excited to see Ka for the first time. The set is incredible, I don't know how they make the stage move like that but it's amazing. I have to say though, it looked like they put so much effort into the production and trying for first time to have a cohesive storyline that they took away some of the amazing human feats the other shows have so I was a little disappointed on that end. Still it is an amazing show and definitely worth checking out in Vegas.
3;"Dinner 8-4-12\n\nVisiting a friend in Champaign for the weekend--this was an above average experience. (probably closer to a 4.5 than a 4)\n\nTo start we had an order of Truffle fries-very good.\nI had Shrimp and Grits--it was fantastic!  Definitely 5 star--wouldn't change any part of it--though the portion was a bit huge.  My friend had the vegan dish on the menu and also really liked hers.\nI am deducting one start for the desserts.  My friend had a fruit pie that was just a bit strange and it was too tart.  I believe that rhubarb wasn't countered by a sweet enough berry.  And it was a tad dry.\nI had butterscotch pudding.  The pudding was good but it was topped with a ton of whipped cream.  The cream was clearly homemade so big thumbs up for quality but it tasted of bourbon.  I understand why, I am just not a fan of bourbon really.  My espresso martini that I paired with it was FANTASTIC though.  \n\nService was great--good recommendations on wine and very friendly.  We didn't feel like we \""waited\"" for anything.  I like the atmosphere of the place.   They put a real effort into their dishes and everything has a homey feel to it.  Would definitely visit this restaurant again."
0;Bad! Local produce? Try spoiled produce! Appalled by the lack of freshness! Vegetables were past their prime. We left hungry. So disapointed, we wanted to support a local business, but this was so bad! All the good reviews are lies!
1;We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \n\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.
4;This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  The fried green tomato BLT sandwich with pimento cheese is divine.  It goes great with the pomme frites and a trio of aioli sauces for dipping.  The calamari is also terrific.  It is lightly breaded and cooked to perfection with this amazing Asian Love Sauce.
4;Best collard greens I've ever had with BBQ to match. $3 pints of ANY BEER on Mondays. Super friendly wait staff. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.
3;I struggled with the decision of four of five stars ... I decided to go with four because while I LOVED the food here, it fell down in one or two places.\n\nI went here with my man this past summer, when is was so excruciatingly hot (remember that weekend?) that we spent most of our time laying around complaining, and drinking cold beer.  My guy went for a meal with one of his buddies here a couple of weeks prior and raved about it so much that I forced him to take me one evening when we were able to peel ourselves off the floor.\nHe reported that the beers were quite pricey so we opted for a bottle of white wine.  The white wine selection was pretty limited and not cheap (we ordered the cheapest bottle at something like \u00a315.00), and I regret to say that we were most assuredly not impressed with our choice.  \n\nOur food, however, more than made up for it.  I love tapas because I love variety.  We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.  I would love to go into detail but have a memory like a sieve and can't remember what we ordered off the top of my head.  I would be pretty confident, though, that anything you order here will be grat.    \n\nThe problem with Dionika is that no one ever goes here.  I honestly don't know how they survive.  I have NEVER seen it full.  It's one of those things where people don't go there because it's always empty, but of course it's always empty because no one goes there.  \n\nWe keep wanting to go back but walk by and it's so dead that we decide to go somewhere else.  I think maybe everyone who likes this place need to agree on a night to go there so we can have great food AND good atmosphere!\n\nOne other oddity - at the end of our meal the owner/chef came out and made his chatty round of the dining room (all three tables).  He was very spirited and certainly loves his restaurant.  He was a bit eccentric, but gave us complimentary booze so our hearts were won over.\n\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that the meal (including 15 pounds for a bottle of wine) was 40 pounds.  I thought it was a major bargain.
3;I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.
4;I am not sure if it is every location, or just this one, but the staff here is GREAT! Even when we stop in and don't see a friend of ours, the rest of the staff is very helpful and friendly, making suggestions that aren't just bigger sales, but honest suggestions.\n\nWe have been making a semi-frequent stop in lately, as we are getting ready for a race, the cashiers are sure to help a large number of customers each day, but they remembered us and had a genuine sense of enjoying their jobs.\n\nThe prices are competitive, for quality goods as well. Heading back when we need to pick something up.
2;I really wanted to love Trevi but now, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI reserved our seat via OpenTable.  It turned out that a reservation was unnecessary as the restaurant was basically empty when we arrived (albeit early). We were promptly seated by the fountain.\n\nI should say that service is fantastic! \n\nThe waiter provided a bucket of some kind of 'bread' which none of us liked but I was too hungry to argue. I'm a firm believer that you can judge a restaurant on it's bread. And Trevi was failing early on.\n\nMy wife ordered the salmon, my daughter ordered spaghetti (sauce on the side) and I Veal parm.\n\nI'll start with the great - My Veal was exceptional - nearly every time I've had Veal Parm at a restaurant it has been underwhelming at best and like cardboard at worst.  Trevi's was simply amazing.  They should make this a signature dish. Kudos to the Chef.\n\nOur daughter loved her spaghetti - however it came out wrong at first and had to be remade.\n\nMy wife's salmon was 'average'. It was cooked properly but lacked any flavor. And it was on a bed of black crunchy something. She fished all the salmon pieces she could off the plate and left everything else.\n\nDessert menu was passed around and surprisingly our daughter passed on it. If a seven year old passes on sugar, something is wrong with the options. So we asked for the check and left.\n\nWhat I discovered later is what left 'the bad taste in my mouth'. I received an email via OpenTable roughly 20minutes after we had been seated at Trevi stating that our reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant. I didn't notice it till I got back to the hotel later the same evening. I'll leave it up to you to decide why that might have happened.
1;I went for lunch here after they sent me an email with what seemed like an amazing lunchtime deal. And as much as it kills me to quote my mother, if something seems to good to be true then it usually is. That was definitely the case here. Don't get me wrong, it was nice. But 'nice' also applies to your friend's boring girlfriend, or the jumper your gran gives you at christmas and is desperate to hear your opinion of. \n\nFirst off, I think it's really cheeky when restaurants charge you for a basket of bread. Especially when there's only one slice each, it's not even that fresh and it costs \u00a33.50. For that price i could have bought myself a glass of wine, and i know which one of the two i'd have preferred!\n\nWe were ordering from the 'Du Vin Or Not Du Vin' menu, which gave us the choice of 2 courses for \u00a310 a head, or 2 courses with wine for \u00a315 a head. At first glance, it all sounded very tasty and exciting... but it was effectively just a list of your bang-average pub dishes described over 4 or 5 lines, with at least half of those words being in various foreign languages.\n\nMy boyfriend had steak and chips (which, incidentally, wasn't cooked the way he'd asked for it) and I had mussels and chips in a really bland cream sauce with some green bits in it, although if they were herbs I couldn't taste them... now you understand why they have to dress it up so much on the menu! In the ten days since we ate there, I've completely forgotten what we even had as a starter - read into that what you will.\n\nLong story short, I ended up paying almost \u00a350 for a meal that they make you think will cost \u00a330. More annoyingly, it was a meal that I could have got in pretty much any of the half dozen pubs within 20 metres of here, for a fraction of that price and with much better atmosphere. I don't mind paying a lot when it's actually worth it, but I just got the feeling here that they were trying to get money out of you at every available opportunity, with all their sly little extras.
3;The simple Flying Biscuit breakfast is a solid choice for a newcomer. Two fresh eggs and sausage patties, and not the overly seasoned or salty kind you find at Bojangles. The large biscuit with apple butter is good and flaky but not the best I've had. But the grits, oh the grits, are out of this world! They call them creamy dreamy grits, and that couldn't be any more accurate. Awesome, but prepare to pay $10 or more for breakfast. Everything on their menu could be a little cheaper in my opinion.
1;So, it had been a while since I had been, and remembered it being okay, so I thought I'd drive over and give it a hot. I ordered the tomato soup & turkey deluxe. The service, again, was very slow! The staff seemed pretty involved in their own conversations rather than working. So, I got home and my turkey deluxe, which should have been turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomato & bacon...no bacon, ugh! In addition there was one piece of turkey. I will say the chips & salsa, I guess the automatic side, were good. Definitely disappointed with my return visit :-(.
3;Dino's is definitely a dive bar but it's amazing because of it! The bar itself is by no means big in fact I think it could comfortably accommodate about 120 people and that is being generous. The bartenders are friendly and service is pretty prompt but when a rush comes in the drink service does slow down a bit and I don't think it's the bartenders fault more the size of the bar itself. The drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great! Did I mention they have karoake? If I didn't let me tell you, they have a great song selection and they make it fun! This bar is my new favorite and it's located downtown.
0;Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right.
4;Lauretta was very helpful in educating me on skin care and was a pleasure to be around. I would recommend her services to everyone in Scottsdale.
4;Yep, this place is legit.   I tried this on a whim after driving through the area, looking for something to eat.   I saw the positive reviews that other Yelpers had given and felt it was worth a shot.   I was not disappointed, I was actually quite impressed by the friendly service and the food was quite delicious.   Definitely try the pork, it is an absolute revelation, very tender and juicy with tremendous flavor, was certainly everything others have hyped it up to be.    Beyond that I tried a little of the pineapple chicken which was also quite tasty.    Overall, I'm going to be coming back here and soon, a very nice place run by a friendly couple who do make you feel right at home.   \n\n  Definitely give this place a visit if you're in the area.
3;went to smash-burger on sat night.  the food was really excellent if not a little messy.  i had the arizona smash and fries.  the fries were a great surprise ...lightly flavored with garlic and rosemary yummm.  and you got plenty to share (which i did).  i kept looking at the menu, it's limited but they seem to have everything i could have wanted and a burger joint.  i would go back till i tried it all.  we shall see.  check this place out.
3;If you're easily overwhelmed by stores like the Forever 21 and H&M located further down in the Southside Works, give Figleaf a shot!  You'll feel like someone personally sorted through all the junk at the megastores and left you with a color-coded selection of well-chosen clothing, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. The clothes are stylish and reasonably priced-- I picked up a cute maxi dress for summer for under $40!  Although the quality isn't really the best, it's great to pick up a few trendy seasonal pieces without breaking the bank.\n\nOne of the only downsides with a small boutique shop like Figleaf is that they frequently run out of popular sizes in their inventory.  If you want to have your pick from the sizes, you'll have to either take your chances and stop in a few times, or harass the sales girls until they tell you when the next shipment is coming in.  Also, make sure you're aware of the return policy, which is exchanges only...no refunds!
4;First place I wanted to go to for breakfast when arriving to Las Vegas was hash house a go go. This was my very first time at this place. I would say that this is one of my top favorite places! They serve big portions that could be enough for two ppl. Their food is delicious!! I love it even more because they give you a side of fruit which all breakfast Places should have. You gotta try it out for yourself, it's so worth it.
4;"Excellent food, and I really do mean excellent.  The service was fantastic, and when the waiter described the meatloaf as \""not your mother's meatloaf\"" I had to try it.  He also had stories and recommendations that would have made me order a plate of dirt, he was very convincing and passionate about the menu.  I also sampled the dishes that my other friends ordered (scallops, chicken) and those were excellent as well.\n\nOK, so now that I got that out of the way, WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE CORKAGE (OR LACK THEREOF) IN ARIZONA?!??!  We brought a bottle of wine, an expensive bottle, and as soon as we walked in they informed us that Arizona has only one or two restaurants that allow you to pay corkage and drink your own wine!  I thought Arizona was full of conservatives, and we all know conservatives love to drink so what's the deal?  \n\nWe were disappointed, we wanted to drink our delicious wine, and since we were there for spring training and the night was young, we carried around an unopened bottle of wine all night and had to explain at every single bar we entered what it was all about and had to also promise not to open the bottle in the bar, as if we would waste such a great wine on just getting drunk!  Annoying. I will not deduct a star from this wonderful restaurant because of the wine situation, but I will tell you that I am giving the WHOLE STATE OF ARIZONA only one star for their stupid corkage regulations."
2;Returned for another dinner with friends last night... \nWhile the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.\n\nI don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!
2;Decent outlet mall with mostly higher-end options. Location is under construction so some businesses are closed and parts of the parking lot are a bit of a disaster, recommend using the garage.\n\nDespite the brand-name stores (Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Ann Taylor, etc), the mall itself is on the run-down side and not in the best area of town, either. Expect to run into a lot of foreign shoppers who are nearly rabid and salivating over the sale prices, with no courtesy- cutting you off, snatching up things you're looking at, etc. If you don't want to deal with that, maybe go elsewhere.\n\nLots of sales here, being that it's an outlet but definitely make sure you're getting a good deal before buying- many of the locations have minimal markdowns, while others have 20 on top of 50% deals regularly. Just shop wisely and make sure to inspect condition of items before purchase, many places have small-print all-sales-final policies.
4;This is my local Chipotle, but they've always proven to be pretty consistent whenever I've ventured elsewhere. The ingredients are fresh, the service is usually good, and the prices are pretty fair for what you get. I usually go with three soft tacos so I can switch it up and get one chicken, one steak, and one barbacoa. Variety is good. I also can't resist their chips and medium salsa, something about that hint of lime and the salt they use just makes it too hard for me to say no. Admittedly, sometimes their food really does a number on my stomach, but it tastes so good that I usually just deal with the consequences later. It doesn't hurt that their is this absolutely gorgeous girl that works there too, which ensures that I make a trip at least once a week.
1;"AYCE sushi: The sushi is very good. Expect to wait for a long time for the food. The sushi menu isn't too diverse or different. Most sushi rolls are the same with 1 or 2 differences from another sushi roll that's on the menu. The ordering time is 45 mins for lunch. Order A LOT when they initially take your order. Also, keep track of what you order, chances are.. You will not get it.\n\nService: Not the best in the world. The staff are so so. I actually witnessed the staff argue with a customer about the wait time. \""Sorry, you have never waited for food? We are busy\""."
0;The kids wanted to watch Disney's Million Dollar Arm and Suncoast was the closest to home playing it.  It had been a while since visiting Suncoast, and the stench of cigarette smoke when you walk into the casino reminded me why we prefer Red Rock. \n\nI walk up to the cashier and ask for 2 adults and 3 kids for the 2:10 showing of Million Dollar Arm.  We walk in and the ticket taker tells us we're in theater 8.\n\nY'all should know that the children in our group were 5, 9, and 10 years old.  \n\nWe stop by concessions and load up with hotdogs, popcorn, drinks, candy...  $60 worth of junk!!  We could barely carry everything but we found our way to theater 8.  Something was playing which we figured were trailers.  We found a seat and sat down.  \n\nTo our horror, the characters on screen were cussing and making sexual motions.  The boys start giggling.  Wth?!?  Disney wouldn't show inappropriate trailers...would they?!?  \n\nI look down at the tickets and the lady sold me tickets to the 1:30 showing of Million Ways to Die - Rated R.  \n\nHow can you even sell children tickets to a rated R movie?!?  \n\nI was annoyed and mentioned to the assistant manager what had happened.  I wasn't asking for anything free.  I just thought they should know that they might be selling rated R movie tickets to minors.  \n\nThe asst manager giggles when I tell her what happened.  Really??  Then she offers to exchange the tickets.   I asked why?  I told her we would just walk into the right movie.  The theater was empty at 2pm.  As I left, the assistant manager was laughing with a co-worker about what had just happened.  Unbelievable.  \n\nThe ticket mixup was a nuisance.  The response from management was ridiculous.
4;Very clean and nice staff.  Probably one of the best locations they have.
2;I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\n\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience.
2;I've stayed at the Hyatt a few times in the past (always booked on Hotwire.com for a lot less than the normal rate). The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside (typical 60's stark & practical concrete look of Montreal's downtown) but the rooms are very nice. The bathrooms are stocked with fluffy towels and nice bath products and the bed is really comfortable.\n\nIf it was just for the room and the service at the front desk, this place would get a 4 or 4.5 star rating. But there were a few things that bothered me.\n\n1. Not sure who the genius was that decided to go with fabric curtains on the inside of the shower instead of plastic, but newsflash idiot, that cotton/silk blend ABSORBS water. What does that mean? It means that every time I take a shower, there's a giant puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Good thing there were plenty of extra towels every day to mop up the mess.\n\n2. The hotel is located in the Complex Desjardins and is above a mall so the lobby is actually located on the 6th floor. This means that from the street or garage, you have to take two sets of elevators to get to your room. Not so bad, but when the hotel is busy, you can wait a while for an elevator.\n\n3. I am constantly travelling for work or pleasure, which means lots of nights spent in hotels. One thing I've learned in my travels is that the higher the star rating, the nicer the bed/bedding and towels are but the more expensive WiFi costs. I've stayed at cheap rundown hotels that smelled like urine (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/days-inn-conference-center-york#hrid:pjiJL4H3qJIYBzwtcNrNOw) that had free WiFi. But the 4 star Hyatt Montreal charges $14/day for WiFi access. Really Hyatt? With the high cost for a room (standard room rate), you'd think you could include free WiFi.\n\nIt's not all bad though. The hotel is located right on Ste Catherine next to the newly renovated festival district. It's right at Place des Arts and a few minutes walk to the old Port or the debauchery that is Ste Catherine street.\n\nIn conclusion, use Hotwire.com to book a room in Montreal. You'll likely get the Hyatt for $85/night, which is worth it. \n\nFinaly note directed at hotels in general: Why do you supply fancy moisturizing cremes, which no one uses, but no toothpaste?
1;"\""Tourist trap\"" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more."
1;have tried the food here a few times (old location and current) and am just not impressed and it's clear that they have lot of Brookline locals doing their p.r. / promotions for them. People that don't get out of the yinzery confines of Brookline much, i'm guessing.  I see a couple praising reviews of it and I wish I could agree and wish i'd had whatever food they did but , shrug, just another old school / old-boy Pittsburgh Italian-ish eatery. (real Italian is better .)
0;I like Italian cuisine. I also like a good date night. This visit was so underwhelming that I will now rate the Olive Garden chain as fine Italian dining at its very, very best. We were here on a early weekday night with a very light crowd. Unfortunately, we did not order pizza. We had the restaurant.com certificate and thought we would try the pasta entrees. My date had shrimp fettuccine alfredo and I ordered a sort of baked ziti with sausage - the sausage was served separately!?! \n\nThe shrimp was in actuality salad shrimp. It looked like noodles with pieces of pink lucky charms in them with a taste of noodles with a nondescript presence of fish. The pasta with sausage tasted like it was just made, thawed out and served by the school cafeteria. It gave me the feeling that someone did scoop out something and plopped it on my plate as a carried the tray to the cashier. I should've had a bowl of tapioca or something on the side! The was one step better in that we were able to eat without someone yelling food fight! \n\nNice small place. You could pass it without seeing it in this area. No big signage. The toilet in the woman's room did not work properly. The restaurant.com certificate was blamed for a miscalculated bill. The pizza may be authentic but certainly not the pastas. My date and I are still together but this would be an ideal place to go if you wanted to break up.
0;The food is consistent with all other chipo's but the A/C is either not working or needs to be turned down!  It is always hot as @$&/ in there. Every time I ask the staff why and they have no explanation.  When I asked if other people have complained the said all the time.  It's Arizona...  Every restaurant should have a working hvac in AZ!!!
4;This place is astounding! The staff is always wonderful and they make you feel like one of the family. The food takes some time, so be patient. They make everything to order and everything is worth the wait. I have yet to have something there that I have not loved. When we want good homemade italian food, Montesano's is the only place for us! We've tried a few other places but they just don't compare to the awesomeness that is Montesano's. It's so amazing that we're going there again tonight!
3;I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.
4;Fantastic, gourmet pizza in an uber-hip atmosphere inside what used to be a federal bank. Love the idea of re-using a space rather than knocking it down. The wait was very long on a Friday night, so I would recommend going at another time. But it was still fantastic. OH, and get the blackberry rosemary wine cooler. You will not be disappointed.
3;"As many of the reviewers, I heard about Over Easy on Food Network's \""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\"" and decided I needed to check this place out. I unfortunately was not greeted by the jolly chef I saw on TV, but I was greeted by what I presume to be the same breakfast dishes he inspired. It was an interestingly unique atmosphere with good service and great food! It was very busy and did take us a little while to be seated but my girlfriend and I eventually found our way inside and had a good experience.\n\nKeep singing,\n\n-Jerron"
3;"From Daniel Boulud to ummmm, \""Lakeside'? Now that is a name that conjours up images of a restaurant perched at the edge of an artificial lake in 'any-burb' USA. Yikes! We almost didn't walk down the 'grand staircase'. But we did. So much for second guessing the quality of the food by the name of the restaurant. The food was great! We had: uber fresh, briny, sweet oysters on the half shell--YUM!, a generous serving of thin sliced Iberico ham (but not paper thin) served with arugula, small wedges of manchego cheese, green olives in olive oil and grilled ciabatta points, super soft grilled octopus served nestled on a tasty white bean salad with sherry vinegar and roasted garlic aioli, braised wagyu short ribs with gnocchi, parmesan cheese, roasted tomatoes, english peas, and flavorful wood fire grilled lemon garlic king prawns. The food was fresh and the flavors bold and forthright. No complaints about the food at all. The food was deeeelish! The 'show' in the 'magic pond' (aka the pond of dreams) was entertaining and great photo op amusing. Our waitperson, Douglas, was personable, polite and very accomodating when we asked to be moved indoors (the outdoor tables were too cold for us). So, the flaws with this reastaurant?...The outdoor patio is the place to be, however, the outdoor 'heaters' don't throw off enough heat to keep the outdoor patio diners warm and cozy. We had to ask to be moved indoors. Unfortunately the indoor tables lack the 'ambiance' of the outdoor tables. The lighting in the indoor dining area is bright and when combined with the modern dining room tables and the overall modern decor, feels jarringly harsh. The combination of the bright light and modern furniture gives the dining area a 'cafeteria' feel. So, to summarize, great food, junk name for the restaurant -- come on--you guys at Wynn can come up with a name more creative than \""Lakeside\""? and junk ambiance in the indoor dining area (too bright and not cozy)."
1;It is different. I don't know if they changed owners or cooks but it's just not as good. Maybe an off night. Had the shredded beef enchiladas and they barely put any chile, the corn tortillas were either over cooked or not fresh but hard and not from frying. I removed the tortillas and scooped out the beef - it wasn't tender but stringy and hard. I poured salsa from the salsa bar on it. I'm so bummed I really, really liked this place. They are still really busy so maybe an off night.\n\nI hate eating out and wasting money and calories on mediocre food.
4;I love Shakti. I can always find something wonderful. It might be a t-shirt or possibly a candle. Their jewelry is moderately priced and beautiful. If you need incense or a book you can find it here. I just like walking into the place. It gives you a really great, peaceful feeling.
1;"It's been a little while but I just called to confirm that they still use CANNED mushrooms! We liked the pizza but when you don't use fresh mushrooms, our favorite ingredient, then it kills the whole deal.\n\nStart using fresh ingredients and we'll be back!\n\nEDIT: My intention isn't to start a pissing match with the company but what you're stating is false. My wife and I ordered 1 of your pizzas and picked it up ourselves, it came with canned mushrooms, not fresh. I called to order again on the date of my original \""review\"" and the person on the phone stated that F.P. still uses canned mushrooms. Please take note I said that we liked the pizza and we'd be back if this changed and so far, according to YOUR employee, it has not. We'll place an order in the near future and see how that goes. I will be sure to update my review at that time."
2;Decent Japanese food. The menu has a lot of variety with even vegetarian options to satisfy a majority of people's food preferences. If you're a sushi connoisseur, stick with the other items on the menu. The salmon entree and the udon are solid meals that are tasty and filling.
2;I liked Pomo\nThe ambiance is nice but nothing special. Service, fast and friendly. Food, superb. The Tiramasu was the best I've ever tasted. \nOne small problem...the portions are ridiculously small.\nIf Claim Jumper is at one extreme with its Fred Flintstone sized portions, then this place is the polar opposite.\nAs I said, if its quality youre looking for, or, if youre one of those little tiny Scottsdale model types, you'll be right at home here. \nUnfortunately, I'm not a small person and portions this small and expensive only send me into the waiting (and loving) arms of my fridge.\n\nThanks Pomo, but until you find a new location in a lower rent, higher populated area that doesnt cater to winter visitors, I wont be coming back. \nYou would have done nicely in Scottsdale Quarter where you could have filled your tables nightly and reduced your cost structure. \nToo bad Grimaldi's beat you to that punch or I would have been a weekly visitor.
3;Having a neighborhood go-to breakfast/deli is a must and I think this place just be some my go-to.\n\nI have lived in this city for 9 months now and cannot believe it took that long to discover this gem. Owens is tucked away inside the pavilion in south end with somewhat limited parking options. \n\nThe inside is very casually. Writing, scribbles, graffiti, hieroglyphics, and artwork adorns the walls along with stickers, college pendants, and signs with what I imagine to be regular customer's special orders.\n\nThe bagels are all fresh daily and the steam the sandwiches. I highly recommend the bialy. They are small but unique, flavorful and delicious.\n\nThe menu is humongous...overwhelming really. In addition to that, their are individually created variations mounted above the deli counter. It's usually busy and I always find myself rushing to figure out what I want. My first visit I was hurried into ordering and settled on the Mary's grubby bubbly. It was on the small size because of the bagel, but superb.\n\nOn the second visit I had a custom creation of sprouts, bacon, mayo, provolone, lettuce, and avocado on an everything bagel and was equally impressed.\n\nI am so incredibly excited to have found this place and am sure I will be back very soon!
0;Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions
3;Great show, but had great seats. I feel sorry for those in the balcony, as some of the magic is close-up....but this is a common problem with theater magic....to be expected. In fact, they do a whole routine about the intimacy of close-up magic that is projected on a big screen for those in the back of the audience, and the diversions created by the cameraman. That illusion was so excellent and to-the-point. Spoiler alert, spoiler alert ... how Teller became the audience member-videographer was amazing.\n\nPenn was his usual heavy-handed preachy and political...no wonder Teller is speechless...can't get a word in. But he's an atheist libertarian, and would expect nothing less from him.\n\nThe comedic aspects of the show are genuinely funny and at times unexpected, making them even better moments.\n\nIf you're gong to a magic show to be spellbound and tricked, this show's not for you. Although they have several cool tricks they don't explain, they do walk you through the process of being a huckster magician and psychic. No wonder other magicians hate them.\n\nAvoid the bar at the show, unless you like $16-20 drinks, $8 sodas, $6 water. Unless your an alcoholic, you can wait the 90mins to get your fix cheaper.\n\nDon't miss the meet and great after the show, especially with Teller. He'll actually chat with you...he speaks...and take a selfie with you. He takes the picture, and is a good photographer.\n\nThe show is a well produced Las Vegas show. Buy the closest tix you can afford, or get discounted vouchers on the Strip, show-up early at 7pm and ask for an upgrade...worked for me. Got 7th row seats for $62. Would highly recommend, and quasi-kid friendly. They do swear, but no more than kids hear on the playground.
0;The douchy wanna-be Scottsdale type waiter took forever to get to our table. He's all grins to the cute girls at our table and won't acknowledge any guy. I could see one of the managers sitting at the bar drinking. Probably off her shift, but she's there in her spare time?  Seen other of their staff hanging out drinking too.  Maybe it's just me, but it feels awkward to be around that.  It also probably explains why their service sucks, because their employees treat the place as their personal hang out instead of their place of work.  Also, the music was loud and spazzy. I appreciate a good mash-up too, but this stuff was just painful and obnoxious. \n\nMy guess is that the only reason this place gets business is because it's the only game in town for the Chandler/Ahwatukee area. I don't know too many people that actually enjoy going here, but it's probably the lesser of two evils (instead of driving to Scottsdale). PLEASE let there be more competition for a good bar/nightclub in this area!
1;I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.
1;This was my second time here. My first experience was great but this time around, not so much.I asked the waiter what is the difference between Al Ajillo and Al Mojo de Ajo, he answered that it is the same thing, that it was just a misprint on the menu. He said its just garlic salt, pepper and a little spice. So I ordered a steak with shrimp al mojo de Ajo but when i received the plate it was covered in a wine sauce. A wine sauce that was supposed to be reduced but instead was watery.The waiter never even mentioned it had wine and there was so much it ruined the meat, rice, etc. My husband let the waiter know of our disappointment but we never received an apology from him. We did receive great service from other staff members but that isn't enough to make me go back to this restaurant. People do seem to enjoy the atmosphere here but I prefer to enjoy my food and this place couldn't do that for me.
1;DISAPPOINTED!!!!  I went here at 8:00 on a thursday night.  I ordered the turkey, avocado and bacon on focaccia , a cannoli, parmesan chips and water.  First of all, they were out of focaccia, so I had it on a baguette.  Then, when i got to the window, she told me they were out of cannoli so she offered me a mousse dome.  Then she came back and said they were out of that.  So I got a brownie.  \nThe chips were stale.  Like they had been sitting out all day.  There was NO bacon on my sandwich, and the bread was tough tough tough. \n I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe try once more, but for the price, it was definitely not worth it.\nOne more thing...it is October 9, they were completely decorated for...CHRISTMAS!
4;They always have tasty food! Great stop before a long travel day! The brownies and cookies! I love this Amex perk!!!
2;"I've had good & bad experiences here, but thought I'd review my most recent visit on Sunday.  I find it very confusing that you are greeted by one server, then someone else brings you the beverages, then another person introduces themself as your main server & then when you need refills, doesn't know what you ordered since they didn't take your drink order & then someone else brings your food. I never leave hungry there; however, this time & ordered the half rack of ribs & received 5 ribs with hardly any meat on them.  The taste was great, but I expected a bit more meat.  Also, it's time to introduce a real kid menu. I counted at least 15 other tables with kids, yet their kid's hamburger & a beverage was $9.00.  That's just ridiculous!  The server was also extremely slow. I never have to ask for beverage refills but did this time.  Also, we knew when she dropped the check that we wouldn't see her again for ages, so we handed her the credit card immediately hoping she would get a clue that we wanted to leave. She wasn't too bright, as we waited another 10 minutes for her to come back.  I would rate this visit 1 star; however, this isn't the norm, so I give 3."
1;I was looking for another wonderful all-you-can-eat sushi experience in Montreal and thought I'd try this restaurant.  The atmosphere is very nice and service was fast to get seated and I loved the fact that they give you a Samsung Tablet to order your food whenever you want, it was quite fun.  \nThe fun, however, seemed to stop there.  The menu is quite full and some pictures looked really nice.  I ordered a grilled salmon and when received, it was a salmon belly (almost 80 percent fat) with the bone in it.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that this is the correct order and that I can eat the fat and skin which I refused.  She said that if I wanted a lean cut then I would need to order the Teriyaki Salmon.\nOk, ordered the new salmon and some more sushi and a gingered beef.  The server came in with her thumb in the sauce, really, right in the sauce of the ginger beef and happily left me with the dish.   Well, it costs a dollar to send food back and there was no plant close by to put the food in so I ate the part that was not in the sauce.\n\nThe sushi rolls are nice, the tempura was delicious but then I saw something on the menu that I just had to try, the Crab.  The description showed that it was crab meat in a light tempura.  I received the dish, well, maybe crab in Montreal is different from the Maritimes but we don't consider fake crab  meat made from arctic char as being crab.  \n\nI did have a very nice discussion with a lady at another table about the place, she said never come alone and order their full dishes with noodles, they are very delicious.  Well, unfortunately I cannot make myself go back.  There is a different all you can eat sushi spot I tried (not Kanda) which was at least a 4 star place.   I will not be returning.
2;Had lunch there today. Good food, however the girl at the register could have been much friendlier. Much improvement needed at the register. Again food was good.
3;I wanted to try this when I was here last year, but I had to wait a year.  Like many similar spots throughout the different casinos this is a frozen drink and bottled beer stand that serves blended slush like drinks in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.  This one is located just outside of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino's Street of Dreams next to the Starbucks at the foot of the escalators leading visitors to the Aria/Crystals/Bellagio free tram.  The location is in a bad spot hidden from view from visitors exiting the Street of Dreams shops.  There is bar seating and small round tables nearby as the Monte Carlo website depicts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=HWH4uputadH926t3vAqz6A).\n\nMy friends walked over to Starbucks for some after-dinner coffee, but since I don't drink coffee I decided to have an alcoholic slushie instead.  Of the eight or so blended concoctions I went with the 16 ounce Blue Ice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=w-MIlrBEGwq3Sh1GUL7g9g) made with SKYY Citron Vodka partly because I'm attracted to blue colored drinks like blue Gatorade, blue PowerAde, Blue Raspberry Slurpees from 7-11 or blue cream soda.  The vodka taste stood out quite well and with the exception of a few spells of brain freeze I enjoyed the drink very much.\n\nThe flavor was neither too sweet nor too tart.  It was a very good smurfy blue after-dinner refresher.  The $8 price for a 16 ounce serving was exactly the same as all the other similar frozen alcohol blender stands we saw at other casinos along the Strip.  Jello shots are also available but not every night.
4;One of our favorite restaurants!\n\nWe love the Caprese Salad, the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella are wonderful to start the meal with.\n\nI love the Diavola (spicy and so tasty), Capricciosa (savory with the veggies) pizzas, and the Misto (shaved meats, cheeses, olives, marinated zucchini and focaccia), could only be improved would be to added a few grapes and some sliced tart apple.\n\nHusband's favorites are the Settebello and the Margherita w/ Calabrese and mushrooms pizzas.\n\nIt can be a bit busy and crowded but the staff tries to keep everything moving along as quick as they can.  Its not really a restaurant for kids but people seem to want to bring them here anyway. :-S
3;It always tickles me to find a little slice of heaven in my own back yard. Barrelhouse is it.\n\nHidden in a strip mall, once you're inside, the hip, almost industrial vibe sets the mood for a laid back evening of eclectic cuisine, drinks so delish you'd think they had a chemist behind the bar and a respite from from a formulaic chain or an over priced indy restaurant .\n\nI've been there twice. First time, service was a little shaky, but they communicated with us abut the situation and we had an amazing dinner. Plenty of time to talk and catch up with friends, while enjoying cocktails and appetizers prior to the  entrees. I knew they were having an off night---they were more upset about it than we were. Food was amazing.\n\nLast night, we gave them another shot. Service--- five stars. Amazing. Food is nothing less than marvelous. I had Caribbean Jerk  Spiced Sea Bass and it's the best I have ever had. My best friend had pot roast---simmered for 8 hours and while I would never order pot roast at a restaurant, I would order this!! (Your grandmother has nothing on pot roast compared to this.) \n\nI could go on and on about the menu, but check it out for yourself. It's unlike any menu I've seen----from grass fed beef hamburgers to truffle mac n cheese. \n\nYou can make reservations too.  \n\n Enjoy a little find in the east valley!
0;If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of.  And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass.  Wtf!?  This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus?  Will not be coming back.  Get it together .
3;Common Market has soooo many great reasons to visit! It's a great place to:\n\n-Take friends visiting the city (it's a community staple)\n-Have a cool brew\n-Get a delicious sandwich (haven't had a bad one yet...although the last time I went they forgot to add bacon to my sandwich so double check your order before leaving)\n-Write your next blog post...or is that just me:)\n\nThe staff is easy like Sunday morning. Come to chill and be sure to stop by when they have tastings and live music (ck out their site for details). It's totally worth it and with the oh-so-not-common atmosphere, you'll always something new to try!
2;Second visit.  Service still so-so, but the server did do me a favor when I wanted something light for dinner.  I added shrimp to the brussel sprouts salad.  Toe-wiggling yummy!  \n\nPlace was not as clean as my last visit, there was something smeary and crummy on the table and when I told our server, she ran a damp cloth over, sending crumbs into our laps.  Ick!  \n\nBut for the Roasted Brussel Sprout and Beet salad (now with addition of shrimp), I'll be back.  But maybe I'll try take-away next time.
1;So you have a fascination with steampunk? And you feel like having some bar food for dinner? Well then, it would be a huge mistake to come here. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nWe arrived to find an almost empty restaurant at 9 PM on a friday night - a telltale sign - but I was excited to check out this steampunk-themed restaurant that I long to visit. I noticed that the place has a few gear motifs here and there and a few really cool and exotic sculptures. Besides that, it was just an open space with tables and chairs. Already, I felt disappointed. \n\nBut the real disappointment came when our food arrived. There were four of us and we ordered the bacon wrapped bacon and egg, oxtail sticks, chicken pot pie nuggets, cheese charcuterie, mac n cheese and potato fries. Our whole party liked the oxtail and the bacon wrapped bacon n egg but we could not get over the fact that these mediocre items were costing us almost 5 times the costs if we were to get these items elsewhere. \n\nI don't feel right paying $9 for a bucket of fries that tasted exactly like fries at McDonalds. Or paying $14 for a tiny bowl of mediocre mac n cheese. \n\nIf only their drinks were better to make up for the terrible eating experience but that would be asking too much of the Rx Boiler Room, as I ordered the Some like it hot cocktail and was terribly disappointed at this drink as well. \n\nStay away, unless you just don't care about the price - or the food -  and just want to come in to look at the cool sculptures.
0;Dave is an amazing person who will do well at whatever he does, but I am afraid he stood us up this morning and when we contacted him to find out where he was, he told my husband that he is really no longer in the sprinkler business.  This makes me very, very sad! I loved him and I adored working with him.
1;"Pretty much done with Nello's Ahwatukee...it is now The Parlor - Part II wannabe\n\nThey have killed what used to be really good pizza - NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE there can make a pizza like George used to.\n\nWhat a shame and a perfectly good wood-burning pizza oven being sadly misused.\n\nFlorencia is much better; even Grimaldi's is better - and carryout from Rosati's is WAY better!"
4;What an awesome experience to add to our Vegas getaway!  We had decided fairly last minute to try our hand at the trapeze, and Stefan was able to accommodate us.  We took a cab from the strip (about 15 minutes) into the residential area.  While the location was a little random, we had read that it was in an odd spot, and had no impact on our time there.  \n\nWe arrived and Stefan, Justin, and April were awesome to work with.  We felt completely safe and knowledgeable every step of the way--all the way through completing a catch on the high trapeze.  It was an extremely fun, active way to spend an evening.  Well worth your money!  Thanks for a fabulous night!
1;My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. \nCheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg
0;Sloooow service. Basically they seat you and forget about you. I watched it happen to everyone who came in. Food wasn't very good, either.
2;Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon, they had 4 other tables.  The place is clean and service was ok.  I had the egg rolls, bun with bbq pork, and soy milk.  The egg rolls were crispy but I did not like the insides.  It was missing the meat portion for the extra taste.  The bun with bbq pork was ok too.  The noodles were very cold (normally it should be room temp.) and the pork slices were so thin.  I have not found a GREAT PHO place yet on the West side.
3;FINALLY got to try the highly praised Bacchanal Buffet inside the Caesar's Palace.\nI gotta say that I was quite impressed with the wide selection and excellent quality of the food. Did I eat $60 worth of buffet grub? I'm not so sure. To be honest, my experience here could have been better. I felt like a marathoner that couldn't finish the race. \n\nI literally started off with a sprint. I ran to the first station of food that I could lust my eyes upon which was the carving station. I got 2 legs of lamb, 2 bbq pork ribs, prime rib, and a truffle potato gratin. It filled up two plates, and I devoured it. The meats were a little salty, but I really enjoyed the truffle potato. Unfortunately, I could start to feel the effects of starting off too quickly. Next, I went on to the seafood station which included jumbo sized cocktail shrimp, mussels, snow crab legs, and raw oysters. The seafood was a little salty as well which resulted in a lot of water consumption. Then, I went on to try their dim sum and sushi. The spicy salmon sashimi was fresh and very tasty. Finally, the reason why I feel like I couldn't finish the race was because I was too stuffed to really enjoy the seductive looking desserts. They had macarons, all different kinds of cake, ice cream, and even Mochi freakin ice cream! Sadly, my stomach only had room for a black sesame and green tea Mochi ice cream :(\n\nGotta come in with a better strategy next time!
2;Average show worth the price of free if you can get them. Juggler comedian was the highlight.
3;"When in Vegas,\n\n1) buy a delicious \""adult slurpee\"" in a delicious flavor right outside the Imperial Palace\n2) bring said special, yard-long beverage into the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club\n3) sing or mock karaoke\n4) enjoy!\n5) your pre-game is complete... time to go out!"
1;Target has a promotion they call Holly Jolly Savings.  It is promoted as spend $50 on Holiday items and get $10 off at the register. Sounds easy enough!  I fill my shopping cart with holiday Items and get to the check out..  My total was $171.80.  I showed the cashier my coupon, she scanned it  and told me my purchases did not qualify.  Really?,.....I ask how much more do I need to spend to qualify?  She does not have a clue but suggested I inquire at the customer service desk.  I go to the customer service desk and the clerk also has no clue to how the promotion works, but he was somehow sure I did not qualify.  I told him I would no longer be shopping at Target and he smiled and wished me a good day.  Officially added Target to my do not shop there anymore list along with Sears and Kmart..  I added a star as they have incredible shopping carts.
4;"This is far and away the finest hotel on Fremont. It has old school charm and a \""classic Vegas\"" feel (less like the new Disneyland hotels). If you stay downtown this is THE place to be. It's also close to dozens of other fun destinations.\n\nAmazing pool with a waterfall, shark tank, and hundreds of lounge chairs, really nice rooms, great bars, a nightclub, excellent food, clean casino, and a great value.\n\nPost renovation I would put the Nugget in a class with most strip hotels."
0;"My goodness Yelpers. You have disappointed me!! You've given this place 2 stars! Obviously, you've thought way too FONDLY of this hell hole. LOL!\n\nI just wrote a review for Delmonico, which is a fine establishment. And now, I will write about the most horrendous establishment that is Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. \n\nFirst of all, it's located in the Forum Shops at Caear's Palace, home of my favorite stores - Louis, Gucci & Tiffany. But now I find that it's home of the WORST and overpriced \""restaurant\"" I've ever eaten at!\n\nPerhaps I, like other Yelpers, can be gracious and give this place 2 stars, only because the service wasn't horrible. The food, atmosphere and presentation are another story!\n\nI ordered a Strawberry Margarita. It took something like forever and a day for it to come to the table. It was surprising, since I don't remember taking Margarita mix and ice, putting it in a blender and pouring it in a glass could take so long!!! Perhaps it was my lapse in judgment to think that I could get anything close to a decent margarita at this joint. \n\nFor lunch, I ordered some kind of chicken sandwich with avocado and a side of fries. All that was on my plate was the chicken sandwich and a little cup of fries. That's it. Not even a little bit of garnish. Even Dave & Buster's puts your crappy food on a jazzy plate. \n\nThe worst part was the TVs must've been in control of a 13-year-old. Nothing but Disney kids (High School Musical) music videos on screen. \n\nOne bet is for sure - I'll never come back here again."
2;Seeking fried goodness and cheap beer? Belly on up to Vinnie's. And maybe bring some stretchy pants. \n\nI've been to Vinnie's a few times and I'm always intrigued by their super cheap brew specials (as Michael E. points out). This is a great little spot to grab a beer and some grub and watch the game. The waitresses here are always friendly and sport teeny little tanks - which I'm sure is a big hit with the guys. \n\nI'm really happy that smoking is outlawed indoors, as this place used to be almost unbearable in the evenings. No one likes to have a big side of smoke with their shrimp po' boy. And by the way, although a ton of their menu is fried (and well made), they do offer a great crab leg special on Monday nights that I am just itching to try. \n\nPer hubs, this is an amazing place to score oysters, too! \n\nNow...which Monday am I going to plant myself for unlimited crab legs...?
3;"Went to check this place out on a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is very large, comfortable, and well designed. Nice visual effects with TV projected to opaque film sandwiched between glass panels. (This makes it so that people on either side of the panel can watch the TV images.)\n\nThe staff was SUPER friendly and helpful. We brought a group of 11 and had run of the entire restaurant. (We got there pretty late, around 10PM) The owner took photos with us and even gave us some free appetizers.\n\nAnyway, the food was very good and quite reasonably priced. I got something called \""Beauty Course 3\"" which includes some of the best spicy squid I've ever had. It was spicy enough to be hot, but still flavorful and enjoyable. (Light sheen of sweat on my forehead told me it was good!) Be warned though, I'm Korean and can handle my spicy so your mileage may vary.\n\nI liked it a lot and will definitely go back."
3;Richard Pro here with another review.\n\nThis is a pretty solid joint for korean food. We got the $50 meal where you grill your own pork loin, galbi, and one other kind of beef. \n\nFirst off, you get a lot of meat, and unlimited refills on side dishes. I eat a lot, as you may know, so this place definitely deserves a Richard Pro size stamp of approval.\n\nThe side dishes are tasty. Potato salad (korean version?), broccoli, some sort of sweet potato, and various side dishes. We refilled most of them 3 times. The broccoli is my favorite because of some sort of special sauce they put on it. \n\nYour meal also comes with steamed egg and a bowl of spicy tofu soup. \n\nBright, cozy, and the booths are nice. 4 stars.
2;Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
0;This USED TO be a great cleaners. I brought in 3 pairs of pants for dry cleaning and a shirt to be laundered a few days ago. All of the pants had been previously pressed with a crease so I expected that I would get them back the same way. All 3 pairs were pressed flat with no crease, and the pressing was not very good either. I had to re-iron the pants at home and put the crease in myself. The body of the shirt looked great but the sleeves were not pressed. All in all, a disappointing experience and a waste of my money.
0;Still no communication from TOCA, they obviously do not care about their customers. Oh that's right, we are not customers, we are patients. I was corrected by their staff. Thanks for pointing that out!
0;Cox is the worst company we deal with on a monthly basis. They're the only cable internet company in the valley and they know it. Read all the other reviews and our story is the same. Their customer service is deplorable. This is the worst review I've ever given and I don't easily become negative toward companies. I'm a realist but they've had several chances.
0;If I could have rated NO STARS I would have.  When we walked in the hostess' are cleaning the menus and rolling napkins(didnt think this was the appropiate place for that).  Asked for a kids menu, they couldnt find them, said would look some more and bring it to the table.  She never came back, had to ask our server, she said she was looking for it. Mean while shes hugging her friends when they come in the door, almost groping lol.  So she walks by I say , hows that kids menu coming? Oh we ran out.  We get out apps, onion rings and irish nachos.  Cold stale fries onion rings barely warm.  I dont send food back because I heard what they do on comebacks at some places.  Get our food, wife had corned beef and cabbage, the cabbage was spoiled , absolutely tasted so bad.  I had shephards pie, came out luke warm, not very good at all. Mother had a cheeseburger. Came out well done and cold. I bought a groupon for this place and wanted my 25 bucks that spend on that back. The hostess sucked the waitress sucked the food sucked. The manager ended up taking care of our bill. But I still had to pay 25 bucks for shiite ! Stay away from this place.
0;My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds.
3;It's a everywhere and it's nothing unique but it's mostly fresh and they have mostly healthy options for mostly reasonable prices.\n\nThe half/half combos available for all their soups, salads, and sandwiches make this place a constant lunchtime stop for me.  The Fontana grilled cheese.  The tortellini  Alfredo pasta.  The Cesar.  All classics and all done fairly well here.\n\nThe negative: the sweeping.  Nearly every time I've been here someone has come by my table and started sweeping the carpet with a brush broom... Over and over and over.  Besides the dust that I'm sure it's putting into the air (and my food) it also makes a whole lot of noise and takes away from the meal.\n\nCertainly not a completely unique adventure.  But fairly solid food for a quick eat place.
1;My son and I went in tonight for dinner. Worst service ever. The first two girls pushed us along, my son was trying to ask her a question she just blew him off. He is eight years old. Not like he is a toddler running amuck. He order a kids # 4 which is a build your own tacos. We under stand that it only came with two sides. When he asked if he could have some lettuce she told him NO. That it would be an extra charge for for that. Are you kidding me for lettuce on a kids taco. I couldn't believe it. Especially after I just paid 2.00 for a skimpy side of guacamole for his taco. something restaurants should make a point of to their employees is that customers only go out maybe once a month or twice now, not like 5 years ago when it was 3 times so when it comes to making a choice where to go before they leave the house they think hmm..well last time I went there this or that happened, something as simple as they didn't even say goodbye or thank us as we were leaving and we tipped. Just some lettuce for thought chipotle.
2;"The restaurant is a nice-looking, with a pretty well-furnished and clean, if a bit crowded, set-up. This is probably what I liked best about the place. The food is reasonably good too, although maybe a little on the oily, chewy side; the cold cuts are really good, the soup was questionable, and the duck was so-so. \nI'm very particular about the house tea, and they had great tea here, so plus points for that!\n\nThe service is lukewarm at best. I didn't feel very comfortable as a guest here, since I like to have even just a bit of interaction with the servers, at the very least a greeting...\n\nMy family seems to like it, so I'll probably be back again to see if my discomfort goes away, but only when I get dragged over after a visit to 168, probably."
1;Came here because we had a gift certificate from an online deal- very hard to find tucked back between two buildings in the corner of the shopping center. The staff members are rude to eachother and loud so you can hear them even when they're back in the kitchen- really kills atmosphere. Sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before we were greeted (waitress did apologize for leaving us sitting there so long).  I liked the edamame, miso soup & tempura were pretty good, but the main course (beef teriyaki & sushi) were average at best which is not saying much for a sushi place. Restaraunt was dirty inside, thick layers of dust on almost anything you looked at- all light fixtures, booths, walls, wood trim... makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is if they don't clean the places you _do_ actually see. Highlight was our waitress, very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet & genuine, if not for her, this probably would've been a 1 star.
1;I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.
1;"45 minutes d attente, au lieu des 20 annoncees, pour \u00eatre en terrasse, la salle \u00e9tant vraiment trop bruyante, \u00e7a.commencait mal... \""Les meilleures pizzas de Montr\u00e9al\"", bon, ca valait surement le coup d attendre. Et bien non... La pizza du chef n'avait aucun interet tout comme les pates d un de mes amis, noy\u00e9s dans une sauce grasse insipide... une addition elevee m'a convaincu de me mettre que deux \u00e9toiles, le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tant la terrasse, agr\u00e9able. Bref, une adresse \u00e0 \u00e9viter, pour qui aime un tant soit peu la cuisine italienne!"
4;What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to.
3;"So happy that they decided to open up a Komex on my side of town!! Always a good place to go to for a quick bite. I also come here when I wanna introduce this place to people from out of town or if they've never been here before. I come here strictly for the fusion tacos. The spicy pork tacos are my favorite. Delicious!!! I have tried some of the other items on the menu on the other hand. They're alright.. nothing too \""fusiony\"" or special I would say"
0;This place has really declined in quality and selection of food.  It's no better than the $8 ghetto Chinese restaurants you find in the rough neighborhoods.\n\nThe food seemed to be left overs from lunch and the sushi was far from fresh. The desserts were sugar cookies, sams club sheet cake and ice cream.  It's not worth the money.
4;Came in on a lazy Sunday. Very slow day, but they work fast and efficiently. Took my nephew to get a cut and he requested a faux hawk. And the woman that did it(forgot her name, sorry! :[   ) and she did a great job. He looked so handsome. The salon is definitely kept clean which is also a plus. And the ladies that were working were very sweet. Will be back for sure.
4;I can't believe i haven't reviewed this show.  This was my first ever Vegas show because what can you really do in Vegas being 19 or 20 without a fake id.  \n\nI had an interest in cirque du soleil shows previously (watching it on tv) but after seeing this show i fell in LOVE with cirque du soleil productions.  \n\nI had the best seats ever courtesy of my friends dad's gaming habits :o)  It was dead center and only a few rows up from the stage.  This show was phenomenal.  The acrobatic sequences kept me on the edge of my seat.  The platform that the whole show was performed on was amazingly built.  This is a must see show and money well spent!!!
0;"I'm not one to judge pub food, because I don't eat it often. However, I am more than displeased with the food I ate at Burgundy Lion. I lie crouched in my bed right now suffering from a stomach ache, which was not there before I ate at B.L. It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint. Overall, this place is overrated and overpriced! Go at your own risk!"
2;My hubby says 2 1/2 stars and it was only for the ambiance, not the food. I think I have to agree! I've been to his steakhouse and was happy with my food there, so I was expecting some good food, especially with all the reviews. Sadly I have been excited to try this spot for a long time and I finally did. It was very packed for a week night, around 6 p.m. When we left, there was actually a long line forming. Upon first entering, I was really impressed by the fire lining the window as part of the decoration. The hostesses were standing around, greeted us, and took us right to our table. I was surprised how busy it was in there. There are huge TV screens covering the walls (sports bar-ish but with high price tags), loud music (Vegas all the way), and Gordon's pic all over the place, on the menu, on the wall, everywhere. At first I was very impressed with the whole thing. \n\nWhen we sat down our waitress Tammy came over and appeared to be a in a big rush. I ordered the Farm Burger, Hog Burger (love the name), and we got Maui Onion Rings and Truffle Fries. The burgers we got were supposed to be their speciality, so I was really expecting something special. Ummm the Hog Burger was not memorable at all. I can't say I enjoyed it one bit and almost felt like I was just eating it because it was so darn expensive!! ($17 with being a rewards member). The burger wasn't even that big and it just barely had any taste. The toppings were arugula and some sort of sauce, again nothing memorable. The Farm Burger had a nice piece of bacon on it, cheese, and an egg (doesn't sound original but in comparison to the Hog burger, it was decent). I really don't feel like with the high price here for the burgers, these burgers were worth the price. I hate to say it, but the burger was borderline dry. The Maui onion rings and garlic dipping sauce was tasty, but nothing that would bring me back to this restaurant just for that. The truffle fries were thick cut fries and had an overwhelming truffle taste, almost to the point where you felt gross eating such oily fries. \n\nI am glad I went and tried it and now my curiosity is over and I will not be back. With the Ipad menu, Iphone for giving feedback/review along with the check, and all the TV's, I think the high price of the food was going towards the gadgets instead of good quality food.
0;Pinks, i expected more from you! \nI stood in lines 2 hours for you in LA and thought you were a little better than average. Then i come to Las Vegas to try you again with barley any lines, and you were not great to me at all! I am totally breaking up with you. \n\nI tried the spicy dog and chilli cheese fries. Both were okay and had nothing special about them. This place is small, expensive for what you get, and seating is only outside. This place is truly overrated.
1;I'm shocked at the high reviews for this place. Did I have a one-off terrible experience? Went here in December with my father and husband for a celebratory dinner. Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later). \n\nOur 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.\n\nThe other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.\n\nMy husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.\n\nOverall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special. I hope for the sake of other diners my experience is not typical, but it was enough to burn this frequent Vegas traveler. I will not be back.
2;I used to go to this place when it was located in Green Valley a few years ago...It's too far from me now so I have not gone to this new location. However, when it was my B-Day (Sister's too) I decided I wanted a Guava cake from them. My sister picked it up...\nShe said she did not like that it was near a Pet Store but decided to look past that (you can't help who rents the space near you!!!).\nThe owner was nice and gave my sister a few Long Johns (custard filled long donuts) to try - she said it was very good. A person who walked in told my sister that he has the best cream puffs....\nThe cake was yummy-I wish the chiffon cake was guava and not just the Guava filling with white chiffon cake, other than that it was very good and the owners were very nice. I would go on a regular basis if their location was closer...
1;The restaurant has a nice appearance but the food was disappointing.\n\nWe got what looked like a heaping amount of guacamole, but in the middle of it they put chips (hidden to the eye until you get there) which made for soggy chips and less guac.  The guac was actually pretty good but that was disappointing.\n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich for lunch.  The portions were tiny and there was absolutely no presentation.  For $15 dollars at lunch I expect more food and more presentation than I got.\n\nThe drinks here are expensive too.  I think they are all about $12 each.  We went for the pitcher of Mojito's and while it was good, it was hard to get the mojito out from all of the ice, etc.\n\nI would not eat here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.
1;"Sorry, but I'm pretty disappointed with this place\n. I  expect competent staff for the exorbitant prices charged for the food and alcohol. What good is an extensive selection of highly-appraised food and alcohol on an iPad when the staff has little interest or focus to manage it. Sitting at the bar or at a table, the service sucked. I  get it that people make mistakes, but come on if I  wanted a third rate experience I  sure as hell wouldn't come to the Las Vegas Strip, and of the most expensive hotels on the Las Vegas Strip to find it. This is a pathetic example of everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas union economy today. Shameful.\n\nComment from Ryan L. regarding this review: \""You're an idiot, straighten up.\"" and \""Stop with the immature reviews.\"" Congratulations, Ryan L., welcome to your fifteen minutes of fame.  As for me, I call it like I see it. Your approval is not needed."
1;One of the worse dunkin donuts around.  They never get an order right...I mean really how hard is it to make a bagel with butter!  When you get the food on the second try it tastes ok.  But the service is horrible....either the local high school kids working the counter while hanging out with their friends or you get miserable servers who can't say hello or thank you.  If you want a really good donut fix go to fresh donuts about a half mile down the road on the other side of the street by the frys.
4;Everyone here is wonderful.  Make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or Lenscrafters.  The doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth.  I drive 45 minutes to go here.
3;Considering it's located at the Hard Rock Hotel, the atmosphere was not as loud as the floor and the lighting was perfect with a modern decor.\n\nNow to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended I try their specialty dishes. Which I did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o, to the black cod miso. Now I did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the Chef's sashimi which was ehh. Next time I will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. What made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, I ended up going with the Vanilla Tapioca. Sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely return and try their Beef Wagyu Beef or other signature dishes. Note this is not a cheap dinner by any stretch and expect to spend at least 150 per person but well worth it for the atmosphere and the experience.
1;My only thought about Taco Guild is that is it not worth it.  I love tacos, so it's safe to  say I was looking forward to trying this place.  Now I'd like to make it clear that my star total is strictly for the food.  The service, the decor and the ambiance are wonderful.  This place is beautiful and everyone was super friendly.  I will go back just because the experience was awesome, but I won't be the one suggesting it, because of the food.  The food was alright, but not outstanding.  I do like the options.  They have a duck taco and a lamb taco.  So that's fun.  However, the tacos were small.  For $4-$5 a taco, two should fill me up.  And you don't get a free side unless you buy 3 tacos, otherwise they run about $2.50.  I had a side of rice which probably wouldn't have filled up my hand.  I get that they are quality local ingredients, but I feel like the markup is a little ridiculous.  If you have a large appetite and a small budget, I DO NOT recommend Taco Guild.  Being that we live in Arizona, there are MANY other taco options around.  If you do go, go for the building.  It is really lovely.
2;I only use this location for smog checks twice a year and a car wash every couple months.  I always use a coupon for the smog check and I've always been in and out very quickly.  The car wash really is a get what you pay for scenario.  It can be hit or miss but the basic car wash is only $13 with a coupon so it's a fair price.  This last weekend I went was actually one of the better washes and interior vacuums I have received.  Too bad they didn't ring up my coupon but I did call and the manager said they would adjust the price next time.   I don't think I've ever seen the popcorn machine on at this location which would I wouldn't mind munching on while waiting.
3;I was skepticaly of this idea. But my friend wanted to go for her birthday..\n\nPRETTY FREAKN GOOD!\n\ni'd go back...not much else to say. definitely get custard in your shaved ice thing..I don't even know what to call it still.. I liked the fruity and creaminess
3;Vietnamese food made by (lovely!) Vietnamese family. They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.\n\nEstablished in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \n\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall.
3;Creative, fresh, tasty & here to stay!\nI have had many items on the menu, breakfast and lunch, enjoyed it all.
4;One of my favorite omlettes of all time. Solid cup of coffee, good ambiance, and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store. Great breakfast place, be sure to stop in!
0;"The owner is the only one with any talent and you need to catch her on a good day. I went to this place a total of 5 times. I got 1 good haircut from the owner and the next two that she did were nowhere near as good.  I even had to fix an obviously too long piece that did not fit with the rest of my bangs. I switched to another girl who did a not great job the first time and I went back thinking she just needed to get to know my hair. HA! The second time she not only slaughtered the haircut but really did a terrible color. Number one lesson girls, don't cut a person's hair too short on top if it's fine, especially fine and curly.  I did complain especially about the color and she put a glosser on it that made the \""caramel\"" (read brassy yellow) highlights look less like a peroxide bottle exploded in my direction, for a few shampoos, but eventually it faded back to that horrible color job and seriously dried out my hair. \n I haven't been back to this place in a while but I still remember how ugly I felt for months and months after that last horrible cut and color.  I saw that I had never posted this review from a while back so I went ahead and posted it now. It deserves to be posted when I still feel like crying just reading my old draft of a review. \n This place is seriously not worth $200+  The skill of the hairdressers is on par with a JC Penney salon- new hire!"
0;So here's latest.  I received a message from the BBB this evening stating that they were unsuccessful at getting a response from Filibertos.  Not sure what the next step is, but I am not finished.
2;Good food decent service but not amazing like Texas roadhouse.  The ribs are probably the best thing I have ever had here and they do give you amazing rolls before the meal.  I would recommend giving this place a try.
1;Stopped by for some Nachos that I have been craving for a while and I had a few hours to burn in the airport.  Price was not bad compared to the other places in the C terminal.  Popeyes chicken was 10 bucks for a three piece meal so I my pulled pork nachos weren't that far off.  I ordered them and they came pretty quick.  The order was huge, with two types of salsa on the side.  If I ordered meatless Nachos I would say this is a 3 star meal, but the nachos came with about 2 tablespoons of pork.  I literally had to search my plate at first for any signs of meat.  Also, might be coincidence, but within 15 minutes of finishing and paying for meal I had to make an emergency run to the restroom.  One time shot, but it certainly did not agree with me.  Next time might try Popeyes!
0;The whole service was awful! We got seated and it took about 15 min to get our drinks ordered, then they had the dishwasher, chef, waiters and the manager all taking orders. When the food was delivered about 30 min later one of our orders was wrong and the other was burnt also the table next to us had the same issue. And in the end when we went to pay they didn't have change so they asked myself if I had change for a dollar and when I said no the poor waitress had to use her own tips to give out change to the customers! Never again will I go there
0;Garcia's earns 1 star  because there was one person at the table who enjoyed the meal. Garcia's is definitely not gluten free friendly inspite of the so-called gluten free menu which I can almost recall by heart it is so short. Chicken Gasedo  (shredded chicken in soup bowl one of my tablemates called chicken slop) Beef Machaco, see chicken description, Veggies, Salsa, Black beans or charro beans, house salad with vinegar and oil. So for $9.99 I got a bowl of chicken slop and a cup of black beans. I thought when I got the bill I would be charged ala carte for both items but I wasn't. So don't know if the waiter didn't charge me or what. Word to the wise at Garcia's, add some corn tortillas, maybe keep a bag of tostitos in the kitchen.
2;friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.
0;We were excited to find a well-reviewed Chinese Restaurant close to home but were disappointed after eating the food.  My 13-month old daughter and I had an upset stomach that night and my dad got sick when he ate it for leftovers.  Needless to say, we will not return.
1;Stayed at the Luxor on our last day in Vegas. After staying in The Hotel at Mandalay Bay we were forced to stay in Vegas an extra day so we just walked over and bokked a room at the Luxor.\n\nWhen one first walks it is pretty cool to see the the hotel was constructed. Egyptian theme, hotel shaped like a pyramid. Very cool! Problem is that it all goes down hill from here. After checking in we were sent to our room which was in the new towers  which felt like a mile away from the check in desk.  Once in the room I was let down. Terrible bed, and the room was pretty basic  and badly decorated overall. We woke up to the sounds of constuction at 10 am. The constant drilling forced us to leave our room.  The service was terrible. Every employee seemed unhappy. I visited the business center as I had a to work for a couple of hours and cleary heard four employees openly complaing about there job and how badly staff is treated. \n\nUnhappy employees, bad service, so-so casino and an average dumpy room doesnt motivate me to ever want to come back.\n\nThe only thing I would recomend at the Luxor is their brunch buffet.
0;One of the worst nail places that I've been too. I went in to get a simple gel take off since I was too lazy to do it myself. They soaked fingers in some pink solution... It literally dyed my nails, cuticles and finger tips PINK!! It wouldn't wash off for days! She broke two of my natural grown nails in the process. I was especially pissed at that because it too me forever to grow them! The lady also rushed my take off... But for what? I'm the only one in there! Will never be coming back. Service and customer service was HORRIBLE.
1;So 2 stars is a little on the generous side. I was so surprised at the quality and taste of the food after reading the reviews. I feel like yelp let me down this time. I got the chicken and the egg biscuit and the biscuit might as well have been a hockey puck. You're in the south and that's like the one thing that should have been right!! No light flaky fluffy biscuit from a bread company?!?? The chicken was okay but nothing great and the cackalacky cheerwine sauce (sp?) was spicy (a good thing) but sooo overly salty and then sickeningly sweet on top of that. Just did not like it at all. My boyfriend got an omelette and well it was ridiculously over cooked. When it arrived it was brown... Basically I'll probably never eat here again.
0;I hate this place.  Why is ok to degrade Buddhist statues but never say a word about the virgin mary.  I am offended at the cultural appropriation and not to mention their billboards make me sick.  I love sex and I love love Vegas, but keep my religion out of it!\n\nThe food also is not that good, nor the cocktails.  If you are from CA, try the Geisha House in Hollywood.  It is amuch classier version.
3;Whiskey Dicks is in a bad location, but it isn't a bad pub at all!  The service is great, the beer is pretty good, and the food is pretty good too.  \n\nWe were greeting by a friendly short shorts wearing gal at the door, and were promptly seated.  I ordered a Ranger IPA, which is pretty good for a tap choice if you ask me.  They have a decent range of beers for an everyday bar.  I had the philly cheese with mesquite seasoned fries.  The fries were great!  The seasoning was awesome.  The philly wasn't the best, but it was good.  I thought the steak was a little dry, and there was too much bread on the thing.  The onions and peppers were nice and fresh though.  \n\nOverall, with the beer selection and the friendly service, I decided to bump WD up a star.  Most pubs aren't carrying any decent beer, and yes there are a few better pubs for good beer, but there are actually drinkable craft beers here. They carry a few New Belgian beers, along with Sam Adams seasonal beers.  since I work so close, I definitely plan on returning!
0;If I could give zero stars I would.\n\nI went in yesterday to get a battery... I am not sure how the guy up front even found the time to ring me up. He behaved like he had never been so put out.\n\nAfter paying nearly $200 for the battery he asked if I wanted someone to carry it out to the truck for me.\n\nI had already told him that I had to be jumped just to get there, but I nicely told him again and asked if someone could please help me change it out..  After a ridiculous audible sigh he stated that he would now have to ring me up to take the old battery.. \nA min later he says- Oh, I just remembered... I lent the tools to a customer working on his car outside... so you can either take it home or you can wait..\n\nI just took the battery and left, and managed to have it done at home..\n\nI will never visit that store again, I have never been treated so rudely...
3;"I had family in town during restaurant week and my mom suggested we try Malabar because the menu for restaurant week provided a lot of choices. \nEverything we ate was delicious. In particular the croquetas and gambas al ajillo from the tapas menu were bigger than I expected. \nFor entrees our party of 4 tried 3 of the 5 offerings: Suquet de Mariscos, Albondigas con arroz, Mixed grill. Everything was delicious. The rice almost out-shined the albondigas. Definitely inspired me to return to try their paella. \nDesserts were good- light but sweet- however, definitely not as memorable as the tapas and platos. \nMusic was not too loud and well-selected, playing one of my favorites from Barcelona, who had just been to CLT recently, Jarabe de Palo. \nBeer selection also included a little taste of Catalu\u00f1a including the more difficult to find in the States, Estrella Damm. \nTo sum up, the food and drinks (including an affordable wine selection by glass) would definitely bring me back for a second try. \nMy only negative, which may speak more to restaurant week than to Malabar, was that I did feel rushed. There definitely wasn't \""sobremesa\"" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so. At one point the waitress tried to take my plate with my pan con tomate (which we ordered extra off the regular menu and was worth it) even before I was finished and my sangria glass when I still had some left in my glass. Not huge criticisms, but for me, one of the best parts of Spanish eating- besides the flavors- is the sharing and relaxing over delicious food without worry for time or pace. \nOverall it was a great meal."
2;"Nah, I've had better.  Came here for lunch and the \""revolving\"" was not revolving. Instead, we were given a menu of what's available, from appetizers to sushi to udon, ramen, fried rice, dessert.  It was still all \""you can eat\"" for $11.95.  We ordered from the appetizers, lots of fried, breaded items, it was great for the kids who were with us.  We got sushi, it was nice and fresh.  We got udon to share and it was okay, not enough noodles.   Green tea ice cream was the best part!  Fried bananas were over breaded.  Service was slow, they had one souz chef making sushi, appetizers took a long time and server forgot our orders, she barely spoke English.  May not come back, maybe for the green tea ice cream only..."
3;of all the empanadas i tried (i got the after 10pm 6 for $9 deal), the only one that really didn't work for me was the pizza pepperoni one.  Pepperoni is meant to be eaten as garnish, not as a main ingredient.\n\nAnd yes, i ate all 6 in one sitting -- partly because i hadn't eaten all day and because my hotel room didn't have a microwave.
4;I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  \n\nThe fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  \n\nThey have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!\n\nEnjoy
3;We are lucky to have Pure as our closest option for Sushi.  We have been several times and i'm sure we will go many more.  \n\nWe have tried many different items and have never been disappointed.  We can recommend any of the specialty rolls, but love the Vegas, Dragon and Lobster rolls.  They also have a number of cooked dinner options for those who don't like raw and we have tried a few of them with good results.\n\nThe decor has a modern theme and pretty cool.  They also have a misted or heated patio (depending on the time of year) that is a nice option as well.\n\nStaff has always been friendly and helpful.\n\nMy one complaint is that it is priced on the high side, which when it is your local place makes it more difficult to go as often as we would like.
4;"C-Fu, Great Wall, Golden Buddha ... blah blah blah.\n\nFor those that know the difference, China King is still the go to place for Dim Sum and authentic Chinese Food in the Valley of the Sun. Just stopped in today on a random Tuesday for Dim Sum, small offerings off the carts but they made whatever I wanted fresh from the kitchen. (Turnip Cake, Chinese Broccoli & Sesame Seed Bun)\n\nAn interesting observation was that from 11am till 12;30PM I was the only white boy in the restaurant. 50% Chinese clients & 50% other ethic races.  WTF, I live more than 20 miles away an I make the pilgrimage every chance I get. Where TF are all the other locals eating lunch everyday. \n\nIf you live in the Chandler area, put the F'ing burgers down and get your white asses over here an experience real Chinese Food.\n\nOh yea I forgot to mention, China King is offering 15% off you total bill on the lunch menu until the Chinese New Years (Jan 31). Chinese Tea is free, total bill for 2 people was $17. \n\nNow you TAWB's (Tight Ass White Boys) have no excuse to give this place a try."
3;Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again.
1;I ordered decorated jumbo cupcakes for a small birthday dinner party.  One of the four cupcakes was to have Happy Birthday Grandma written on it.  The cupcake had a plain white plastic circle with the happy birthday grandma written in black marker.  Wow, I'm beyond disappointed.  Tacky, sigh... too late to get something else personalized.\n\nafter dinner party .....\nthe white circle was fondant not plastic...still did not like how it looked\nThe cupcakes were delicious though.
2;I was just an out of towner, passing through.  The market was worth a look but wasn't as big or bustling or locally-oriented as I had hoped.   \n\nThe cheese shop inside was the only booth that caught my attention for any period of time.  Cheeses from all over NC and beyond, samples provided.  They also had other goodies - we picked up a nice salami and some Brooklyn Bloody Mary mix that you can't typically find.\n\nHopefully this place will grow and thrive.  Go!  Buy something!
3;My family and I have eaten here for years, as it is close to our house.  Restaurant has a nice local following, and many of their diners are Take Out diners.  Their menu is limited but the items served is hot, fresh and flavorful.  My husband loves their sushi.\n\nWhen you arrive, you are immediately greeted and seated.  Be sure to check the specials listed on the chalk board near the entrance.  I like the decor, and facility, dining plates, utensils and glasses are clean.\n\nStaff is efficient and accommodating.  The menu is concise but has enough available for almost anyone.  Prices are reasonable and portions are above average.  Definitely will return.
1;The lobster mac and cheese was terrible. I also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea. Won't come back for anything else. Located inside the Planet Hollywood.
4;"Words cannot express the warm welcome and friendly nature of this business.  I had the opportunity of working with \""K\"" who was knowledgable and courteous.  I had dropped my iPhone in water, and he was able to fix the phone to take it from inoperable to working flawlessly.  You are insane to go ANYWHERE else.  Great price, great people, great service.  I wish I could give it a 10/10.\n\n5/5\n\n-Doug"
3;Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 29/100\n\nPanera has become a regular a Mother-Daughter hangout spot over the past year even if it's a little out of our way. \n\nThere's just something intimate about eating at a cute sandwich place with Mommy. It brings about good conversations and sets a good mood for the rest of the day. Like always, we choose the 'you pick two' option but frequently switch up our pairing. Yesterday, I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini (chopped basil, chipotle sauce, red onions and chicken fillet on foccacia bread) with cheddar broccoli soup (my favorite) while mommy ordered the Turkey Breast Sandwich with French Onion Soup. On top of it, we shared a couple packets of chips to go with the meal.\n\nService was very fast despite a large crowd. Our orders arrived on our tables within 3-5 minutes of waiting. They provide their diners with an electronic table locator which helps staff navigate their way through the restaurant, finding customers who change seats. Water cups are free with ample supply of lemon slices and shaded outdoor seating is available for the warm spring months. There's jazz music playing in the background and blinds lowered for when the sun is high up during the afternoon hours. \n\nI don't remember a Panera experience where I didn't enjoy. Props also to the staff for being so patient with me and my bestie about a month back when we stayed for 3 hours or so making origami boxes for her sister-in-law. We are definitely coming back here more often in the near future.
0;Yikes,  the memories of DQ.  You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.\n\n2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.\n\n3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???\n\n4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!\n\n5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.\n\nThis is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence.
3;Always passed this place, and finally today stopped in for a burrito. I got the AL Pastor pork burrito. It was a little heavy on the refried beans, but overall was a very nice burrito. I'll come back again and try other things.
3;"+1 star for not waiting in line\n+1 star for being a girl and not paying a cover\n+1 star for getting a bracelet for free champagne all night\n+1 star for having enough space to dance my ass off\n\nThings I learned while in Vegas: There are definitely reasons why champagne is offered as the \""unlimited drink.\"" You can only drink so much of it. Props to myself for letting an \""old man,\"" who I thought was 35, but according to my friends definitely was not, buy me enough drinks to make me think he was 35. Go me."
1;You get what you pay for. Police where called to the room next to me. The rooms had a nice modern touch to them overall was a nice look however I did get bit by a bug while I was there.... Not cute.
2;"So, I really like steak.  I regularly patronize Outback for the affordable, tasty meat they never fail to produce.  This first encounter with Texas Roadhouse yielded the following opinions:\n\nTexas Roadhouse is the American Cowboy version of the Aussie Outback.  Lots of similarities.\nOutback is, however, more flavorful.\nThe sweet potato has more sugar, but is somehow less sweet.  Still tasty though!\nI could do without the prime rib in the future.\n\nWe were seated very quickly, despite the busy night.  It was almost too quickly... half our party was on the way to the table while the other was still trying to get through the front door.  Service was pleasant but brief, also due to the busy night.  There were several birthdays in the house, as evidenced by the echoing \""YeeHaw!\""s every so often.  Our small party ordered very similar meals to what we're accustomed to at Outback, and that was probably a mistake.  I shouldn't have put Outback expectations on Texas.  The salad was a perfectly fine side salad, the veggies looked standard, and the mashed potatoes had good flavor.  I enjoyed my sweet potato topped with toasted marshmallows, and felt only a little guilty about it.  The prime rib however tasted like ham.  I don't actually like ham, nor did I order it, so I wasn't pleased with the taste in my beef.  I think it was slightly overcooked from my requested medium-rare, but it was tender enough I wasn't too upset.  \n\nI would return to Texas Roadhouse if I was in the area, and I'd order sirloin.  But only after Yelping to make sure there are no Outbacks in the vicinity."
1;"I go to this CVS pretty often because of how close it is to where I live and because it's got overall pretty decent prices when it comes to beer and champagne and what have ya.  I'm not sure where their prices stand on their hard liquor but usually anything outside of a liquor store is pretty outrageous.\n\nAlso, if I have the beer munchies, I can get a frozen pizza.  Hooray!\n\nI have a serious issue with this place in the morning, man.  Sometimes on my way to work, I like to stop here, buy a bottle of water and a Red Bull but sitting out in back, where I like to lock up my bike, are these intensely aggressive tweekers/bums.  If I have money or change, I give it to the homeless when I can.  These guys, though.  I won't do it.  I won't give these guys shit.  One time I was locking up my bike and this chick who looked like she'd been eating meth for breakfast since she was knee-high to a grasshopper whistled at me and stared at me with these cold, dead eyes.  Around the corner, this guy appeared, all gangly and filthy.  Then they start demanding I give them money.... not asking, demanding.\n\nFuck that noise, Jack.  I took off.\n\nSo, this morning I come by and there they are, sittin' there.  I shit you not these guys are about as close to being zombies as you can get.  Not exaggerating:  I rode by and the chick reached out and said, \""You got money?\""\n\nI circled around to the front entrance, locked up my bike and the front door had a sign that said to go in through the back.  Through the back?  Where those stinky, demanding tweekers can accost me?  \n\nIf there's a quiet bum sitting out in front, whatever, a little trashy but what's a bum to do?  Two or three tweekers that say, \""Gimme money,\"" and whistle at you?  Chase 'em off with a broom!"
2;not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place
0;Their donuts might be amazing, but I'll never know. Not only is this place annoying to get to - it's inside of a car wash and there's no parking - it's NEVER open. I've tried twice now because it's so close to my house, but it's been a total waste of time both trips.
0;We stayed here over the Presidents Day weekend. This place is a complete dump!! We arrived at 3am and finally got to our room at 5am after a 2 hour wait to check-in. They first gave us the wrong room that was already occupied, then had to go back down to get a new room. Parking was horrible, had to end up parking at Harrahs. The rooms are filthy. The carpet has stains, and the furniture is tore up. The whole room smells bad. It was so bad, that by 7:30 that same morning we left to go stay in another hotel. But that is not all. I never thought that I would ever see a Caesars Entertainment Property have duct tape holding down the seams of the carpet in the hallway. Wow!!! I contacted the hotel once I got home, and below is their reply:\n\nDear Mr. XXXXXX,\n\nThank you for contacting The Quad and making us aware of your experience. Your comments are appreciated as it enables us to identify what we are doing correctly to satisfy our guests, as well as, discovering where adjustments can be made so we may continue providing the best products and service.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I certainly understand your frustrations. We all set expectations before we travel and certainly the type of room that we will receive is one of those. I was disappointed to hear we were unable to meet your expectations with the room you received during your visit and apologize for any inconvenience. As a mature hotel, it is challenging to keep our product fresh and up to our brand standards, however, there is absolutely no excuse for you not to receive a room that affords you the comforts of home.

Please be assured that our main goal at The Quad is to provide the finest in accommodations, products, and service to you, our valued guests.

Your business is truly appreciated and we hope you will give us another chance to serve you again in the near future.\n\nI hope you have a good day, \n\nReally??? Epic Fail!!! Do not waste your time or money on this one!!
2;Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places
0;Very slow service.  Been here 30+ minutes and my car still hasn't come thru the wash part yet.  No one seems to know why things are taking so long.
2;This place is your typical Italian restaurant with good food and an only ok dining area. The tables and chairs could use replacing and the decor is outdated. The service was a bit slow but not horrible. The food was average and they prices were a little high. I have also ordered in their pizza and it came quick but for the cost, it was not what I expected. I have been to better Italian places in town so this place will only be one I go back to because it is close to my house.
3;My husband and I loved this place!  The atmosphere was a bit gaudy, yes but our waitress was cute as a button and extremely polite.  We came after Happy Hour, but she showed us menus for happy hour and told us about the blues/jazz and belly dancers for future.  \n\nWe ordered humms, large greek salad and shrimp souvlaki.  Honestly, everything was fantastic.  Our pita was warm.  Our waitress was very attentive.  We ordered 2 lemonades that came in long, super tall glasses. It seemed fresh squeezed.  We did go a little late, there were about 4 other tables outside and they had the fire pit going.  We wil be back.
2;A friend recommended this place. \n\nAfter landing it was our first stop and can't really complain too much. One star for the food (nothing too special or out of the ordinary) and two starts the the location. In fact, the best part of Diablo's is the location. We sat on the patio looking over the strip and had the best people watching. SIT ON THE PATIO!
4;Five stars for the NEW Soul Cafe which has taken the place of the Harvest Restaurant. \n\nYou want great pancakes? Go to this cafe. You want a great dinner? Guess where to go. \nFine dining, excellent food quality, delicious meals, great service and very good value for the dollar spent. \n\nThis and the owner's other restaurant in Cave Creek are our favorites and I would strongly recommend anyone go here for not only a delicious breakfast, dinner and lunch but for the money you will spend, it cannot be beat!!
0;I hate to say this, but I have eaten meals at Applebee's that were better than the two times I have been here.  We went yesterday and while I do enjoy the atmosphere, that is about it.  The first time we went a few months ago, we thought it was just okay too, but not bad enough to post a review, but also not good enough either.  The items we have tried thus far:\nFireball whiskey wings - not spicy at all, but i did like the lollipop style presentation.\nCarne asada tacos - no flavor to the meat at all.  Salsa bland as well.\nBBQ burger -  WAY better and much cheaper at Bobby's Burger Palace.\nBig Dipper roast beef sandwich - NO FLAVOR AT ALL!  No horseradish taste and the au jus tasted like canned beef broth.  Also, horribly tough meat that tasted faintly like smoke and the bread hardened up immediately as if microwaved.\n\nBoth the above had an assortment of different fries tossed together that would have been good had they not tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.\n\nNow mind you, nothing at all between the meats and the fries on both visits tasted like they had been hit with any seasoning at all. I am very surprised at the bland fast food quality for the prices they charge.  Guy always seems to be about flavor and nothing has it!!  I am a local and love his shows, which is why I gave him a second chance to begin with.  The restaurant seems to be about style only, not food and not service.\n\nNow, add to the fact that we had a snarky wannabe comedian for a waiter, who only came back to see if we wanted another drink after my husband was already done! Will not be back!!
2;I came here on Saturday on a second hand store rummage day out with my husband and I just have to say that I don't get it, Savers.  \n\nI. Don't. Get. It.\n\nFirst let me start by pointing out something that you guys may have forgotten, you are a secondhand store, not a resale store for gently used merchandise or even a consignment shop.  There *is* a difference.  Your stuff is no nicer than a standard Goodwill's stuff, yet you think you can command about twice the price for your stuff??   Uh, no.\n\nYeah, it's clean and organized in comparison to a Goodwill, but it still smells like my grandma's closet, or maybe even my musty garage after a humid day.  Why?  Because it's STILL a secondhand store, full of unwashed goods, of questionable provenance, from other people.\n\nI found a wall mounted coat rack that I really liked and would have purchased, but it was $10.   Uh, sorry, but that isn't that awesome of a deal.  And my husband found some well loved, North Face snow pants that would have been a good deal for something slightly less than the $25 they wanted for them, AND if they hadn't also been ripped at the bottom so I would have had to mend them anyway...  c'mon Savers, really?\n\nAdding to all this is the fact that they weren't even offering any kind of point of sale discount, coupons, nothing...  At least Goodwill was running a 50% off everything deal that same day.  I did hear an overhead announcement that said that if you register online with Savers and give them your email address they'll send you coupons, but who really wants Spam from a secondhand store?  I certainly don't.  I much prefer a point of sale discount that requires no sharing of my personal contact information, thankyouverymuch.\n\nSaver's whether you guys like it or not, Goodwill IS your competition, so you better step up your game to actually compete with them.  I'll be clear, I'm not cheap and I'd like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the secondhand stores across the Valley (hell, I was raised shopping in secondhand stores) but I refuse to pay those kinds of prices for that kind of merchandise.  \n\nYou guys need to reexamine your pricing structure because it kinda sucks.
0;Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!
2;Hey all! Well this place is definitely not the ritz. However, when my flight got cancelled and I was not sure what to do when I had to stay the night, this place was cheap and affordable! Though it is an older hotel and it is noticeable it is clean. The food downstairs is still great wings like hooters always has! In addition, tables are cheaper (which is nice) than the other spots. It is not on the strip though around the corner from the strip. And being across from the MGM and next to Tropicana you can just walk through them to get to the strip too. \n\nThe hotel is also quiet compared to most others including others that are off the strip.  It also has free wi-fi. The customer service is ok, some are beyond nice, such as setting up a players card, in the restaurant but the hotel management is not always the best. But in that sense you are still getting a deal with what you pay for. \n\nDefiantly would stay again not the first place but if I had to stay cheaply or got screwed  again by the airlines I know I could get a room, quickly too, and it would be clean and a good place to sleep as well as continue to gamble and be close to the action.
3;"A few years ago, I came to outback almost every week.  Their food was amazing and I love their complimentary bread that they give.  But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.\n\nBUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.\n\nThe entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer. \n\nAppetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or \""chips\"" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.  \n\nService - he was a great and friendly server.  He seemed busy, but he kept all of us content and no complaints at all.  \n\nI think I am in love with outback again!"
0;I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fianc\u00e9 is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had. \nMia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte.
2;"I enjoyed this sushi place. When I was attending UNLV for my Master's, I came here for lunch with fellow classmates. It was never crowded at lunch time and early dinner time. The food was always very fresh, but the prices were elevated, considering that the food selection was anything but special. \n\nThe food selection was just run of the mill sushi place. Nothing too tradtional or too novel, yet it was good. I probably won't come here very often unless I am in UNLV area. There is nothing \""special\"" about this sushi place, but it is better and fresher than many in the Vegas area.\n\nService is poor and prices are high, especially for being located almost right on a college campus. Servers and owners could use an attitude adjustment and lower their prices and then I would be a slightly more loyal customer."
4;"I've been to Postino Central about five times in the last two months.  The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well. I have gone with small groups of 3-4 and larger groups of 9+, and we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. The outdoor seating can get a bit warm in hotter months, though.  The parking is complimentary (complimentary + tip, actually), so make sure you have some cash on hand, or the Light Rail is just about a block away or less. \n\nThe wine selection is nice, although I haven't seen a Chianti on the menu. They also carry hard-to-find beers, such as my favorite, Duval and Raspberry Framboise.  The bruschetta is delicious, and there are interesting choices, such as white bean/tomato/basil and fig/apple/cheese, quite tasty!\n\nUpdate: Since I wrote this, about 4-5 trips later, again, wow, I'm so impressed with this place. In October, a friend came to visit and we had a party of 15 on a Saturday night. I made reservations, but they had the table ready to go by 6:55 pm and didn't mind that just three of us sat down while waiting for the others. The servers were quite attentive, and I've never had to wait. I recently brought my mom last week, and she described the food as \""delicious,\"" and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour, delish!  Another perk - it's so chill. I noticed many people wearing jeans or shorts at Postino today, yet some people dress up.\n\nThe only thing that can be annoying - if you can't find parking or if the valets are done for the day, be careful about where you park in the street. I've had friends who got tickets."
3;I'm really glad to learn that I wasn't the only one to get ID'd every other minute! And I look old for my age (a modest 20, or twenteen as I prefer it) so I never, ever get asked to prove it. Maybe they were trying to flatter me.\n\nAnyway, the pub itself, as has been mentioned is more of a novelty than particularly chic. Well that depends on your definition of chic I suppose. If novelty book cases and murder-mystery style is chic to you, then grab your glad-rags.\n\nThe prices are good too, and it's in a good location so you can come here before a night on the town and barely have to bear the walk!
2;Saw it on triple D finally got to try it I got the combo platter lots of meat in the dish. The meat was very good except the sliced ham tasted like turkey ham. Beef rib was not good either sides need work got corn on cob very over boiled. Wife got coleslaw said it was very bland. Overall not bad would go back but would get the chopped meat. Also BBQ sauce a little ketcupy.
3;The more I come here the more I like it. The place is clean, ticket prices are reasonable if not a little more expensive than Harkins, and there usually isn't as much of a crowd.\n\nI have also found the people at this location to be a better behaved bunch during the movies.\n\nThey also will honor the $1 refill Harkins cups which was always one of my big reasons for going to Harkins theaters all the time.\n\nThey don't have the biggest screens in the world though even compared to some other theaters.
1;"Celebrated my mother-in-law 70th birthday dinner, the food was ok...some of the vegetables were cold, lobster tail was a bit salty; however the servers were nice."
3;re:  dinner\n\nThis place is as consistent as any other In-N-Out with less of a wait.  It's a little off the strip, so if you do not have a vehicle if visiting Vegas, it would make it tough to eat here.  If there's such thing as Quality Fast Food, this is it.  *cheers*
4;"One of my new favorite haunts. The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people. You can't look around and see it in the fixtures, it's the conversations, the eclectic hair, the young, the old, the ones with blue chalk wiped on their pants and spilling PBR as they giggle away. The bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes-Daddy Like!\nAND, last but not least, I dig the jukebox and the tunes that get downloaded, alot of punk, new wave and other tunes that I grew up loving."
1;Was so in the mood for BBQ after a round of golf yesterday! We stopped in for take-out, and I have to tell you I was very excited. I love BBQ and rarely get to indulge since my wife isn't a big fan. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The restaurant itself is exactly what you'd expect for great BBQ -- picnic tables, lots of paper towels, cool bar off to the side. I really liked the atmosphere. As we waited for our order, I daydreamed about eating lots of messy BBQ with the guys after my next round of golf. The experience from there was less than positive. Even though I was just there ordering take-out, the two guys at the register weren't very helpful and the wait was pretty long for take-out. The real disappointment came when I saw how little food we got for $90. The BBQ was ok, but it's definitely over-priced for what you get. If you go, I'd recommend the wings and the Tri Tip sandwich, but steer clear of the combo plates. If you have kids, have them split a meal and stay away from the kid meals. Only four puny over-cooked and over-breaded chicken nuggets that my kids didn't like -- and they love all chicken nuggets. If you love BBQ and are a big eater, bring extra money and order big.
3;Set along the decaying ruins of Las Vegas Boulevard South, Rincon Criollo is a true departure from the glitter and gulch of Vegas. There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban sandwiches. The staff seems to be all Cuban, and prepare everything in big pots in the back kitchen. They treat you with genuine hospitality, and aren't particularly concerned with turning the table and running up the tab. Sit there as long as you like and peer through the dusty storefront windows at the sunburnt downtown avenues. It is probably impossible to stay or visit downtown, see the humble immigrant businesses and the few tawdry titty bars set along a background of near shantytowns, and not question how so much glamour and wealth could neighbor such impoverishment. \n\nIn any case, turning back to the Rincon interior you'll find one whole wall engulfed by an aging aerial photo of Havana. The picture displays the Malecon sea wall as it weaves along the waterfront. The water is that tepid blue that suggests a photograph from the sixties or seventies. We ate under its shadow and thoroughly enjoyed what might be characterized as a repast, under the watchful eye of our waitress, who bore a helpful smile our entire meal. After we'd finished, we walked back out into the hot Vegas sun and stood along the unforgiving pavement for a few minutes, soaking in the strangely charmless vista of Old Vegas. Strange place for a Cuban restaurant, but in its oddly dislocated way it seemed to fit right in.
2;This place has lost a star.  Ok, I love my club host, who totally sets me up with getting into places, and he didn't disappoint here either... \n\nbut maybe it was the night I was there (fri) or the crowd or something, but it was just off.  Like not good off the hook, off.\n\nThe club wasn't nearly as busy as it usually is, there were tables empty, the bartenders were actually smiling and waiting to help serve you, rather than being 5 deep in customers, and there was no wait for the women's bathroom.  (that right there should tell you 'something is wrong')\n\ndrinks were good, i can't say I didn't have fun, but by 1am i was ready to go, and headed back to the strip to do some other clubs.
4;We enjoyed Brio last night for Christmas Eve dinner.  Shared the calamari appetizer and it was very tasty, lightly coated in flour and fried, served with a marinara sauce and a cream sauce. We tried the Shrimp Verduta, Crab Cakes, and Veal Milanese, there were no complaints about food or portions at our table! The chocolate cake and vanilla gelato was a perfect ending, not too sweet, and enough for us to share.  Service was excellent, our waitress Jatae was pleasant and helpful.  Cocktails were generous and priced right.  Thanks Brio, we will return!
1;This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \n\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \n\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.
3;Yummy food with a really good value. I have now been here twice in less then a month. First time was by stumbling onto it on accidents while trying to find another Philly cheese place I had a coupon for. They have a walk up window where you watch the grill master make your sandwiches.\n\nBoth times I got the mushroom, pepper and onion philly.Juicey, cheesy and big! Room mate got the pastrami both times as well. Another big juicy sandwich. I normally don't like pastrami minus a place in Cali name The Hat! Stole a bite to try it and may actually get it next time. We have had the fried green beans , yummy with a thick ranch sauce. The sweet potato fries with some sort of coconut dipping sauce. They should be considered a sin. So sweet and yummy. Whole reason I went back a second time was to have my friend try them with a to go order.\n\nAlso had the banana fosters bites. First one was yummy second one was ok, third one I only had the half of before I stopped eating it. Tasted like warm banana pudding with a soggy graham cracker crust and deep fried with a thin batter. Think they were store bought  rather then made on location. A good thing to try in a group but I won't be ordering them again for just me.  \n\nPrices are good for the amount of food you get. Main and pretty much only draw back I can think of is no indoor seating. Definitely going back more in the summer . Right on the street and fun to watch passing traffic but in the winter its a bit to cold. We wolfed down our food as quickly as we could the first time, and wised up the second time with a to go order. If you like Philly Cheese this is a great place to go  and well worth the drive even if it is across town!
4;Unbelievably great.
3;Sticker. Sticker. Sticker.\n\nSticker shock when I saw the bill!\n\nThank goodness it wasn't my turn. Lol. \n\nEverything was good. It's in a decent location, to where they can change you premium solely for location, but it's definitely a delight. \n\nEverything was delicious. The service was exceptional. \n\nWould definitely dine again.
2;I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.
2;Not a whole lot of flare going on with Maki Taco, but good food nonetheless!  I picked up some of their tacos right before they packed it up for the night during a minor brewery crawl.  I brought a decent sized group, so we got to try the staple tacos. \n\nFirst of all, the average order is between $7-$9's for three tacos and that is a lot of food! \nThe food came out relatively quick, around 10 minutes and all four orders were out right after the other.  We had the Korean Bulgogi Steak Tacos that definitely brought some heat with the red peppers and tang via the marinade.  The Teriyaki Chicken Taco's were flavorful, but the safe option to choose.  Lastly, we split the Thai coconut Chicken Taco's and they were exceptional!  Overall the tacos were seasoned well and juicy, but had more vegetables as filler at the forefront than meat.      \n\nThe guys running the truck were nice and efficient and I would definitely go back if I ever crossed paths with 'em in NoDa again.
1;"Argh. Groan. Kind of a waste of money. My feelings about the ice bare are all over the place honestly. I'm going to with 2 stars, because even though I thought it was \""okay\"" it still isn't that entertaining.\n\nBut... It's an experience I can tick off my list at least! I went with a group of four and we all purchased the $15 general admission - jacket and gloves. When we got in it was empty! There were only a few people in there. Mind you, this was a Friday night on Halloween weekend! So we got free shots (poor, watered down) and took some pictures. \n\nYou have to deposit your cameras and cell phones into a locker outside before you go in. That's so they can rape you with the prices of purchasing the pictures THEY take of you. As if it isn't already overpriced to be paying $15 to go freeze and look at ice.\n\nI mean, it's a cool thing to do if you have the money to throw around, but if you just want to get drunk and party - go elsewhere! Also, make sure you go with a big group, you'll have a better time."
0;"I wish I could rate the food, but we didn't even get a chance to try so full disclosure only rating the service. We made a reservation a day before, get to the restaurant and it was clear by the hostess' reaction they weren't expecting us. It was clear they made a makeshift table for our party...in the hallway. \n\nThere were people coming and going and it felt we were in their way. My dad had politely requested a clearly open table, and was told it had already been reserved for a larger table. The table stayed open for a while, only to be filled by a party our exact same size. \n\nAfter seeing this my dad again, politely, requested a table that wasn't in the middle of the hallway. We were eventually told they could accommodate us, then we waited. And waited and waited some more. We ended up waiting an hour and sipped on cheap yet overpriced wine. We finally had enough and then packed our things and left when we realized not only would we not be moved to another table we were purposely not going to be served because of our table request. \n\nWe left an hour after we were \""seated\"" in the hallway. When we let the manager and hostess know we were leaving, without making any sort of scene, they threw their hands up in the air emphatically as if to insinuate our leaving was our own problem. \n\nWe left, went to I heart burgers instead and had a fabulous, low key night with delightful food and wonderful service. And most importantly we actually were seated and treated like human beings. Moral of the story: overpriced food and horrible service, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"
0;Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?
2;Came here for my b-day with hubby.  Loved the salad bar !  I agree with the other reviews you must be a meat lover to fully enjoy it.    I was so stuff I did not get a chance to try the flank steak or top sirloin.   I do agree with the other posts the swordfish was too dry and salmon was good.  \n\nI usually like my red meats medium but I found out they were to well done.  I  ordered it medium rare instead.  \n\nI also had the passion fruit chocolate mousse for dessert.  It was delicious very much different tasting. Never had anything like that before.  Overall the place was really nice and service was very good.. Next visit,  I  will just order the salad bar and fish instead.
1;1st day for Cardinal football.  Thought this would be perfect. They raised beer prices by a quarter big deal. But the bad part is no sound for the cardinals game and they kept the juke box going.  We complained about it and they said to bad but the Dallas game that night we could listen to it.  Last year the girls could wear jerseys during football but not this year.  Thanks but no thanks
4;Great breakfast restaurant near Desert Ridge in North Phoenix--good natural, organic food.  Had chorizo and eggs, great presentation and absolutely delicious!\n\nWill be back for dinner service and can't wait to sample some organic wines!
4;Super speedy online ordering and they come to your house so quick! Can't beat that. Hey it's Chinese food, not rocket science. It gets the job done for those awesome cravings. I am not a frequent diner at Chinese food restaurants, but all I know is that this tastes great and is delivered fast for my lazy days. Can't beat that.
3;This place has one of my all-time FAVORITE Asian dishes - the Thai Spicy Noodles. Yeah, generic sounding as heck but it's really thin noodles with woked chicken & shrimp, scallions, egg, cabbage and I can't remember what else, with Thai spice. Squeeze a huge wedge of lemon over it and I'm in heaven. One order is enough to feed me, my hubby and our teen daughter, but we usually get two... it's sooo tasty when it's cold. Breakfast of champions. Their honey chicken is really good, in fact I can't think of any dish that we have not liked. Their appetizers are yummy, and they do both spring and egg rolls. That's handy for a family of mixed disciples. :) \n\nThe service is always very smiley and friendly, and there's never been a wait. Totally good Asian food for a very decent price, in a clean restaurant. What more could you want??
3;"I'm gonna describe Tryst in these words \""Hella Good Music!!\"" haha though I'm not \""bay area\"" material, that's the only way I could explain Tryst.  We went here first for our drink tickets and then moved our way to XS, but Tryst convinced us to come back afterward because they play better music! If you're gonna play \""N***as in Paris\"" by Jay-Z and Kanye, you have me there all night! hahaha\n\nThey also have a pole available to dance on. I think this is essential for clubs because it gets people going! I've been here twice and I had great experiences both times."
4;Very good happy hour, great wine and cheese selections. Service was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!
3;Never heard of this place.  Really cool spot!  Nice ambience. Not too many parking spots here.  All of the appetizers were pretty great. The service was good.  They remembered special requests.  The server did forget to clear the menus and there wasn't space when the appetizers arrived. \n\nAhi salad - would not order this again. Giant heap of cole slaw with tasteless ahi tuna  \nLobster mac and cheese- there was something in this I didn't care for the taste of.  It was something with a strong and distinct aftertaste.  I'm not sure if it is a seasoning but it was overpowering. \nPork belly- very yummy!  Cut in small enough pieces. Crunchy and tasty! \nGuacamole - tasted fresh and satisfying \nPizza - this was better than my entree and I was happier eating this. Thin and simple\n\nThe appetizers here are really great.  I feel there were options on the menu id like to try. This place has a lot of potential. It seems like it would be a great place to grab some drinks before a night out.
2;Don't be afraid to try this place out for size. The rooms are small (as all older hotel rooms are) but well appointed. The casino itself has a vintage appeal with alot of historic items on display. the 777 Brewery is suberb and will exceed your expectations. No pool though.
1;I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there.
4;"This the 2nd time I have seen the show and I swear it just gets better. I literally could not laugh anymore! If you truly want to laugh your ass off then you need to go see Carrot Top... You will not regret it!!!! \nI have sent everyone who comes to town for a visit to the show and they all agree \""it's hilarious\"""
3;My favorite ramen on the Eastside! So glad I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get some great ramen. Our server is always so nice and sweet & she practically knows me already! My favorite is the Fukumimi Ramen with thick noodles and extra egg! YUMMMMM!
1;If you are thinking about going here because someone told you it's like Chipotle but better... they lied!! We went at about 8pm the meat looked old, they charge extra for peppers... The freshness you would get from Chipotle was lacking.
2;In a convient location for me between work and home.   Store is easy to get around, and find whatever you are looking for.  The store staff seems to be helpful the times I have came in.  I prefer the home depot up the road off of ray just because the staff is more knowledgeable, and have been more helpful to myself.
0;I've been to other Bravo locations before and have had wonderful experiences. I'm not sure what's going on with this Charlotte location...\n\n1. I was told they were out of Caesar salad. What Italian restaurant runs out of Caesar salad?!\n\n2. My entree was good, but rather salty.\n\n3. Our waiter basically ignored us the entire time. I spent much of the dinner trying to figure out if he was just new or confused as to what his job description entailed. He seemed to have no problem checking on his other tables.\n\n4. It took literally FOREVER for our drinks to arrive. I don't care how busy  you are it doesn't take 25 minutes to bring me a beer that's not even on draft!\n\n5. I don't normally care how long it takes to clear plates off a table but when the entree plates are crammed into the corner of the tiny table while I'm trying to eat dessert I have a problem.
0;People working there are so rude. They chatting with coworker while I am waiting to check out. They told me to wait. And the cashiers so rude, no smile, anger faces. Make me feel uncomrtable.
2;Conveniently located inside of Caesars Palace... However, they're not a part of the Total Rewards program that Caesars is a part of. \n\nWhy would this matter? Well, cause you can't claim your free birthday drink here! \n\nWhile not my personal favorite, it's not a bad bar to try...
4;So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!
4;this place is AWESOME. not only did they fix my car really quickly, the job was superb and the guys behind the desk were really friendly, professional, warm and accommodating. i felt like i'd been a customer here for years or they were greeting an old friend. women can get sidelined in places like this, but nope, treated with nothing but respect and courtesy. the price was fair for all the work they did and they added in some coupons to help me out. love them, will definitely go back.
0;Attempted to Griffintown Caf\u00e9 today but due to short staff or poor administration,\nI cant even give this place a star because we never made it in. We were 2, and when we got there, there were 6 free tables. We stood there for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to seat us. All the while noticing that the people who were seated all had their menus and were looking annoyed like they hadn't been served yet. Then all of a sudden the party of 4 standing behind us somehow gets seated and the waitress doesn't say anything to us. We wait another 10 or so minutes and the people who we initially saw seated with menus had still not been served. At this point we waited another 5 minutes (still not seated despite the 6 free tables) and then just decided it would probably be an hour or so until we actually ate if we stayed there so we went elsewhere.\nWTF? I can understand if the place is brimming to full capacity but when you have 6 open tables and you can't manage to seat the few people at the door and serve the customers that are already seated there are major issues. \nSorry not going back.
4;Great hidden gem hiking trails. It has to be on of my favorite trails in town. No traffic or people and lots of options on paths. We only passed one biker. Gorgeous views that make you feel your in N. AZ.
0;Definitely didn't love this bar. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch. Location was great in the Harrah's casino, but that's honestly the only thing that I can say was great. The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's.
3;For years, I longed for a truly fine bakery in Urbana-Champaign, and then Jack Kostrub opened Mirabelle Fine Pastry.  The bakery produces exceptional loaves and pastries, both savory and sweet.  We are special fans of the focaccia, from the traditional flat loaves topped with sea salt and rosemary or red onions and tomatoes, to the thick wedges piled with feta cheese and roasted veg.  \n\nThe almond horn, tipped with chocolate, I purchased yesterday is an example of the quality of the bakery's sweets.  The outside had a slight crunch of roasted almond slices, while the inside was dense, moist, and chewy and tasted of the most delicate amaretto.  The chocolate was darkly sweet, perfectly complementing the almond flavor.  Heavenly.  \n\nPlus, Mirabelle is located in Urbana's gallery district, with the wonderful Heartland Gallery just down the block, among other treasures.  If you'd like lunch, too, you can hop right across the street to La Gourmandise.  Or, you can get take-away at Mirabelle, which includes savory stuffed croissants and simple, delicious baguette and loaf bread sandwiches.\n\nOn Fridays at lunchtime, the bakery recently started a piled high roast beef sandwich tradition, steeped in au jus.  I have not had one yet, but a local business owner sends in his folks every week to pick up a batch -- they swear by them.\n\nMy only complaints: 1) popular items run out early, 2) flies, flies, flies in the bakery and cases (especially in the summer, when the door is propped), 3) somewhat surly and negligent counter service.
1;"It's been about two years since we went to MBFG in Old Town. After we were seated and already ordered the Saganaki, I realized why we hadn't been in such a long time . . . the place is a d-u-m-p!  The only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a Greek restaurant is the startling cry of \""Opa!\"" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.  \n\nOnce I got past that, I was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  Apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only Greek varieties available. Greek wine? Would it taste like ouzo? The water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.\n\nSaganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!\n\nI have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  The Old Town location is like eating in a cave.  If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . ."
4;this place is amazing! i came here through the recommendation of a friend while staying at the palace station this weekend and let me tell you the wait (yes there's always a wait) is SO WELL WORTH IT. everything was seasoned to perfection the oysters were fresh, and the staff was incredible and hilarious. so sad i didn't have a fridge in my room to keep my leftovers but i'll be returning again for sure!
0;Oh my god. that's worst service. The staff is not very polite. I feel very bad, food is OK, one star, I won't go back to eat.
0;I officially give up on this location!  I would this give this location zero stars if I could. I stopped going through the drive thru because they could never give me 100% of my order. I ordered carry out inside and got home without everything I paid for...again!!  If you are charging me for all white meat, then give me what I paid for!!! It's just not that hard of a concept to grasp. It's super aggravating to get all the way home and not have what you ordered and paid extra for. Having to run back out to go argue over what was or wasn't in the bag is too inconvenient.  Sorry, but I won't be coming back.
4;"From the street this place looks tiny, but make your way down the stairs inside or the (slightly) rickety metal steps down from George IV bridge and you'll find an elegant dining room where they serve one of the best lunch deals in Edinburgh: a starter, mains, and two sides for about seven quid.\n\n\n The food is upmarket without being pretentious; and if I can't speak of their desserts that at least tells you the portions are more than hearty and didn't leave any room to try them! My companion qualified her starter of tomato and basil soup as pretty much a meal in itself.\n\n\n Very good service too in formal yet relaxed surroundings. Don't watch the large clock on the wall and let your lunch hour go..."
3;What a great way to spend an evening.  This was our first time at this location.  The seats are 360 around the stage so the acting caters to all directions.  \n\nThe singing was better than I expected, the wigs in the actors were a little cheesy, but it was a fun night.  The only negative thing I have to say is that with it being Arizona, the majority of the crowd was geriatric so they would try and whisper but it was really loud.  It was a bit distracting but they were having fun so it was easier to overlook.\n\nOne tip, come early bc parking fills up quickly. There are several restaurants nearby so dinner and then the show is a good idea.
1;Eh, just OK.  I wasn't wowed by the food, and my horchata was very watery and too sweet (and served in a leaking broken cup).  In addition, there was a long wait to be seated, and once we were, service was a bit spotty.
3;"When you first come into the area it seems to be in a kinda sketchy but once you get inside it's BEAUTIFUL!  Very High Class.  I felt like the richest man in all of Las Vegas.  We used a living social coupon for the place and I dare say we'll do it again.  \n\nOnce you check-in and pay there are 2 different locker rooms, male and female.  Connected to those locker rooms are showers, hot and cold jacuzzi pools, steam saunas, and salt saunas (my wife said the women's side had an herbal sauna; I didn't find one in the men's).  \n\nThe second level has 3 different heat sauna rooms: clay ball room, adobe clay room, jade and eucalyptus room, and an ice room. There is also a yoga room and a little restaurant. You could probably spend all day going in and out of the rooms.  They also offer massages, for a fee.  We didn't get the couples massage 'cause we're cheap, but everything else is amazing.  \n\nAll the patrons there were very nice and talkative, as were the workers.  If you need a day to relax and sweat out all the toxins, this is your place.  I plan on going back again and again.  I would have given 5 stars but the messages were pretty pricey.  Other than that great experience."
4;Love me some Genghis Grill.  Always exactly what I want, because I get to pick exactly what I want.  It is flavorful, cooked to perfection and the staff is always great.\n\nThey always have a pair of chop stick helpers for my little one so she can feel like a chop stick pro.  \n\nI highly recommend taking your kids here.  My girl tends to eat more veggies or try new things when she can see it before it is cooked, and see other people trying it too.
1;I stopped eating here last summer.  I have a rule.  I cross any place off my list when I'm too distracted by all the flies to pick something from the menu.  \n\nI'd give one star, but, the saving grace is that all the flies are dead in the winter.  And Madison has a lot of winter.
4;This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them.
1;Stopped in for breakfast about 9:00 AM on a Monday.  It was not crowded.  The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP - tasty.  The noise level in this place was awful.  The music (50's music) was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers.  Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did.
4;I've eaten at Brama before and my experience was so memorable that when my birthday rolled around recently, I decided to invite one dozen friends to celebrate with me.\nWhatever catastrophe can happen with groups, did not happen here. From the moment my guests walked in (2 by 2), the bartender greeted them warmly and served drinks. Additionally our waitress was great - she served with a smile throughout the night. The food was what I had remembered - really impeccable and created with such skill. Everything on the menu is good. My group really enjoyed their dishes and the ambiance (lively without the overkill of music - we could hear each other talk). To top off another wonderful culinary experience, the owner of the restaurant always took the time to come by and see if everything was to our liking.\nThanks again Brama - you are great with groups too!!\n\nVisited January 2014
0;The staff is not friendly at all. When u ask them to toast the sub or to add toppings, u can see from there faces that they are burdened. I understand that I go early when they open, but that doesn't give them the right to act like the way they do. The don't really say hi at all, instead I end up saying how Ur doing. If I had a choice to not to go to this branch, I would totally avoide this one.
4;After living in Japan for 4 years, I'm very particular about the kind of ramen I eat. However, Ramen Sora blew my taste buds. The corn butter ramen with miso broth was decadent, rich, and literally melted in my mouth. I get it everytime I come here. It's average price, about $8-$10 a bowl, but it is so worth it.
4;Great discounted price! They have a wide selection of Ray-Bans. I wished they had more D&G's though and a separate section for men. Sheryl was very patient with me. She knew the style I wanted, the moment I described to her the look I was going for. Got my new glasses in 1.5 hours.
3;Visited friend John Mo in Pittsburgh for one night and he brought me here...great move. Big fatty sandwich but really really delicious.
0;Went here for a nice dinner before a show. The bartender decided he knew girls better than we knew ourselves and insisted on making us fruity martinis rather than the dry martini we requested. Finally he agreed, and he made the two worst martinis ever. When we didn't drink them and ordered wine, he made fun of us for not liking our drinks.  He was the most annoying bartender I've ever experienced. Then our Red wine came in HOT milk glasses.  It was gross.  And the food? Mediocre is too generous of a description.
3;Wow, I'm surprised with most of the reviews here because I am in love with this restaurant.  I've been here a good dozen times since it opened and can't get enough.\n\nStart with the grilled artichoke appetizer.  The chef takes a whole (giant) artichoke, removes the choke, steams it until almost done and then finishes it off on the grill.  The artichoke comes out sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and with a mustardy dip on the side.  Amazing.\n\nAlso, the salads are delicious.  My personal favorite is the seared ahi tuna salad.  It comes with a great champagne dressing and a huge serving of sesame encrusted seared tuna.  So good.  The steak cobb salad is also really good with melt in your mouth croutons, avocado and a great dressing.\n\nI've always had great service here and the food is consistently great.
0;"This location is the WORST!  Staff is completely RUDE and disrespectful!  I go to this location a lot because of the drive thru.  Everytime I go I ask myself why did I come here again!  The slowest drive thru in the history of driver thru's!  Today I waited in the drive thru line literally 10 minutes - and there was only ONE car ahead of me!  That was just after 11:00 am.  The sign advertises on price but every time I go they charge me a different price when I get to the window!  Today I was not having it, I was only paying for what the sign on the price advertised.  $4.49 for the Mango Magic smoothies and 99 cents for whey protein.  Somehow they calculate this to be $6.30!  THAT is the most I've ever been charged. The idiot guy at the window said well that is the price and I argued with him and said well the sign says something else and I'm only paying what the sign says!  He got what he called was his manager, some young girl who was just as rude as him and said well they changed the prices yesterday.  Ok well, thats not my problem.  The price on the sign says this and that is all I\""m paying... she continued to argue with me. At this point I should have just drove off.  But she said she's give me a discount.  I don't want a discount, I only want to pay what the sigh says.  So long story short I paid $5.18 .  That is LESS than what the sign says... but whatever, I paid it and got out of there.  Needless to say, I will NEVER use this location again, that was the last straw!  The only good thing I can say is that the smoothie was blended well and tasted good.  As for service and courtesy of the staff, I'd give that a ZERO stars if I could it was that bad, and its consistently that bad, this isn't a one time occurrence, which is why I'm finally writing a review! Bad service one or even twice I can overlook but when its consistently BAD EVERY TIME I GO THERE I gotta give a bad review!  How about getting someone in from the corporate office in there to see what the heck is going on and replace the idiot kids you have working there!"
4;It's quite gimmicky, you always know what to expect and there are never really any surprises thrown in and it's a guarantee that the food is going to be top notch! My burger of choice is always the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger it's just so good! \n\nThe walls are adorned with lots of musical memorabilia to give you lots to look at when enjoying your meal. Worldwide the Hard Rock Cafe have over 70,000 instruments on the walls of their restaurants which is the biggest and most valuable collection in the world. Wow.\n\nDuring my years at High School I came to the Hard Rock Cafe pretty much every year for my birthday party and most of my friends did the same, I'm surprised I'm not sick of the place. My friends and I always found the fillings in the burgers funny and you will often find  slice of tomato or onion ring the size of a small childs head. On one occasion I remember my friend took an onion ring home because she found it so funny, to be fair we were only around 13 and hey, simple minds simple pleasures, I guess.\n\nIf you do go for a birthday party the staff will be more than happy to sing a rather embarrassing Happy Birthday to you and present you with a cake or a huge ice-cream sundae. The ice-cream sundaes are phenomenal but I'd recommend getting one to share if you want to fit through the door on your way out. Hard Rock Cafe is fun, great for families, smalls or large groups and is always a great option if you're looking for a hearty burger. I'm a fan!
4;Did ya drive down here? Don't forget to fill up at Costco! Cheaper than the Strip, obviously! You can also grab a bite to eat since you're here. Love the polish dogs and cheap slices of pizza. \n\nThe lines aren't too long and moves fairly quickly. Woot! I like that you can extend the line so it doesn't really matter which side your gas tank is on. They have an attendant there in case there are any trouble. Get in and get out!
0;"Aria charges a $25 resort fee, which includes internet access.  However, what they don't tell you is that fee includes on 512K internet access - not close to what I would consider \""high speed\"" and barely functional for business use.  To get 1.5MB you need to pay an additional $15 a day.\n\nA true 5 star resort should be up front with its fees.  Instead, Aria takes the significantly less classy approach of nickel and diming its customers."
1;This place reminds me of a fast food joint, quality of food isn't that great, but I'll still come here if I'm in the mood of mexican food and I'm at the red rock casino. Other than that it's not all that great, I'd rather go to other restaurants in the food court. Not much of a big fan here. Taqueria's blow this place away, but this particular place I'd settle for if I want a burrito or taco's of some sort. Ehhhh
3;Came in here last week with low expectations based on the reviews, but was impressed. The first time I ate here I had dinner at the bar. Filet was perfect, Burrata Mozz rivaled some of the best I've had in the North End and Darren W's service was awesome - essentially close to 5 star. The Fries are a must - incredible.\n\nSecond time around, I had another Filet which was completely off the mark. Based on this, JG is hit or miss or worthy of 4 stars.
2;Went here for a quick dinner. Food was just average, not too special and not as good as I would expect in the Mexican restaurant. I had an impression that we were a bit neglected by the waiter and waitress, maybe because we had a small order and didn't feel like drinking tons of alcohol, not sure. Salsa was good, but I need a bit more to Mexican restaurant than a good salsa.
2;"So, it was our first visit to Pelican Bay, and we'll certainly be returning!\n\nNow, their prices are a bit...steep(I'm talking about normal menu items, not specials). However, it's just around the corner from us, and such a lovely, cozy little hole-in-the-wall that I can't resist loving it.\n\nI had the peel-and-eat-shrimp(regular...I'll have to try Cajun-style another time). it consisted of about 25 small shrimp and a side of cocktail sauce(I think it was housemade). I added some of the Tapatio hot sauce(there's a bottle on every table), and enjoyed my shrimp whilst swigging 2 Negra Modelos. my meal(excluding the beer) was $9.95\n\nJamie had the steak sandwich--a giant slab of steak on hoagie bread. price? $9.95. it came with french fries(effing FABULOUS steak fries)...but apparently, they were $2 extra. wtf? whatever...they were well worth it; so amazing drizzled with malt vinegar(again, a bottle on every table) and salt.\n\nour total bill? $29.50. a little crazy, to be honest...but, the bartender(owner?) was attentive, and they have a fabulous selection of seafood and Mexican food. unfortunately, the beer selections were lacking. stick with Negra, and you're golden.\n\nnext time...either the seafood cocktail(octopus optional), the ceviche tostada, or the steamed clams :p"
4;"I LOVE THIS COFFEE SHOP!!!\n\nI am impressed with Sunrise Coffee for so many reasons, but mainly because they are doing RIGHT what so many other coffee shops fail to do: An EXCELLENT cup of coffee!!! \n\nIt's been my mission to find authentic, handcrafted espresso drinks in Vegas, and I have finally found it in Sunrise. It's my only \""go to\"" coffee shop from here on out, I don't care that it's across town, it's more than worth it. It's so perfect, reminds me of the great coffee houses of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, but on a smaller scale. It's very clean and modern, the employees were friendly and had a refreshing attitude. Their espresso is the best I've had in Las Vegas, and it's close to the airport and has a drive thru! \n\nSo crazy in love with this place. WOW!!!"
4;I cannot tell you how amazing this place was.  I wish my university had something like this!  The terrace gives you access to all of the basic staples of life, sausages, burgers, ice cream, beer, all of which are to be enjoyed on a beautiful terrace overlooking the lake full of kayaks, sailboats, and so on.\n\nI focused mostly on the sausage and beer when I was here.  I got a grilled bratwurst on a great bun, and that just left me hungry to try the italian sausage, which also comes with grilled onions and peppers, and marinara sauce.  All of this was washed down with two different local beers, which I thought were pretty darn good.
3;I normally don't comment on service because that always varies depending on who you get, but I must say that our waitress was amazing. She seemed to be the only one working the whole restaurant, but I didn't notice. My drink was never more than half empty and she was working her butt off! Extra star just for her.\n\nA little local sports bar with a pretty extensive menus- dinner entrees, salads, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, etc. I was only expecting pub dishes when we saw this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both ordered the Western burger. Overall solid burger- the patty itself was a little under seasoned, but the BBQ sauce had a good flavor and I enjoyed every bite.  \nHad the Frings on the side- fries and onion rings and they were delicious. Everything was crispy and well seasoned. \n\nGreat little joint to stop in to watch the game and have a well cooked meal. Great selection for a bar.
3;I really love this place! my family and I came here once they started on their vegetarian  kick many years ago, and boy we weren't disappointed. \n\nTheir falafels are to die for and the lamb salad is crisp and fresh. My sister is in love with the chicken hummus plate, they provide you with a large serving and it tastes amazing! The hummus is smooth and rich in flavor. \n\nEvery time I'm on a date or am looking for a fun food place with friends i bring them to Aladdin's. My sister even ordered their food for her graduation party. They are great for any occasion!
2;Loved the look of this place as it was going up. The completion is fantastic from the outside. Gorgeous architecture. HOWEVER, INSIDE THE SCALE IS STERILE AND NOT HUMAN. (forgive caps) None of the shops or restaurants are for normal or even semi normal people as far as price is concerned. Even for Vegas the  prices are off the wall. See loads of people in Crystals but very few with shopping bags. This place was built in the middle of the biggest bubble in a century. It opened in the biggest bust. I predict this $8+ billion  baby will bankrupt MGM. Judging by the price I got for Aria in a few weeks occupancy is not that high. Looking at the restaujrant reviedws on YELP I'm not about to try any.
4;For my birthday, I was treated to an outstanding 9 course meal at the glamorous Number One restaurant within the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh. Number One is a well known Michelin-starred restaurant which is regarded as one of Scotland's best. The team is lead by Executive Chef Jeff Bland, who uses top Scottish ingredients to create edible art which both fascinated me and tasted incredible.\n\n\nWe started with cocktails &'canap\u00e9s in the bar - fois gras macaron anyone? Bizarre? Yes, but utterly delicious.\n\nWe decided to have the chef's tasting menu with matched wines. They give you a basic menu which literally gives a basic clue as to what you'll be served. When each course arrived we dissected them and analysed them to discuss the ingredients and cooking methods. It's a foodie thing. We need to work out what herb that's in the sauce, or how the salmon was cooked!\n\nWe had a selection of breads to choose from to begin with - I opted for a cheese and caramelised onion loaf. It was divine. I'm not going to give a blow by blow breakdown of each dish - there is so much detail that I could go into, and I think the pictures on my blog speak for themselves. \n\nThis meal, or should I say culinary experience, was just brilliant. The only meal I can compare it to is Restaurant 21212, but as they're both very different, I couldn't possibly pick a favourite. The restaurant is low lit, comfortably quiet and spaced and beautifully decorated. The staff are absolutely fantastic: you're served by a host of staff from waiting staff to a sommelier. Everything is explained, the food is beautifully cooked and presented. The service was slick and yet not too pretentious (yes, there is such a thing). I'd recommend dining here to absolutely anyone who enjoys top quality food.\n\nAfter our meal we decided to try out the trendy Balmoral Bar! A fantastic night!
1;Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.
4;I have taken cars there 6 or so times. I have had only positive experiences with them and their rates are cheaper than most garages around. I saw reviews speaking of their misdiagnosing a problem. They actually fixed a problem for me that was misdiagnosed at another similar business in Chandler. Their staff is very nice as is their facility.
4;Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store
3;Here are the pros and cons\nPro: with coupons (found at dessert ridge office, also on the website and special events they put on) the food is reasonable. We often eat there for about $20 including drinks for 4. \nThe food is tasty, at least what I have tried, steak kabob, various standard sides, chips are homemade are some of the best I have ever had plus the teas are quite good, not too sweet.\nCons: the person behind the counter either makes it or breaks it. We have been here 3 times and it's been inconsistent as far as portion sizes are concerned and personality of the server. I have never been offered a sample but have seen numerous other people offered. \nSeems like a bunch of young unsupervised kids work there. The bad part of that is you don't know what you will get when you dine there. \nStill I give it four stars because it is tasty every time.
4;Go to the Jardins De Lumiere close to 9PM, when the crowds have thinned significantly. I was there at 7PM, and the Jardin Chinoise was at capacity. \n\nBesides this minor complaint, it was a very surreal experience. The cold air, the almost surreal placement of the displays (whether it's butterflies, pagodas, or people) and the way it's almost encouraged that you take your time going through each lighted piece.\n\nThe Jardin Japonais is equally beautiful, albeit in its own way. There's none of the exhibition pieces--instead the whole garden is a dazzling spectacle of lights in different colors and intensities.\n\nAllow yourself plenty of time to appreciate the two gardens. It's a wonderful experience.
3;Good prices on a lot of cool stuff.  .  The sweets and snacks were on sale 3 for 2, bought some Pizza flavored Gamer Grub here and it's great.  Now I don't have to eat all that greasy food whilst I PvP.\n\nGreat selection of cool stuff and friendly helpful staff.
1;The food is good, but the times we've been here and had questions, the servers have never known how to explain items on the menu or even what's in it. When we ask, 'How would you explain Kenyan food?' Our waiter responded, 'Uhhh...it's similar to American food.' When we asked, 'What is Menudo,' he just froze up like a deer in headlights until one of us looked it up and said, 'I think that's stomach.'\n\nThe servers are nice and the atmosphere is quiet and intimate.  Unfortunately, they just don't train their staff well enought to know their product.
1;I heard great reviews about the Walnut Grill and was excited to try the new restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. I have been to the one in Shadyside a few times and always had a pleasant experience.  Today was not a pleasurable experience. Although the staff was friendly, the food was quite disappointing.  The decor was clean, bright and joyous, with a great flow between different dining sections.  Loved the look of the bar. It was trendy and a central point of the room, but did not overwhelm the space.\n\nThe blonde hostess working the lunch shift made my experience.  She was nice, professional, and extremely service oriented. Our server was knowledgeable and accommodating throughout lunch service, but left us waiting for the check, nowhere to be found for a good 10 or so minutes.  \n\nThe ahi tuna appetizer was a great light appetizer.  Although it didn't taste like fresh ahi (definitely frozen), it was seared nicely.  The bed of slaw could be a smaller portion.  It was unevenly mixed, meaning large full pepper slices among, small bite-size slivers of cabbage and carrots.  The Spinach and Artichoke dip was oily. I mean a pool of oil in it.  It definitely tasted like they microwaved an old batch.  Although I love large artichoke pieces in my dip, the chips were smaller than more of the pieces. Maybe pita bread would be better suited for this dish. There were too many tortilla chips and crackers for the portion of dip you received.  The tortilla chips were also stale.  The side of sweet potato fries were undercooked and unflavored.  My mother said they usually have a bit of sugar on them, but unfortunately not today.\n\nThe 2 women next to us were both upset about their meals. One sent her sandwich back because it was burnt and the other's crab cake was overcooked.\n\n\nMaybe they have a new daytime chef? Maybe just a bad day? Either way, not for me.
4;Tons of Wells Fargos in the area but this is the only one open on Sundays (11-5) and open late till 7pm mon-sat. These are the Vegas conveniences I really missed when I moved.  \n\n It's a small, but full service branch nside an albertsons. Pretty long lines on a Sunday, but my teller was quick, friendly and super helpful
0;I guess my palate just doesn't appreciate the coffee these guys serve up. For those of you you do like their stuff... Enjoy!
0;We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.\n\nIf a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will.
1;"Well, they definitely enforce the dress code. Ladies, don't rely on your looks! If you aren't wearing the shortest dress ever, forget it. The club felt like a cheesy version of Vegas and everything was totally overpriced. If not for the good company of friends, I would've peaced out to a more comfortable club.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this club is the entire attitude. On their Facebook page they happily say Scottsdale is \""going downhill\"" and credit themselves with bringing them out of it by having a retarded dress code. They think the \""upper class\"" should remain the upper class. Right, you charge $10 for a cover in Arizona. Go to LA where they charge $45 or more for a mediocre club and get back to me about that upper class. \n\n\nOnly pros - the bathroom was interesting. Bizarre really. Not bad, not good, just different. Good place for hitting on people. The staff was actually strangely nice to people in line. One guy was particularly hot and funky."
3;We started off here, by going to Maui Dog, which was closed due to an 8am burglary. Then we tried to keep the Hawaiian theme, and decided to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. But upon walking into Ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell, we quickly turned around and walked in to On the Grill.\n\nI went with the Chicken and Apple Sausage (which was a nice find because so few places will carry this). The sausage was tasty, and the condiments (lettuce, tomato, relish, etc..) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely. The Fries were good as well. Nothing over the top here, just pretty good food. No complaints from me. The staff was very friendly, and jovial. I will go back if I'm ever in the neghborhood.
4;I had the lamb dumplings which were flavorful and I would highly recommend.  Very friendly service from the staff.  And I cherished the more traditional Chinese  seaweed served as the salad.  I'll be coming back just to find this salad.
0;Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!! \n\nThat's it. \n\n-10 stars\n\n\n\nUpdate:  I guess only one person here is aloud to have an opinion. Actually I was born and raised here in Las Vegas. So the fact that you are a die hard democrat makes my opinion uneducated. No the fact that Harry Reid puts so much time and effort into trying to get Yucca Mtn. stopped instead of embracing it is where I am coming from. So because of his continued fight to stop something that is unstop-able we are now not in control. Since it is not being used as it is supposed to the Fed Gov owes some $300 million  per year for not fulfilling it's contract. ( wasting even more money ) If we had chosen to accept it we would have had the upper hand and demanded money for our roads and railways to be improved. They have spent so much money on Yucca Mtn. that there is no way it will not be used. By the way I have been there ( just before you assume to know who I am again )
0;Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1;Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.\n\nThe young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert.
3;We went to a Checkers game and had a good time. Arena was nice. Parking was adequate ($6), Security lines were swift and well organized. The staff was friendly. Concessions were par for the course (16oz bud light $6) Seating was comfy and my shoes didn't stick to floor. Jumbo tron was easily seen and the lights and and boards were all well maintained. I'm a fan. I would go to another event at this location.
0;Crappy crap.. pizza... I'm Italian.. from New york... I have had millions of slices of pizza... The pizza here is dry.. bland..plain.. and unbecoming of the name new York style pizza...\nIf you want real great pizza go to Due Forni... Now they have real pizza...\nI will never eat this pizza or come here again... \nP.s. the bartender was loud and annoying too...
2;"Meiner Ansicht nach die Apotheke unter Karlsruhes Superm\u00e4rkten, kann mir aber auch nur so vorkommen ...\n\n\n Sehr gute Lage in der N\u00e4he des Kronenplatzes, gut strukturiert und meist sehr voll. Dadurch meiner Ansicht nach viele gestresste Leute (Personal und Kunden) und dadurch nicht wirklich ein Einkaufserlebnis.\n\n\n Da es am anderen Ende der Kaiserstrasse ja jetzt einen \""bis Miternacht Rewe\"" gibt, w\u00fcrde ich mich auch hier \u00fcber diesen Service freuen. Zum einen liegt der Markt an einem Verkehrsknoten, dann noch direkt gegen\u00fcber der Uni und so voll wie es da auch sp\u00e4t Abends noch ist, w\u00fcrde eine l\u00e4ngere \u00d6ffnungszeit das ganze vielleicht entzerren.\n\n\n Mein Fazit: Zentral, nicht sonderlich g\u00fcnstig, hektisch. Muss ich nicht haben, wenn es sich vermeiden l\u00e4sst."
4;Great pizza my wife an I love the style of pizza they bring to Vegas
4;These people love what they do and it shows.  One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.\r\n\r\nHigh quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out. And the customer service! These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit. \r\n\r\nI love Artamos Deli.
1;Food just ok for me. I had a savory crepe with ham & cheese. Wasn't great. I'd like to go back & try a dessert crepe next time. Dim lighting, cool, calm & classy interior. great place for a date.
1;The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\n\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it.
4;Vraiment excellent! Cuisine raffin\u00e9e,pr\u00e9sentation soign\u00e9e et tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de ce qu'on peut manger ailleurs comme tapas. \u00c0 essayer et adopter!
1;Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food. \nI could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience. \nBasically good for booze, but not much else.
2;"I went to Angela's last Saturday for lunch, with my partner and my \""might as well be in-laws\"". I have lived within 5 minutes of Angela's for nearly 2 years now, and this was my first visit. I now know why...\n\nWe walked in, and the place was COMPLETELY deserted, at 1pm. (Their lunch service runs from 11am - 2:30, so we were pretty much smack-dab in the middle of that).  I didn't expect the place to be hopping, but also didn't expect the place to be completely devoid of customers. I didn't take it as a good sign. The lack of any other customers made for a very somber dining experience.\n\nAfter perusing their large menu, I ordered the 'Rigatoni alla Vodka'. I make a kick-ass Penne Vodka, and wanted to compare notes on a similar dish. It was good, but not great. I will say that the pasta was cooked the way I like it, al dente, which was a plus. No mushy rigatoni here. The onions in the creamy red vodka sauce were red onions, which struck me as an odd choice. I love all onions, so I was fine with it, but still - weird. All in all, it was good, but I think I would try something else next time. \n\nThe other dishes ordered were a Chicken Alfredo special of the day, Pollo alla Piccata, and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina. They brought us two twee loaves of hot bread after we ordered, with (sub-par) olive oil and balsamic for dipping. Salads do not come with the entrees during lunch or dinner service.  All of our dishes were between $8.25 - $10.\n\nOur server was nice enough, but just didn't seem to \""click\"" with us. She acted as if it was a pain for her to refill my unsweetened iced tea (the rest of the table had sweet tea), which annoyed me. \n\nWe didn't sample the wine list, unfortunately (I still can't bring myself to order a drink when the in-laws don't), so  I can't comment on that aspect. \n\nWe did look at the dessert menu, only to close it in disgust. It was strange. It was a pre-fab frozen desserts you've never heard of wonderland. No Tiramisu? No Panna Cotta? No Gelato? Very disappointing for a restaurant trying to do \""authentic Italian\"".  (Also the dessert menu was on cheapo, dirty white cardstock, with horribly dated looking photos, with \""Angela\"" on the top. Seeing as how the restaurant is called \""Angela's\"", officially, this also seemed like a big whoops).\n\nI wasn't COMPLETELY turned off, so T and I will probably go back to try the pizza and wine at some point. I hope there are some other customers then! I'm hoping the ambiance and mood would seem cheerier with other folks around."
2;If you choose this place, sit at the bar. Good place to watch sports. Menu finally revised and not so dark inside. Try it again if you were disappointed before.
1;Let's just say it how it is, steak and lobster price for happy hour portions! And the drinks........psh! Forget about it! 15 bucks a drink was wayyyyyyy too much! They better hope I am drunk if they ever expect me to pay those prices again! \n\nOur waitress was not helpful nor was she ever really acknowledging our existance and when it came time to pay she took forever to come to the table with our bill then took another maybe close to 10 minutes before she came back with our card! After our meal we were still hungry and we had to run to In-N-Out just to feel a little more satisfied!
3;Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
3;"While I normally would shy away from anything called \""Lube Chips\"", cause, you know, it's got the word \""Lube\"" in it. And imaging something like a \""Lube Chip\"" in my 7th grade-like mind just doesn't sound right.  \n\nBut they're actually good.  \n\nFor that matter, the whole restaurant is good.  Plus they have a car mounted sideways on the wall.  Seriously.  It's solidly hung too.  I checked.  It's not going anywhere.\n\nWhat I appreciate is unlike other wing-establishments of their kind, their sauce names actually line up to their heat.  If you order a medium hot sauce, it's not mild nor hot.  Their Arizona Ranch sauce is a spectacular mix of medium-ish sauce with ranch dressing.  \n\nFor entrees, I'm a fan of the wrap and my wife has actually gotten the steak a couple of times.  She was pleased.\n\nThe adult beverages are reasonably priced and a good selection too.  \n\nService has always been good for me.  \n\nNow I'm thinking I am going to go there after work.  See what writing this review has done for me?"
0;They rip you off for oil changes. Also, the guys are total salesmen. I would go somewhere else.
0;"My husband and I and another couple from out of state, who had never been to Las Vegas went to dinner @ Giada's on the night of Sept. 30. We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had made reservations a good month and a half before this date. Our time was 5pm. I am a big fan of Giada's on the Food Network, and I knew the food should be great! I thought she would never put her name on a place that wasn't going to be a wonderful place to celebrate an occasion. WRONG!!!!\n   We went to the bar while waiting for our table, 3 glasses of wine and a tip, $54. We were seated, and I requested a window seat ahead of time, but they put us at a side table where the shutters were barely open. We were given a wine menu, a food menu, then a tasting menu. We were told we all had to order the tasting menu or no one could. Confusing! We were told to order several dishes and share them family style. Our waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the sommelier, which my husband declined, because he knew of most of the bottles on the list, and which one we wanted to order. He brought the wine over, and our one friend declined to have a glass. The waiter said, \""maybe you would like a scotch instead?\"" Our friend said, \""as a matter of fact, I would\"". The waiter said, \"" I was joking\"". He brought the scotch. \n   We then ordered our food, the waiter suggested the antipasti plate. We each placed our order, then the waiter said that would not be enough food for you all, so I am going to order you a lemon spaghetti also. Aaaaaa, we did not ask for that??? In the mean time, the sommelier came over. Again, we did not ask for him. The food all came out, but took along time. Portions were small, but over all, the food was good.\n   Then things really turned. We sat for a least 15 minutes with our dirty, finished dishes in front of us. Finally, we stacked the dishes in hopes of being noticed. Someone finally came over and removed them. There was no mention of dessert to us. Our waiter came back over and asked if we wanted to see the dessert wine menu. By that time, we were ready to move on out of there. Enough! Between the bar bill and dinner bill and 2 tips we spent close to $ 500, and to top it off there was never a mention on \"" are you here for any special occasion?\""\n  We took the manager's card. I emailed him a few days later. He responded saying he was out of town and would call me in 2 days. No call came. 5 days after that, I emailed him again. He responded with, a sorry, I am out of town. I will call you tomorrow. Well, guess what?? No call !! Maybe if they had a manager who was around more, the poor service would not happen. Not worth your time and money going there."
0;"Service used to be good at REI but I have noticed it has deteriorated over that last decade (I am a member for 20+ years). It appears that they have many newbies without the experience of actually using the products. Some in customer service are just not knowledgeable enough. The other day I requested the store to hold an item for me, which they said was in stock. When I went there they did not have it and so they asked me to go to customer service and order it from a different store. The customer service lady took all me info including credit card and then told me that its a low probability you will get it from another store. But that she will call the other stores when she has the \""time\"". WTF? I bought the item cheaper from Amazon."
1;Service was good food was kind of crappy. It's kind of like IHOP with bigger portions.
0;Wow, feel sick to be charged 35 a day for a small refrigerator. Just to keep my 4 year old milk cold ? Thanks for nothing.  There are ZERO signs in the parking  garage pointing  you to check in..... hello.... you can't just assume  everyone  knows where they are going. 6 dollars for in room morning  coffee ? You guys are nutz. Really  a big mistake  coming  here.
3;I love Mediterranean food, and this is some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable.  I had the lamb kebab.  It came with Basmati rice, a Greek salad, and grilled tomatoes and onions.  I also had rice pudding for dessert.  Wow!
0;Very poor customer service not to mention out of lemonade so wife had to drink water then she asked for a sauce pack and they tried charging her . Not the 1st time here that service was horrible waited a few weeks ago for over 20 min in drive thru because they gave our shakes to someone else in the dinning room ! The rudest one was  Alex says he's manager if so I feel sorry for this store not only the way he treated us but as we were eating hearing him talk down to the employees .
1;I had ordered on the phone for my order to go. When I picked my order up it was fast. So when I got home I could not believe the small portions that was in the the bag. I had ordered the penne franco  and the Italian classics dishes. For the amount they charge it is a ripoff. My strong suggestion is to head over to Romano's Macaroni Grill. Much more worth it.
2;I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!
1;Ich fand das Essen einfach nur schrecklich. Mein Freund hatte gebratene Nudeln und ich ein paar Kostbarkeiten, alles versaltzen und nur GEschmacksverst\u00e4rker, Sosse keine Konsistenz. Die Vorspeise war schrecklich. Das waren die ekligsten Suppen und Wan-Tan die ich je gegessen habe. Die Karotten haben alt geschmeckt. So wie eben Karotten die zu lange im K\u00fchlschrank lagen schmecken. Service war freundlich, Einrichtung ist typisch Chinese wobei der Teppichboden sehr dick, staubig und modrigen Geruch im Restaurant verbreitet. Ich meckere selten beim Chinesen und bin weder verw\u00f6hnt noch unobfektiv, aber der Fast-Food Chinese ne Gasse weiter ist 1000 mal besser als dieses Restaurant!Nicht empfehlenswert. Waren zum Gl\u00fcck nur mit dem SChlemmerblock dort.
4;One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!
0;I was so excited to revisit the old Agave.  I love the outside patio. Unfortunately, it was too hot for my taste.  We were seated by the door and it was still pretty warm inside.  I did enjoy the chips and salsa.  However, my sangria was sample sized.  We order the ceviche duo with shrimp and tuna.  There might have been one or two (very small) chopped shrimp and a few bits of tuna.  Since I was so warm, I ordered the chopped salad.  It was bland.  Won't be back again.
4;Wow! During a bi-annual allergy induced laryngitis, I went in search for my favorite tea- dry desert lime. Apparently, I am the only one in PHX who knows it because no one is carrying it this year. Next best thing? Find dried limes. This quest led me to Biaz Market. The neighborhood it is in is rough, but it's more poverty than unsafe. The parking lot, though, was full. Walking in I decided to spend some time wandering the aisles. Within 30 seconds I was blown away. They have rose water and orange blossom water for 99 cents! The only place I had found it before sells it for $4! Fresh produce, cheeses, meats. Fresh herbs that I can't find elsewhere for only 89 cents! What? Am I dreaming? An entire aisle of spices- so many that I missed my limes I originally came here for. The very, very nice employee didn't just tell me what aisle, she walked me straight to it and when I commented about a ground version, she helped me search for that. Dolmas in cans and jars for under $3 (and they're freaking delicious!). Pita bread 50 cents. So much yummy stuff priced so well. We don't often get such gems of ethnicity in Phoenix, but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day. I can't wait to go back and try the restaurant, buy more groceries and test my cooking skills, and get get my fix of the world abroad without having to buts out the bones for an international flight.
4;"I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's."
0;okay...where to start.\nI drive past this spot every day, and it is always busy!  WOW!\nI'm thinking this place must be hella good Mexican to be so busy.\nI gotta try that place sometime.\n\nMy friend gave me a gift card so I went alone for a lunch/ test drive.\nI was excited! I ordered the most expensive item on the menu.\nSteak and Chicken Fajitas $14.95\nand ala carte chicken enchilada.\n\nI should have left when there was a hair in my salsa but I know shit happens and let it go back with the server.\n\nHere come my Fajitas!!  SIZZLING platter of 90% ONIONS.\n\nONIONS!!  I had to dig for the few scraps of beef jerky and boiled chicken.\nI'm not kidding. And I did make a tortilla and try it......one bite was too much. \n\nWell, at least I had my enchilada right?\nI was so bland that it couldn't have been more than boiled chicken...no seasoning at all.\n\nThe worst meal of my life.\n\nI tipped the poor server 20% figuring she had a hard enough life working there.\n\nI will never go back
3;I haven't eaten here in a while but I would highly recommend it. The past couple of years I've been approx 10 times and now it's gotten a little old hat and a few more menu items would be nice to see.\nI've had everything from the rabbit to the coffee rubbed spice filet, I don't think either one are on the current menu. I really like the squash blossoms although I wish more came on the plate :)\nI can only remember 1 time where the service was mediocre and not the usual no pressure, very polite server that is typical there.\nI can also say after taking several friends, my parents and my wife that they've all raved about Mesa afterwards if that's any help. I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend Mesa Grill to any and everyone I know.
0;"Awful!!!! Phil, the associate who cleaned my carpets told me he would have to take my large area rugs outside to wash them.... It was raining. I never had a company have to remove large area rugs to clean them so I decided to have him do the upstairs instead. When I went upstairs a few hours later, when my carpets were \""dry enough for me to walk on\"", I noticed my brand new white sapphire earrings were gone. Phil ignored my calls all night and morning and finally answered me via text message. After hours of going back and forth via text with the \""owner\"", who by the way IS Phil pretending to be someone else, they admitted to taking the jewelry and retuned it on my front porch. Crazy, I know. I have a police report number and let half off depot and groupon know of this issue. Do not use them. If they stole from me, right off my bathroom counter, what else could they have taken?! Buyer beware!!!!"
3;For a college town-exceptional choices of tequila!  Some of the bartenders can get off the high horse and be a lil more friendly. DJ keeps crowd jumping!
3;Its literally as the title says it is. If you want a little bit of everything and watch a show on a budget, this is a definite go. It was a very small show area with a smaller audience but that means a more up close and personal view of the show. Not going to complain. \n\nSeats aren't as comfy and the show is more on a casual setting, so minus 1-star. Although generally, I really enjoyed this the most for the price I paid and again, I got to see a little bit of everything. You wont be bored that's for sure.
0;Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!
2;Pretty standard issue sports bar. The place is pretty large and spread out which is nice, but we went late on a weeknight and there weren't too many people around. Seems like the kind of place a locals have been going to for years. Little dark, a little divey but not dirty or unpleasant. Beer selection wasn't great but the wings made it worth the trip. The wings were great. I live in the area and I imagine I'll be back here sometime soon.
3;I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!
3;Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?
4;"Being a bit skeptical about the concept of what I thought this place was (kinda like a Danny's Car wash plus food) , Peg and I checked it out for breakfast this am. I was so pleasantly surprised!  The full service breakfast (and Janelle could not have been more cheerful or helpful)  was legit. It's not just a \""let's order coffee and a danish at the counter\"" venue, although that is a possibility if you don't have the time to sit down. The pulled pork was good, the grit cakes were yummy (beneath a couple of nicely over easy eggs), and the coffee was at least above average. When 18 degrees blows hot and cold, and Over Easy isn't at times, this place is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  When we browsed and saw Tracy Dempsey products on the shelves...it tells you what you need to know!  Dr. B"
2;The name has changed three times and every time this place has done this, the taste has declined. Spicy chilly mint was one of my favorite dishes. Pad Thai is also no longer the same. It has become to sweet. Also They have smaller portions now.
3;My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links.
0;Could this place suck any more? I don't think so. Parking around here is horrible, but I can understand because it's in the middle of drunk skank central... and axis-radius seems to be their home base. Wasted girls who will PLOW right into you without saying excuse me... prepare to have your $5,000 freshly rhinoplastied noses broken. And if I had a dollar for every pathetic Ed Hardy-wearing, slimy jerk who tried hitting on me the 10 minutes my fiance and I were apart, I could probably retire. Drinks were ridiculously expensive. Nowhere to sit. This place is way too crowded with obnoxious, disgusting people... all just hoping to get laid. Gross.
1;I've been to other ihop locations, but this one seems to be sub par.   We were seated quickly, and the waitress was ready to take our order immediately.  Our waitress was super awkward and the service was poor. She must have asked us what we would like to order about 3 times in two minutes.  Are we not allowed to look over the menu?  I ordered the strawberry banana french toast because it looked and sounded amazing on the menu.   I was severely underwhelmed.  If sugary syrupy half frozen strawberries on thinly sliced bread is your thing, you might love it! \n\n\nWhen checking out, they were trying to tell me I needed an ID to use my visa debit card.  They hassled me for about 10 minutes over a $10 purchase. It wouldn't have been a big deal, but my ID was at home.  Visa strictly prohibits merchants to require and ID with a signed debit card, so I didnt bring it. Get it together ihop. \n\n\nI gave two stars for cleanliness, but I won't return.
0;AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!  Waitress was friendly and prompt, but after our order was put in it took over 30 min for the food to reach the table.  I ordered pineapple upside down pancakes.  I don't know how you can mess up pancakes but they did.  The pancakes were so bland and the pineapple was sour.  Terrible!  The country fried steak and gravy was good though.  Between the wait and the awful pancake experience turned me off.  I'll go elsewhere.
4;Not just the best buffet we've had in Vegas, but possibly the best buffet we've ever had. The quality of food is superb.
3;Exceptional restaurant in Charlotte and much better than a lot of the locally owned ones.  Service was outstanding, as was the food.  Here's a rundown of our order.\n\nStarters\nSteamed Littleneck Clams--These are fantastic and are bathing in a garlic/herb cream sauce that you will hang onto to sop your bread up with.  Very fresh clams and a decent portion for a starter--about 15 clams.\nRaw Oysters--I had a tasting menu of 3 varieties and found the Canadian oysters the best.  My favorite was the Beau Rivage.  Some of the oysters were very undersized and some were oversized.  It would be nice if they evened out the sizes for sharing reasons.\n\nMains\nBlackened Mahi-Mahi...the fish in the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a bit too much I felt and dominated the fish.  It was a spicy tomato sauce.  Would not order again.  The rice side was also dismal.\nSea Bass-Perfect.  This is the opposite of the mahi mahi because in this dish the fish is the star and not the sauce...although the gremolata butter is subtle and fantastic.  Sides of mash and asparagus and carrots were great.  Truly a great plate of food.\n\nDessert\nApple Upside Down Pie....fantastic.  Will disappear in less than 5 minutes guaranteed.\n\nThis is a really nice restaurant that does most things right.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.  All the ingredients are super fresh and I think I would recommend ordering something that is light on the sauce and stars the fresh seafood.
1;It's piss really. Purporting to be a burlesque / cabaret bar, the closest Siglo gets to that is a few slags wearing Ann Summers corsets and fishnets. That is pretty much the standard of the female client\u00e8le  here, and the blokes aren't much better. Generally lary, violent and pissed off their faces, you can be guaranteed to have at least an 'interesting' night. Crappy drinks and they're not too cheap either, and the staff look (unsurprisingly) like they don't want to be there.\n\nAvoid
0;The only thing you'll get outta this is a cheap as fuck hotel room right in the middle of Vegas. That is it. And that's fine if that's what you're going for. Trust me, I don't mind bumming it at all. I'll sleep where ever. And this place is basically where ever. \n\nThe first (and last) time I came here, I couldn't even find the damn room. They stuck us in the basement somewhere. We literally had to take an elevator one floor up, cross over, then take it two floors down to find our room. Definitely not a good thing to do when you're slammered. \n\nSo if you wanna do Vegas on a penny-pinching budget, and have no qualms about where you sleep, by all means, cruise on into this depressing toilet.
0;Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is
2;Ok. I had a less than positive predisposition walking in, based on last two restaurants in this space. Not fair, I know.  But...it beat my expectations. the margs were huge (albeit oddly warm when first served...the ice chilled it soon enough). Limited on tap beers, but we found something that works. The chips were stale, salsa was good. The lobster enchiladas (3 of them, the special) were good, as was the lobster quesadilla (with side of guacamole). Portions were large and tasty. The blackbeans served on the side could use a bit more seasoning, but they're not the showcase of the meal anyway. Good neighborhood joint...& this 'hood needs another one! We'll try again!
4;Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here.
4;Early on a hot Saturday morning, we headed to Baker Nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure. What a lovely nursery! It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down. All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful. My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants. We had so many questions, and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant, what kind of soil, sunlight and water it needed, etc. I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house, but I didn't know it's name, so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it.  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about, pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch. We loved the personal attention, and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car.  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving! Whether you're a seasoned gardener or newbie to the plant world, your time won't be wasted at Baker Nursery, and you'll get the best of the best in terms of plants and service!
2;"Good luck finding the place on the first try as there is no signage showing where they are. The parking lot is not lit at night so it is extremely dark; would be nice if they had a take out parking space by the entrance. One night I came in to pick up a pizza and had a hard time pulling in as there were some guys at the lot entrance throwing a football around...they stared at me weird as I drove past them.\nPizzas and calzones are good. Thought the side Caesar salad (take out) was pricey at $4.\nFor takeout once in a while it's ok."
4;This place is delicious. You pick your choice of meat (chicken, steak, ground beef, pork and others) they place it in a corn tortilla for you and the rest is up to you. They have many choices at the salsa bar. You can go mild or very hot. All tacos are $2.50 each. They take cash or you can go inside the store and pay with a credit card.
3;I'd never eaten sushi before, and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced. I got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu. My more experianced sushi friends raved about it to.
3;This is an awesome facility with great staff and plenty of cool stuff to look at.  The range itself is clean and has nice electronic target distance adjusters.  Rico one of their staff members took a bit of extra time to help me with my grip and give me a few shooting pointers which helped a ton.  The only ding I give this place is the fact they make you buy their targets.  Definitely check them out if you want a great range experience.
3;Went here with the husband and our 2 teens and we all get something different so we could share. Everyone enjoyed their smoothie and the employees here were very friendly. \n\nI just wish these dang things were a little less pricey...and i would eat em more often, they are like having a meal.
2;"It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \""Best lunch in town!\"" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \""Yes, i think I will\"". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again."
0;"We arrived a little after 3pm with a group of 20, including 16 with Special Needs.  No line, plenty of empty tables and we gave our Groupons and had to pay $2.49 per person extra ( tax?).  They wanted us to pay $100 for gratuity to sit together in the same EMPTY area; another union rule.   More later on that.  I said no problem, we aren't moving since we were already seated, but told them they just lost any additional tip we were planning on leaving above the $100.  This is union policy, I was told again.  Well, keep your union policies.   Those are the workers the union protects..  Good for the union.  The service was awful, the food was just as bad and I would never recommend this place to anybody who has any food taste/class.   As soon as we finished, I had two vomit ( un- sweetened tea must have been off temperature).   None of us ate more than a bit of anything.  Most items weren't labeled so the one with a seafood allergy, ended up with seafood in the pasta.   Not labeled.   Chicken Noodle Soup isn't a selection of soup.  It was the only choice.   Desserts were just awful.   The best was the Ice Cream and it can from a machine.   Don't go,  not recommended; rather stay hungry than eat this rubbish.  Service was terrible, but then again, unions only hire the best workers...wrong...least motivated.... yes!   Fool me once...Never again."
1;Meh. I've experienced better for sure than Wet Republic.\n\nGranted, we did come early about 11am because the first # of girls get in free but damn, it wasn't poppin and even the music wasn't poppin.\n\nWe really couldn't do much except sit by the pool on their towels and put our feet in the water. No one was in the pool and we're all waiting for someone to get the party started.\n\nThe weather that day was bad since it was a predicted thunderstorm and the dayclub security told us to take our feet out of the water for 30 minutes because of the lightning that struck in the pool next door as well as being picky about moving our towels to make space for a walkway :(\n\nIt was getting irritating how strict it was here and there wasn't even a crazy party going on.\n\nI wouldn't come here again, unless it was 2pm and we had a speedy entrance. AND free dranks.
1;"Like several others on this site, it is possible that our experience here could be chalked up to a \""bad night\"", but this is my third time to Mesa (2 others for lunch) and I have yet to have a memorable meal here. Our night started with a 30 minute wait for our table (yes we had a reservation) and were given all sorts of attitude from the hosts. We ordered cocktails after being seated, signature Margarita's for a few  and everyone who did, myself included stated how \""sweet\"" they were. Missing that sour balance and very disappointing. Appetizers we fine, nothing special. When the main courses were delivered, two (of 6) went back for being under cooked. I really can;t express how disappointed we were. With all the great places popping up in Vegas, it seems that Mesa is riding on it's past reputation and not what got it to the dance."
3;Awesome! I'm here for business and planned on trying someplace new every day...I had Thai House for lunch and I'm tempted to go back for dinner.\n\nShrimp & chicken pad Thai, level 3 spiciness add pineapples! Service was quick. Food flavor robust.
4;One place that I love coming to is this place. I know I can depend on this place for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was flying out of Phoenix and I desperately needed food before I dealt with TSA, and flying. I ended up buying the power protein sandwich which was a very reasonable price. $5 in an airport for a good sandwich. I'm down!!\n\nAnyways they took my order and it took about five minutes to make my sandwich. The power sandwich had whole grain bread,  egg whites, white Vermont cheddar and lean ham. The ham and egg tasted so good. And the bread was very hearty and delicious. It made eating healthy be delicious. I really enjoyed my sandwich and it kept me full until lunch time!!
4;Service and food is as good as it gets in a steakhouse. Pricing for Wagyu steak is fair, $90 for a 32 oz piece that two could share. Crabcake with Cajun sauce was delicious, but only one crabcake in the appetizer portion. The bread was nothing to write home about. The steak was the star of the evening, perfectly seasoned and prepared. We were licking the bone! They had prisoner by the glass, one of our favorite wines. Perhaps next time I would order the rib eye bone-in steak because the Wagyu, though melt-in-the-mouth tender, had too much fat for my liking.
4;"The search for the elusive cookie butter is what originally led us here.\n\nI am a HUGE Trader Joe's fan/addict, and anytime we make it to California or Las Vegas, this always ends up being one of our first stops on our trips.\n\nFaves here include:\n\n-crunchy cookie butter\n-cookie butter bar\n-speculoos cookies (notice a theme? lol)\n-sea salted chocolate caramels\n-dark chocolate almond laceys\n-dark chocolate edamame\n-cinnamon pita chips\n-beurre meuni\u00e8re popcorn (lemon, thyme, brown butter)\n-cold brew coffee\n-gingerbread coffee (seasonal :( boo)\n\nA tip for Hawaii locals trying to get their hands on cookie butter: you need to go to the farthest Trader Joe's from the strip/downtown area, and get there early (preferably as soon as they open). \n\nLooking forward to our next Vegas trip... I already have my Trader Joe's shopping list ready. ;P"
0;- Very inconvenient location, its like in a basement area, really is a shitty location\n\n-In order to sit down and watch sports you need minimum $50 order PER PERSON,  EVERYDAY ALL DAY\n\n-Cashiers were assholes to me\n\n-Worst Sportsbook I've been to in Vegas.
0;Terrible customer service (if you can even call it customer service)  From start to finish it was bad.... The pro shop being the worst. Followed by the sprinkles running with no one to shut them off on at least half the holes. Take your money elsewhere. ..To many other courses to play with much more customer oriented staff....
1;I brought a thumb drive to this location when I found a little piece of plastic stuck in the USB connection after getting it from a client.   I was adverse to contacting the client to get another copy of a workable drive however felt I could save them time by resolving the issue myself.    The geek Squad rep took the drive to the back, spent all of 90 seconds to resolve the issue (pulled out the plastic) came back out and said the fix was on him.   Promptly, a manager told him that anytime their time was utilized it would necessitate at least a 30.00 dollar charge as that was their minimum.   I ended up paying the minimum regardless of what the first guy told me, but left with a bad taste in my mouth over the whole thing.   This review would have been 5 stars and they would have had my business for life but for the stupid policy.   \nGeek Boutique (via amazon) here I come!
0;Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.
0;Seems a little small and cramped.  Location is ok, prices cheap.  Salesmen have a weird vibe- you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service.
4;As suggested, we tried the Cal Italia.  It truly was worth all the recommendations.  Absolutely loved the pizza and the appetizer meatballs were the perfect compliment.  Cool atmosphere, great location downtown, accommodating service and food very much worth coming back for.  Which we will be doing soon!
3;"So simple. So good. Why can't every city just have a Cosi by now?  Or at least Milwaukee; that'd be perfect.  Having been here a couple of times now, I consider myself a fan.  Between the pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan pesto chicken sandwich, Cosi offers tasty options for fast but warm meals without tasting cheap or unhealthy.  Me gusta."

4;yummmmm.. hot and toasty
2;This location used to be one of my favorite comedy clubs in town (back when the LA Comedy Club called Palace Station home) but it has gone downhill the past few times I have come. The comedians are usually pretty unknown and it's usually a crapshoot on whether they'll actually be funny or not. \n\nOur last trip there was on Saturday for friend's birthday. The comedians were sub-par on this occasion unfortunately. \n\nOn many occasions there will be very good comedians and I am looking forward to a better-known comedian that will be there this week that we already have tickets for, but for the most part there is a 50/50 chance that you will laugh, which is pretty good considering you often get free or discounted tickets to this place if you are a local.
1;Had key lime & maple bacon bar. Both were good but not great. 4 choices for coffee, 3 were empty so had to get the only choice. It is Sunday afternoon so will give them one more try on a morning.
2;I'm giving this restaurant three stars because no matter what happens here I've always enjoyed their burgers. So... the first time my wife & I ate here was when they opened in this location. It wasn't a good experience but the food was good. Fast forward to the future. Picture if you will, a couple driving around at 8pm confused as to where to eat, Red Robin beckons with its faux diner lights. We enter the restaurant & its nearly empty. We both look at one another with a wtf look on our faces. Eight pm and there's no one in the bar & the restaurant is nearly empty, what gives? No one seemed to know. Our hostess took us to a table that had an empty bottle of ketchup and no tableware. We didn't notice that fact till we needed napkins.\n\nI ordered a black Russian. What arrived was a black martini? WTF? That drink was sent back and eventually the black Russian appeared. I had to nurse it though. It was a very small drink. :( We ordered guacamole, salsa & chips as an appetizer. It had a couple very large homemade chips, some regular sized chips & two chip baskets that held the guacamole & salsa respectively. Cute idea but neither chip cup held enough of either. However it was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders & I had a Chophouse Burger. The burger was very good. I really appreciate Red Robin's wrappers around the burgers. They really make eating burgers a pleasure.  \n\nOur server's name was Matt. A nice & polite young man. Should we dine there again we'll ask for him.
3;This place is great for large groups & their happy hour! The separate room for teppanyaki is nice & the food tastes great. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth it!
0;The graffiti etched elevators should be your first clue this place is low rent scuzzy.\n\nThe whole place felt slimy and like any ordinary shopping mall in decline - definitely not worth visiting in a place like Vegas with so many better options.\n\nI agree with other reviewer, the place smelled like bathroom throughout.
3;"This restaurant is one of those strip mall hole-in-the-wall types.  It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.\n\nWe hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.\n\nTheir lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.\n\nThe food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.\n\nTheir sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nThey provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!\n\nPS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)"
0;When.she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes I should have hung up the phone! by the time I got it home it was rubbery. (Is that a word?) Anyway, Yuck! We won't be back.
4;2012, I travelled to Vegas to meet a darling old friend and he took me to CUT Steakhouse. Since then, I have compared every steakhouse to this location and no meat melts in my mouth as that night. The salad, appetizer, mashed potatoes and the STEAK was to die for.. I've been exposed to quality and now, I can't compare any other steakhouse to this place. My #1 Favorite Steakhouse of all time! Oh and service was spectacular unless my friend's presence as being a regular customer and a known face may have added to some favoritism. Either way, 5 stars was well deserved.
0;"Customer service is horrid!  After this experience I truly wonder if my private medical records are safe in a place with these types of people!  \nI walked in the door at 8:15 am to avoid an extensive wait as I do understand how busy medical facilities can get.  My first impression was the scowling front desk ladies a chubby one with long blonde hair and the other an older woman, so I proceeded to sign in and take a seat as they said to. \nAfter waiting one hour I was called up to the desk to register and asked to have a seat again, then another hour passed by before being called back into triage. Along my complete 2 hour wait in the waiting area I heard the front desk ladies going on and on gossiping and laughing loudly (not medically professional or acceptable) about other employees and patients as well talking about how a certain patient was so annoying and such, I was appalled by their language and the things they were saying but I really needed to be seen so I continued to wait.  \nAfter I was eventually taken to a room the Doc came in viewed me very briefly and left me to sit yet another 45 min while the incompetent medical assistant dipped my urine for 45 min (i guess she was playing with the pee haha it takes 60 seconds to dip and analyze a urine strip).  I waited and waited and waited ever so patiently after all I had already experienced to this point.... It was finally time to go yay!!!  That evening I received a voicemail to call back about my results, when I did so no one even asked my name before she harshly said \""thats just our customer service call\"" I couldn't get her to transfer me back to the nurse that left me a message because I didnt know the nurses name so I decided that instead of arguing with the receptionist I would just  try to call again in the morning... SO in the morning I called to try to get ahold of a nurse for my results and Latoya answered, wow she really  put the icing on the cake!!!!  She was very unpleasant to talk to, her tone was very rude as if I had ruined her day by calling, she was very aggressive over the phone and huffed and puffed into the phone because she was so annoyed that I wanted to talk to a nurse for my results, she talked to me with repulsion in her voice and  Finally she said she would get a message over for someone to call me back, they did call back at 4:30 that evening, the nurse that called was even more incompetent that the first one, this girl couldn't even read me my results!  She stumbled over the words and gave me no clear answer, I finally throw my hands in the air and give up!!  I guess ill just go somewhere else if my problem continues because there is NO WAY IN HELL Id go back to this place!  Waste of time, money and I am disgusted with their non existent  \""customer service and medical professional skills\"""
4;Dr. Berschler is the best!  Signed up for a dental plan (HM0) but found out Dr. Berschler was not on the plan and was very disappointed. Went to a dentist on the plan but had a lot of problems with the office and now I'm back! I can't say enough about Downtown Phoenix Dental.  Everyone is top knotch and I'm sorry I even considered a change. I'm recommending this office to all my friends.
3;I am still a big fan of Miko's.  The only advice I would give is that do not go there when they are packed and you are hungry.  We went there on a fairly busy night.  All the tables were taken so we waited about 15 minutes for a table to open up.  When we finally got seated, it took a while to get our drink order and then quite a while until we got our items ordered.  After placing our order, it took about 30 minutes to be served.  They were not complicated items.  I ordered their Vegetarian Yakisoba and my partner ordered a vegetarian sushi roll.  My dish came out first and the veggie roll took another 10 minutes to get there.  I don't know what the hold up was considering most people were not having sushi and we placed the order 30 minutes ago.  My partner was a bit disconcerted because  we loved their veggie rolls before.  This was not up to par from our previous experience.  My yakisoba was awesome.  As I said we are still a big fan of Miko's.  They just need to streamline their service when they are packed.
1;It's a nice place to sit and relax and chat with friends and all before the security area since it's a restaurant in an airport, but the food didn't impress me.\n\nI ordered the ahi tuna burger and the ahi tuna patty was bland and a little overcooked. The bun itself wasnt that toasty either. The fries were pretty decent though.\n\nI probably should order something else next time. My friend's ahi tuna taco platter looked pretty good (but is also almost $10 more)
3;All you can eat sushi?  Oh yes!\nHawaiian style grinds?  Oh Yes!\n\nThis is a must go to place for anyone from hawaii. The AYCE sushi is fantastic, but it does have a timelimit and they are supposedly strict with leaving leftovers (we did not).\n\nAlso comes with a dessert.  \n\nYou want malasadas?  they have them here too!
3;The food is very good and the atmosphere is great.
1;"I went to the Zoe's in Raleigh and it was fabulous! Pretty fast, just a lovely experience. \n\nHowever, my sister and I have gotten takeout on several occasions from this Zoe's and the service has been TERRIBLE. We've ordered in advance, told it will take 15 mins or so, show up and are told it will take a different amount of time. All in all, the last time we ordered takeout, my sister ended up waiting an hour total, at least 40 mins of which was spent in the restaurant. WHAT! I just dont understand that type of service for lunch takeout! What is the delay? The DNC isn't here yet, we called ahead, she took her time to drive there and she still spent MORE THAN HER LUNCH BREAK waiting on the food to be prepared! So disappointing.\n\nThis treatment is unacceptable. It is not my fault I was told one thing, showed up and then told another thing (wait longer). They could have told me from the beginning, \""this will take 1 hour to prepare,\"" and I would have shown up an hour later. COME ON!!!\n\nNOT ONLY THIS! She called to speak to the manager and some girl lied to her saying she was the manager on the phone when she knows from being in the restaurant the manager is a guy (the same girl told her so). The fake girl manager hung up on her when she asked to speak to the real manager. (Um?) Terrible terrible service. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? \n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was cold. :-( SMH."
0;Lacking in customer service, unhappy employees unable to hide bad attitudes, and minimal service provided to qualify as a mani-pedi.  \n\nPurchased a special on Living Social for my wife. First scheduled appointment was never recorded and she wasted a trip. Second appointment canceled due to broken A/C. Third appointment met with staff lacking in customer service skill, unpleasant personalities, and bad attitude. The special offered full mani-pedi regularly $85 for 53% savings. Service provided was the absolute minimum to qualify in either mani or pedi category. \n\nThey don't deserve repeat business, which is probably why they were on Living Social.
2;Make it a 3 plus, actually.  I had a Cuban sandwich (roast pork, ham, swiss cheese and pickles on a roll) and a mamey milkshake.  The sandwich tasted homemade--like something my grandmother might have made (even though she was English, not Cuban), with tender, well-done roast pork.  The mamey shake was a little bland, but never having had mamey before, I had to try it.  I assume that's the way mamey is, and it was soothing and cooling, so the bland wasn't a total negative.  Think sort of an apricot-peach-tropical shake that is meant to be good for you, and you have an idea how it tastes.  Service was fine, but I was the only customer in the place.  I'd try this place a second time when I have a bigger appetite.
3;The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome.
2;If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.
0;"Golden Nugget deserves 1 star when you have to pull a couch cushion off of the sofa to put in the bathroom to get some peace and quiet sleep.  I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  \n\nI was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?\n\nCustomer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere \""well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps\"" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that \""he would not\"" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were \""I will not do that for you.\""  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a \""never event.\""  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  \n\nMy 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  \n\nThanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was \""a great idea\"" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package."
3;Best beds ever... the room may have been a little small for my liking, but I could curl up and die with one of the pillows or blankets. Bartenders know what they're doing, but seem a little rushed some of the time, and some of the prices are a wee bit steep.\nAlways can find a good time somewhere in HRH..
0;No. I don't think so.\n\nI'm in the service industry. I get out of work and want to have a drink. This means I'm going to be arriving at your bar later in the evening. \n\nWe walked in at around 11. We ordered two glasses of wine, paid for them and plopped down on a couch to relax. At exactly 12 on the dot, they turned off the music and turned up the lights. One manager came over to ask if we were finished. I looked at my 1/4 filled glass and said No.\n\nAnother bartender comes over and asks if we were finished. Still no. But he chose to stand there and watch us while we finished the last few sips.\n\nAside from the weird ambiance (is it a lounge? A bar? A sports bar?) the way were treated was beyond rude and unacceptable. \n\nI will never return and I will tell everyone I know not to come here. You do not treat people (especially ones who work in the same industry) this way and not expect a backlash.

2;When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!
3;I really hate to give any Starbucks lower than 5 stars but this gets a 4 for the high prices and the fact that they gave the person in line in front of me a discount because he was staying at the hotel. Also I am ultra sensitive to the taste of soy or bad milk for that matter, and my grande caramel macchiato, that I drink daily, was slightly off. \n\nHowever, my hubby's whole milk vanilla latte was perfect, and this is probably one of the best places to people watch (and I don't mean facing out to the pool, although you might enjoy that too).\n\nThere are so many Starbucks near here, I think this will be my last time at this one unless I find myself in need of a quick fix.
2;One of my oldest bookmarks...finally checked!\n\nIt was a very busy Saturday afternoon...and there was a considerable wait.  Parking was a little difficult as well...busy shopping area.\n\nI was quite a bit bummed out that they don't serve the LUNCH menu on the weekends...only the BRUNCH menu at any time of the day.  Really wanted to give the burger a spin :(\n\nSo instead, I went with the New Mexican-style Slow-Cooked Pork ($12): Simmered in New Mexican Red Chile, Over-Easy Eggs and Rice. They warn it's spicy, but I didn't find it very spicy at all. It was super tender though, and had lots of flavor! I enjoyed it :)\n\nAlso tried the DW Nicoise ($16): Pan-seared Tuna, Olives, Haricot Verts, Fingerling Potatoes, Heirloom Tomatoes, Sliced Egg, Fresh Mango & Dijon Champagne Vinaigrette. Good overall, but it wasn't outstanding.  I don't think I would recommend it.\n\nPrices were ok and portions were good.  I guess I just wasn't overly impressed enough for the bump in review.  Might have been too hyped up for me personally.\n\nPics:
3;we are huge fans of their reverse happy hour on sundays. we get great service and are out of there before the uppity crowd arrives for some fool-snobbery. ra is a great sushi staple in the valley.
0;went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.
0;Food prepared wrong. Charged for things that we supposed to be complimentary as per our waitress, including entrees and deserts. Not going back to this place!! Manager said she would fix things but didn't.
1;"Jerry's...  Ugh!  I try to like you since we live so close to each other but...  Ugh!\nI have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...\nI use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. \n\""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...\""   \nI can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  \n\nThe clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.\nThey do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.\nI spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   \""No clue.\"" \nJerry's, just clean it up and have your people act toward you and your customers with the same passion they have with their own art.  Do this and I will try to like you again."
3;get the ngocchi and that is all I have to say.... do it before you die.   The stuff melts in your mouth and I have never had it taste so good anywhere else.  The food and service are great at this place and the prices are like a really high end restaurant.  This place has been around since the 70's and it shows...which is my only complaint.  I really wish they would remodel this place and revive it a little bit because the food is really good.  The owner is always around our server has worked there for 33 years if that doesn't tell you something.  The atmosphere in the bar is black and white checkerboard tile with mirrors for walls.  The dining room has been painted but the furniture is a little dated.  I ordered the veal Marsala and it was fantastic, my wife got the salmon and it was even better.  I wish this place was closer to home I would come more often.
1;I was excited to try the food after watching a show on tv .. I tried the the Enchiladas suizas, good at first but, Chicken was hard, so much cream and cheese got tortillas soggy so much onions, should of called it Onion Enchiladas.The vegetable were ok the salad was good. My wife got the shrimp tacos kinda pricey for three tacos almost $4 a taco one shrimp and lots of cabbage the only thing that gave it flavor was the suace. I skipped the dessert . I could of ate at home save the drive and $$. First time and last ... Don't get me wrong , we were expecting an awesome flavor , but it didn't ..
2;Gigantic tourist trap, but I suppose it's fun for the kids. Pretty much M&M logos plastered on every item imaginable, but the wall of M&Ms is pretty impressive. If you only want a few candies, get them somewhere else, as waiting in the lines to check out can take a while, and $12.99/lb for M&Ms isn't a great deal. Good to go to at least once, I suppose.
1;** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **\n\nI really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.\n\nUpon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. \n\nIn the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  \n\nBack to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.\n\nOur waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth.
2;Mike L 1/1/11 review is spot on.  Broth is clear, but pho was a bit meager at especially $7.99 bowl prices (or even std cheaper Phoenix pricing).\n\nI don't think a bathroom really exists for customers, so wee or pee boys and girls before you come.
3;One of the best customer service experiences I had during my search for a bridal gown. The ladies there were super helpful and accommodating. Same day appointments are available during the week but there is usually 1-2 week wait for a Saturday appointment. The store carries Essence of Australia and Enzoani gowns. They were all beautiful but the selections were limited (minus 1 star).
2;Expensive. They told us that if one person of our party of six didn't come by ten minutes after our reservation, we would lose our reservation. It was stupid because he told us what he wanted to order too! I don't really understand why we couldn't be seated? Anyways, he made it so we got seated outside.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting seated outside. It was super nice and relaxing rather than the really fancy place inside... My friend and I split the sea bass, which was a special and it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it and it was over $30.\n\nI DEFINITELY would recommend the french onion soup. That is why I am giving this place a 3 star WITH the view from outdoors and the ability to people watch (I mean it is Vegas after all....)
4;Love this place! Was referred by a friend. I am very particular about my nails and have finally found a place where I leave 100% happy. Very clean and fun atmosphere with tons of colors to chose from. The nail techs are all very talented and friendly.
2;We stayed at TI for our 4th and final night in Vegas this past trip. We had stayed there for a few days last year and really loved it. However, with the changes in ownership and associated issues with that, the only thing that remained consistent about our stay here was the incredible bed. I swear it makes me want to lounge in bed all day! \nThe new owners kicked out my favorite restaurant (Social House) as well as changing several other restaurants and the spa. Check in took over an hour, which is ridiculous. Slots were outdated. The poker room is decent, and they have 4 $50 tournys a day.
3;I think this is one and only Indo-chinese restaurant in Phoenix area. Nice and clean place. Food was really good. We went on a Thu with reservation and was not crowded. \n\nTry the Manchurian Chicken ... Tasty
0;I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food.
0;Terrible. Tried the bulgogi sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a mocha frap - none of it was good and it was as expensive as the awesome deli dinner I has the night before.
0;First off I'm Puerto Rican! I was not impressed with the food here at all. The flavor was lacking and so was the gravy. Who wants to eat dry rice and chicken! Sorry, just keepin it real. If your looking for friendly service then by all means eat here. The owner is sweet. I didn't finish my food. So after attempting to eating here I went home and cooked real PR food..yum. Gosh I miss the East Coast! Umm I won't be back.
3;The steak here was spectacular. I have to say that my NY was the best steak I have ever eaten. The sauce on it was light, a bit sticky and fantastic. The asparagus was in a sauce that was delightful. I have never tasted anything this good. The fries were excellent as well. The only downside here was the terrible service. Our waiter really tried hard. But it was obvious he had no training. There was no decorum or politeness to it. He did not remember who had ordered what. When the food came he was holding up plates asking who had what. Ugh. What has happened to fine dining. I must say that all restaurants at The Palms have good food and bad service actually. Except for Simon. How about a food server training Maloofs?
0;"I'm going to agree with my friend, Shawn J.\n\nI am old enough to remember when Thirty Ice Cream was located in the now defunct Thrifty Drug Stores. It was a \""loss leader\"" charging 5 cents for a single, 10 cents, for a double, and 15 Cents for a tripple. \n\nThe quality was really low back then, but so were the prices. \n\nNow, I did not expect to find the same prices, but for the poor quality, I did expect it to be less then 31 Flavors, and Cold Stone. Not the case.\n\nThis Ice Cream is not in the same class with Ben & Jerry's, Hagen Daz, 31 Flavors, or even the Bryer's you get at the store. The scoops are generous, but the low quality does not justify their prices.\n\nMy wife and I shared a double waffle cone of Coffee and Strawberry Ice Cream. A real waste of \""cheat\"" calories on my diet.  \n\nMy suggestion; go up or down the street to Albertson's or Von's, spend $4 on a pint of B&Js, Hagen Daz, or something you really like, and go home and enjoy it.  Your taste buds and your wallet will both thank you."
3;"I have enjoyed my services at this spa. The place is small, but cozy and welcoming. The staff seems knowledgable. I have had a couple massages here, a body scrub and a couple facials done as well and I have felt very happy with all of them. My facials were especially good. The girls are really sweet and helpful and adress any skin concerns you have. They are also reasonably priced, even if you are a \""non member\"" which I am not. They have a small rest area where you are picked up before your treatment. They serve snacks and beverages and you can read magazines while waiting and in between treatments. They have a sauna also which I don't use (not my thing). Showers, lockers, slippers and all that. Cute little spa and I would recommend."
0;I went to have dinner there and the service was not great at all, it took them 20 minutes to finally acknowledge I was there and asked if I wanted a menu. I ordered sliders and a drink, it had nothing special to it, the food is less than average. I would rather go to BJs down the street on Decatur than bother going there again. Waste of time, waste of money.
1;I really wanted to love this place. My husband and I have always talked about eating here... One night we decided to give it a shot. Our server was definitely not friendly to start... Passion fruit mojitos were super weak, pretty much ice water ...some of our dishes took 45 mins to the table.... Way longer than it should have, even for tapas. Best thing we ordered were the sliders... Empanadas were good as well. I would seriously advise against the baked cod.. Way over seasoned with chili flakes, perhaps to hide the unfreshness of the fish, yucky. Over all it wasn't worth the $75 spent...and we won't be back.
4;Allure is awesome! The salon is always clean, the staff is friendly, and their prices are reasonable. I live about 15 miles from Allure, but make the drive there whenever I want my nails done or need a wax because nobody else does as good of a job as Allure. Get your eyebrows waxed by Jen! I've been going to her for 2 years and she's the only person I trust with my brows. She does a great job, keeps them full & natural looking, but cleans them up nicely.\n\nAlso: Bring cash to tip because you can't write in a tip on your credit card receipt!
3;If you are even remotely a Motown fan, check out this show. They will have you tapping your fingers and dancing your feet in no time. We LOVED it. I bought two VIP tickets to this show through goldstar.com. My wife and I like Motown music, having both been children who grew up with parents/relatives who listened to this type of music. Smokey Robinson did an awesome job by picking these guys. The musicians were great, the choreography was excellent and the singers are superb. Highly reccomend this show!! \n\nVisited April 2011
0;The restaurant here is horrible. The food is okay, nothing special but not awful. However, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. I went with a group of coworkers and the waiter repeatedly screwed up. He forgot our orders and had to come back and ask, brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree, and to top it off, he charged us for more food than we actually ordered. Luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake. We talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really didn't make up for the horrible service but at least it was something. I do not recommend this place for food
0;Overpriced, mostly just rice and beans. Salsa was watered down. My first time at this location and it will be my last. Bussers run there ass off and servers seem to do nothing. Took forever for are food to get there and when it did it was cold. When I complained to the manager he barely spoke English. Anyways if you looking for great Mexican food look elsewhere.
0;"My family was in town the first weekend in November for my nephew's university graduation. We chose Claim Jumper as our one special celebration meal together (there were 15 of us). It was so disappointing.\n\nWe had been driving all day and the kids were starving. Our waiter was slow, impatient, and incompetent. He rolled his eyes at us several times. He spent too much time trying to pressure us into buying some card for regulars even though we don't even have Claim Jumpers in our state.\n\nHe messed up over half the orders. For instance, my nephew's wife never got part of her meal, and the kids never got their drinks. My nephew asked for no onions and got onions. He forgot to ask what side I wanted, and blamed it on me 20 minutes later: \""You didn't tell me what you wanted.\"" He didn't give me a chance. 20 more minutes after that, he informed me that they were out of what I ordered and shoved a menu at me. I chose the chili in a bread bowl that he highly recommended, and got chili without a bread bowl. My sister-in-law barely touched her food because it wasn't good. We are not a picky group! By then we were starving and even though we were right by his POS station, we rarely saw him and couldn't get his attention, so we made do with what we got. The chili he highly recommended tasted like canned Nalley chili with some chunks of meat thrown in.\n\nThen he couldn't split our check, even though we told him at the beginning that we would have separate checks. He was huffy and impatient as we told him again who was together, and since we'd been there so long my brother finally told him we'd work it out on our own. He rudely said, \""Good, because see what I'm dealing with?\"" and showed us some crazy chicken scratch diagram he made. He was clearly not trained or qualified or something when it came to serving a big group. \n\nWhen we analyzed the check, I saw that he had charged us for my original meal that they were out of, plus the one I ordered to replace it (which wasn't right either, but I ate it). It took at least 15 minutes to find him and bring it to his attention, and then he was huffy and abrupt about it. I got a half-apology but no offer to make it up to us in any way. We contemplated going to the manager but we were exhausted and just wanted to go to our hotel.\n\nI hope that was an unusual experience, because I honestly have never had such rude and incompetent service in my life. I know that food service is hard work and I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, but there was no excuse for his sloppy waiting and especially his rude attitude. \n\nThankfully, my nephew took me afterward to the other side of town to get the best street taco I've ever had. :) Next time I visit him in Vegas, I'll definitely avoid Claim Jumper."
0;"Woke up this morning to a message on yelp (which I've never gotten) from Samantha A who told me: \""I am a customer at caffe bene and its great to have this unique cafe in urbana, since it just opened, the staffs might not be fully trained  and  probably still in the training process. I just want to say that your message just make me want to throw up, your a retard I hope you will never come back to caffe bene again.\""\nDid I just receive internet hate? Also, people feel this strongly about this place? The drinks I ordered wanted to make me throw up, which may explain why my review was vomit-inducing. It doesn't take much training to mix in the powder into the liquid. The drinks we got when I was there was half powder floating on top of the ice and milk. \nI will admit that I haven't been back since I was there last time but since then I haven't heard anything good about the place. Giving it another one star rating in place of a friend who went and was terribly disappointed. Don't expect decent coffee here. Paradiso is just a block away, go there instead."
2;Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.
1;"Ok everyone... So I was really betting (n.p.i.) on this place to be good. And I've got to say, Yelp's never steered me this wrong before. My wife and I came to Vegas to celebrate our 1st anniversary. I took her here on a saturday afternoon. Not packed. \n\nNice ambience inside, as others had described. The waitress was kind and very attentive. One and two stars there. \n\nAfter that, it was all downhill. Since we went there during their \""specials\"" hour (4:30-6 on Sat) we ordered off their deal menu. Not really exciting prices; they were between 4.50 to 9 bucks. Where we live, that's usually normal price. Minus 1 star. \n\n We ordered california, tiger,(both $8) spicy tuna, and another simple roll (both $4.50). Taste: between a \""ehh\"" and \""this stinks\"". Minus another star. \n\nThe last star was removed because this place was just not that great. I'm hoping we just had a new sushi chef who couldn't really make good sushi; or maybe we're just spoiled in LA. But really, I was dissapointed. If this is the best you've got in Vegas, then I'm surprised. I'll really just come here for the gambling and nice hotels."
2;This place is no secret, it's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, just look for a long dark hallway lined with picture frames of random shit. The line for this place was nearly out the door when I came on Christmas Day, which was also my very 1st visit here. I can see why the lines are so long...because it's the only affordable place to eat inside the Cosmo! The pizza itself is decent depending on what you get. I got 2 slices: pepperoni and sausage/banana pepper. The pepperoni one was alright...I've definitely had better at cheaper price points. the sausage and banana pepper one was pretty damn good though and it was a good combo together. I'd come back for that one.\n\nSlices range around the price of 5 bucks each depending on what kind you get. Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6. Whole pies are around $26-30 and may be a cheaper option if you're wanting more than 4 slices. Drink selection is sparse here, and bottled beer is 8 bucks! I guess it is the Strip though...They had a water cooler there but it was broken. Thanks for putting a sign on there to let us know because a few customers and I tried messing with it and wondered why nothing would dispense. \n\nI would come back here but only if I were already near the Cosmo. It's definitely not worth the drive down. I'd much rather drive to Metro Pizza or Costco for cheaper and more tasty pies.
3;Gave Kabuki happy hour a whirl on a Monday afternoon.  We were very pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe staff was all very attractive and very nice.  \n\nThe happy hour options are great!  Loads of choices.  The sake sangria and lychee martini were quite tasty but will sneak up on you! Yikes!   \n\nIt is very nice that the happy hour menu is offered in the entire restaurant.  You don't have to worry about cramming into a tiny bar or lounge space.  We were seated at a nice table just like any other diner.  \n\nKabuki is very nice inside and the food presentation was flawless.  Just about everything we ordered was a win!   The only miss I recall was the tofu appetizer.  Bland and boring.  The fried mozzarella wrapped in seaweed were clever and tasty!\n\nI'll definitely return and you should go check it out!
3;Surprisingly really good. I liked the nachos I got the most and it all tasted fresh and it was made relatively quick. Excellent service as well. I had a hard time deciding but they were patient with me
4;We bought a Boston Terrier puppy from the Puppy Boutique a year ago. The owner was very helpful. We played with many dogs and stayed there a while. The owner and staff was very friendly. The also gave a military discount! Our puppy has never been ill and is of good breeding! I would go back ( if I could afford it!)
3;"I\""ve seen this place gone though many name and owner changes.  It's called \""Go Wild\"" now and they are offering the 50% off sushi rolls 24/7.  Before you get too excited, I gotta say the rushi rolls on the 50% off menu are about $3-5 over priced compare to other places.  So your  50% off is probably equivalent to 30% off, however, still a pretty good deal.  \n\nThe inside is a much bigger and fancier than it looks from the outside,  although I rarely see more than 3 tables occupied.  Because they don't have all-you-can-eat I've only ordered the special sushi rolls.  I liked everything, especially the Great White Shark roll and the Kiss of Fire roll, both spicy rolls.  The best thing about this place is that the rice on the rushi rolls is sooooo thin.  I guess that's a clever strategy by the chef to make you order more food.  \n\nOverall this has become my usual sushi place if I'm not in the mood to stuff myself into oblivion with all-you-can-eat."
1;I've been coming here with my wife for a couple of years, and this place has been little by little getting worse with their equipment (chairs and foot tubs) The pedicures are awsome, however its no long a relaxing experience.  I ill start looking for a more relaxing place for my wife and I.
1;Bleccccccccchhhhh! \n\nEveryone and their grandma has been raving about this place, so I thought I'd better go check it out. I've been wanting to check out the Eureka Casino anyway....one of those solidly un-pretentious little locals' dumps that will doubtlessly be imploded any day now. Well, after having checked it out...IMPLODE AWAY, I SAY!\n\nEverything in this restaurant is coated in/soaked in/bathed in/wallowing in grease. My friend and I shared the pot stickers as an appetizer -- they were OK, although also glistening with gratuitous grease. As far as pot stickers go...they were like any other potstickers. Except greasier. All the better to slide down your gullet, I guess.\n\nNext, I had the much-ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin to describe this monstrosity! I thought the pot stickers were greasy -- this beast was OFF THE CHAIN GREASY! It was like eating a heavily-salted Jheri curl sandwich!! I don't like wasting food, so I managed to choke down half of it before giving up -- but it was G.R.O.S.S. It was SO salty it was almost like they were trying to cover something up. Also, the grease had a weird sort of stale aftertaste, like they use the same fry oil over and over. YUCK! \n\nThe fries that accompanied the sandwich were similarly greasy. I know, I know, French fries are called FRIES because they are FRIED -- but these were ridiculous. I've had better fries in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace! The fry grease had the same gross aftertaste as the sandwich, which totally killed whatever was left of my appetite.\n\nNow, you might chalk all of this up to my being a veggie-eating commie bastard -- but guess what? My friend, who is most definitely NOT a veggie-eating commie, had the Fat Choy burger...and was similarly grossed out. He reported that it, too, was astonishingly greasy -- although he did finish the whole thing, so it couldn't have been THAT bad.\n\nYou might blame me for not having ordered something less greasy than a grilled cheese -- but the menu is extremely limited here (one page only), and since I don't like duck or pork, I didn't want to get the highly-touted bao or any of the rice dishes. I'm willing to bet they are just as greasy, anyway :-/ In fact, there wasn't much of anything on the menu that grew out of the ground -- it was all lard, grease, carbs and meat.\n\nWhat really sucks is, I came in here fully expecting to adore the place -- being as it's located in such a solidly unpretentious dive. Speaking of which.....\n\nAfter I gave up on eating, and had sopped the grease off my face with no fewer than thirty napkins, I went out into the casino to have a drink at the bar, thinking I could salvage the evening with a little people-watching and a rum & coke to cut through the grease still coating my tongue. But even that went sadly awry.\n\nFirst of all, it's a cash-only bar, and I didn't have any on me. So I had to get raped by the corner ATM, and pay a $5 surcharge...which brought the cost of my drink up to Strip prices anyway. If I'm paying Strip prices, dammit, I want to at least be able to ogle drunk bitches with fake tits, etc. But all I got was a depressing, smoke-filled room full of methheads, with Kenny Loggins playing somewhere in the background. That kind of ambiance is OK if you're in a certain mood....\n\n...but when you're already on the verge of vomiting, it ain't no fun! I finished my drink and got the fuck out of there, probably never to return. \n\nI never thought I'd say this, but...there are some places that DESERVE to be imploded. You hear that, Tony Hsieh?!! Blow this bitch sky-high and have at it -- even an elitist members-only dog park would be better than THIS!!!
2;"My friend and I decided to try Technique since Du Jour was booked.  I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try a new school.  I love that this culinary school restaurant actually looks like a restaurant.  \nNow for the food.  We started off with the bread.  Yum!  It was delicious.  Next came the appetizer.  My friend and I ordered the scallop with risotto.  I kind of with now that I had gone with the pork belly.  The scallop was perfectly cooked, but the risotto lacked some flavor. :-(  Then came my main course.  I ordered the chicken dish.  The chicken was so dry.  It was stuffed with something.  I can't remember. what it was supposed to be stuffed with, but when I looked at the chicken, the \""stuffing\"" was the tiny little area in the chicken.  It had no flavor at all.   The whipped potatoes were fine.  I'm not sure why I got the chicken.  So not like me.  Next time I will get the steak.  I tasted my friends dish and it was great!  \nNow for the dessert.  That was the best part of the whole meal!  It was a ginger spice cake with a sour cream ice cream.  Delicious!\nThe whole meal cost only $13 plus tax and tip.  \nI under stand that these are students the are still learning, so you might not have the perfect experience.  But I think that this place is worth a trying over and over again.  If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would."
0;"I use stop here on my way to work to get a pure white choc/choc ice blended drink, and have made my stops here less frequent due to the lack of so much as decent customer service.  I went there today, just trying to get my reg beverage, no line whatsoever, and somehow they managed to put espresso in my drink (Even though I emphasized \""No Coffee/Espresso\""), I went back in and asked the barista if she could remake it without the espresso. She remade.. with espresso. I ended up throwing the drink in the trash and requested a refund.\n\nI can understand if they where busy, and made the mistake, but multiple mistakes without a line is unacceptable. I won't be making my way back to this location, and will continue getting there beverages at the Townsquare location."
3;Its been said before, but they deliver until 3 AM.  We were not in the state of mind to drive and have been getting a little sick of hungry howies.  It took a solid hour for our food to arrive, but that seems pretty normal for late night Tempe. Everyone raved about the food.  It was very good for late night delivery.  The chicken bruchetta pita was excellent although a little small.  I recommend 2 pitas for anyone with any kind of appetite.  You might not get through both, but the one was just a little too small to satisfy.  My only complaint, and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5 was the traditional hummus.  I didnt not think it was very good at all.  Many places in Tempe have much better.
4;I took 2 computers within 2 days and both issues were resolved.  Very nice and explains what the problems were. Very affordable.
2;Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.
0;La sauce classic des \u0153uf b\u00e9n\u00e9dictine est a la fois trop sal\u00e9e et trop sucr\u00e9e. Le fromage sur l'\u0153uf est fade et a ma premi\u00e8re boucher il y avait un go\u00fbt de vinaigre.\n\nJe n'adore pas les patates. Elles go\u00fbtent soit le sel tr\u00e8s bon march\u00e9 et/ou il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confondu avec du sucre. Vous savez le sel est blanc et le sucre aussi. Facile de se tromper.\n\nLes cr\u00eapes fran\u00e7aise avait l'air tr\u00e8s bonne. Ils devraient peut \u00eatre se sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans les diff\u00e9rentes sortes de cr\u00eates a la place de s'aventurer vers plusieurs avenues qu'ils ne maitrise pas tr\u00e8s bien.\n\nA leurs avantages et le notre le prix n'ai pas cher dutout.
4;Outstanding Italian Food.& Pizza! They have take-out or eat in. Haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy. Highly recommended.
4;Good car. Good price. Got a mustang convertible in good shape. Saw negative reviews but the staff was not rude at all. Went over the car and the condition and gas level. They were honest and did not overcharge me. This place has some negative reviews but as long as you return the car clean, same shape as when picked up, same gas, and within the allowed miles you should be fine.
1;I've heard rave reviews about this place from my friends but thinking about it now it's probably because they were DRUNK while eating it!  Waited 20 minutes to get our food (and we were the only ones in line) then after we ordered a friend of the truck owners got there ordered and got her food first!  No good...  after the 20 minute wait we thought the food was going to be worth the wait but NOOOO!!! Our burgers were raw!  Not rare, just bloody and gross.  Never going there again!
1;I don't know if my feeling towards the Rose & Crown is partially coloured by the fact that I'm really not the biggest Rose St fan, or if it's because the pub's just a bit... well, meh.\n\nIt serves beer and has places to sit and is all around inoffensive.  That's pretty much all I can say about it.  I seem to recall it seemed dirty as well, but maybe that was just the vibe from the clientele?  I have no idea why I've been here more than once, but it is never my choosing.  If you want a proper pub, you would probably be best to stay away from Rose St all together, but if you must come to this part of town, there are practically dozens of other places you could choose from and have a more enjoyable time than in the Rose & Crown.
2;"Loved the name of this place, so i needed to investigate another happy hour. This HH goes til 7 with 1/2 price beer and a food specials menu consisting mostly of bar stuff. The $2 pretzel was killer; hot and buttery and had a decent queso dip on side. Not the same luck on the $4 street tacos. The chicken is thigh meat and the steak had no resemblence to steak or carne asada and the tacos were loaded with too much sauce and cheap cabbage. Pretty average beer selection and not all seats at the bar can view the tv screens. Nice patio though and there was one pizza with potatoes that looked unique that i need to try on next visit.  Not packed at all for monday night football."
2;Ok so I've been to a few concerts here....One thing I don't like. Grey Goose Rocks....12 dollars. Yea....plastic ware and Vodka...eh....Just put me in the backyard of Jorge Lugo's house - have his mom make tamales, and kool aid in the plastic container. Yea that is just not classy. One thing that sucks...it's downstairs. So if you don't take the elevator. People are bottlenecked and herded in. 2nd sucky thing. Kids are smelly....Boys especially. So going to a rock concert. gross...smelly....sweaty...boys...who think they're hard core and they like to mosh. One thing about me....I'm a tank. Myke Smash. Yea I rock out. But I would rather you not smash your face onto my fist. It's just weird. Overall - it's ok - I've been here when it was great. But I've been to some hot smelly crappy concerts here too. I gotta knock it for drink prices and presentation. I also knock it for having cheap concerts that attract hooligans and hoodrats with their shenanigans....Whoa...that's the whitest I've sounded all day....
1;The reason you get two stars here and not one is the fact that the wait staff is good and the food was decent. However the decor is drab, and well past it's prime. I was here for a conference, and therefore there was not too much of choice to get a cold one and watch the game. There were several TV's, although most of them were small and this place is pretty crowded when you get 15 or 20 people inside. The food was pretty good I must admit, but again the stale green carpet and dark wood paneling leave a little to be desired.
2;The carne asada tacos were amazing, reminded me of the ones in Mexico! Only thing that killed this place for me was they forgot the side of rice my girlfriend ordered, and when we finally received it the Mexican rice was undercooked, great in flavor, just super crunchy!
4;Always wanted to try a Food Network chef's restaurant, so this was our chance. My husband, me and our 3 yr old daughter had a great experience there. The food was delicious. My husband had the Crunchburger, he ate up his burger in 5 minutes! I had the L.A. Bunless Burger. The burger without the bun in a mix of greens. We shared the fries and sweet potato fries. Best sweet potato fries I have had in awhile. It came with honey mustard and chipotle cream sauce. The decor is causal, loved the design of the eating bar. Definitely will go back!
1;Was craving some wings so thought we'd catch the game here and indulge. Needless to say I told my wife I'm definitely done with Hooters. The wings aren't that great, they're overpriced and they don't hire their waitresses for good service. Arguably, they don't hire them for their looks either - doh!
4;I would give this place 4 stars based on the food alone. I had the ribs and their texture was awesome. I'm talking cliche falling off the bone delicious. They also had a nice little subtle spice to them. I'm also a big fan of the poblano mashed potatoes.\n\nThe extra star, however, is for the owner. He came out after our meal was finished to see how our food was and spent about 10 minutes having a nice conversation with my party of 6. I'm sure he had other things he could have rushed off and done, but his personal touch really meant a lot. It's not something you see much anymore outside of ultra-high class restaurants.
2;Ugh. Don't ever let me pass by a large counter of desserts. \n\nThey had a variety of sweets and pastries on display so we decided to take some home. We got a cheesecake pecan bar and a oreo bar ($2.95) and a 7layer bar ($1.95). The cheesecake pecan bar would have been the best one as the crust was good, the bar was sweet, salty and creamy but it must have been older than the other bars as there was a slight taste of the refrigerator on it. Oreo bar was more like a brownie like cake and cream cheese with some oreo on top, not very heavy on the oreo taste. 7layer was pretty good. \n\nThey were cheap and decent for a late night munchie snack, but nothing I would go out of my way for.
2;I do not go to Fresh and Easy very much.  The stores just aren't appealing to me except for a couple of items--generally snacks.  They have peanut butter filled salted pretzel nubs, some good salted kettle chips, and very decent trail mix for hiking.\n\nThat's about it for me.  I was going by here yesterday and thought it would be a quick and easy stop and it was.  Since I have no preconceived notion where things should be, I just walk around like a zombie with a purpose to find what I want.\n\nCheckout was quick--I only had two items, and then I went across the street to Albertsons where I did a bit more serious shopping.
4;"******CASINO REVIEW ONLY******\n\nI've never stayed at the hotel so I'm writing this review strictly on the casino. It is by far my favorite casino in the Las Vegas area. Now, I should admit that I never play slots, and no, not because I think they're for \""suckers\"" I just don't enjoy them. (Let's be honest, if you gamble at all... you're a bit of a sucker... these places aren't made of solid gold for no reason :-) Back to business; right when I walked in, I knew that it was going to be my kind of place. It's never ridiculously crowded. The drink servers greeted me right away and took my order. The table limits allow you to play at the level YOU decide you are comfortable with. Also, if you're a dice player, this is the only casino in Nevada that I've noticed has a Fire Bet. There is a great, reasonably priced food court if you want to grab a bite to eat and don't feel like taking out a 2nd on your house. It really is the ONLY place I feel comfortable gambling at in Nevada. 5 stars for the Jolly Green Giant. \n\nRegards,\nCFC"
2;Went there on a groupon for dinner and the comedy show.  The food was respectable but nothing great.  Think your basic Mexican joint with the standard burrito/taco/chimichangas.  Service was good even thought the server looked like she was going to be overbooked in the comedy room she did a great job of handling everyone.  The comedy itself was pretty bland but that's a different review.
2;Pretty good burger place in an airport! Got the breakfast burger and it was delicious. Bacon, fried egg and a juicy patty - what could go wrong? The price is reasonable but the portion was a bit small.
4;Had a late dinner Saturday with my boyfriend.  As the restaurant was closing we saw a band setting up.  Ask our server about what was going on.  He explained Late Night.  Must admit I was interested.  Noticed how the dining room cleared out. And as we sat there for another hour or so and ordered a glass of wine, we talked about how the place was empty.  Sitting there my boyfriend and I agreed that dinner was great, the band was good. But to make a special trip in for music at a steak house, is not something either of us would do. Felt odd sitting in a dining room listing to a band. Final thought, dinner and price was well worth the evening.  Will be back. Entertainment Late Night at a steak house not for me.
2;This is a nice limited service hotel in Middleton, next to a gigantic health club.  It is easy to get to when you get off the highway.  There isn't much you can walk to from here, but i would assume most people have a car that are staying at the Hampton Inn.\n\nThe rooms are comfortably large.  \n\nThe bed i slept in, a true King, was just so-so.  The mattress was a bit too firm and the blanket was pretty cheap.  They need an upgrade there.  The tv was a flat screen, but it was on the smaller side for the size of the room.  I did like that the bathroom i had didn't have a useless bathtub and instead had a walk in shower.  There was also complimentary Wi-Fi that worked well.\n\nThey also have breakfast in the morning.  Standard fare for these hotels.  They had nasty bacon however.  I love bacon and the bacon they had wasn't worth touching.  But the coffee, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs and fruit was fine.\n\nI would stay there again if i had to, but not my first choice in Madison.
4;I love this place!!!  They are very hard working therapists that offer massage for extremely reasonable prices.  I can afford to be a regular here because of the low cost.
2;From a business traveler perspective, I have nothing bad to say about this Avis at the Phoenix Airport.  As others have indicated in their reviews, it is worth becoming Avis Preferred so you can have a car ready and assigned to you when you arrived.  \n\nMy party got off the shuttle, walked to the board to see where our car was, found the car and checked out when we left the lot.  Piece of cake and only took a couple minutes.
3;"I have been going to Jimmy Johns Sandwich shop for 2 years now.I absolutely love there sandwiches and trust me Im a big fan. But today when I came in I was very disappointed. When I received my #9 I had ask the nice guy at the counter for 4 out of the hundereds that were in the giant box of packets of yellow mustard. He said he was only able to give me 2, 2 packets of yellow mustard for the giant sandwich I had in front of me was a joke. He said he would have to charge me 25 cents for a 5 cent packet of mustard. Thats like going to Mcdonalds and ordering 2 large frys and getting two packets of ketchup to fulfill your needs. When I asked Derek why would he have to charge a absurd price he stated \""Because Jimmy doesnt want you to ruin your sandwich\"". Iam from the greatest country on Earth the United States of America,If I want to I should have the right to put what ever I please on a sandwich. I understand that Derek was doing his job and doing what he was told, so I asked for the \""head\"" manager he directed me to Maranda(mustard natzi) a short overweight bitter woman, you could tell she was picked on in school by the look on her face and it was her mission to get back at the world. Anyways she was sitting there while all this was happening and she heard everything that was said. She would not give me the time of day, all she said was \""company policey\"" then  continued to do what ever it was she was doing. This is not right. I had to buy some candy from a local 7-11 just to get my mustard packets. This was the worst experice Ive ever had at one of there locations."
4;We decided to eat here after we ate dinner at Woo's and left hungry.  This place is very reasonably priced and the staff was very friendly.  Open 24 hours and perfect if you are staying in the Palazzo hotel.  We also ordered food to go and brought up to our hotel room.  The guy that helped us made sure we had everything we needed so we wouldn't have to come back down from the room.
1;This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!
2;Cheri's review basically says the gist. The place is a bit weird. The receptionists are a bit moody, and eventually get nicer. The rooms are much smaller than on the picture, and have none of the Hepburn portraits. (Not that they would be necessary, but it was misleading). The room is a bit dark and the AC very loud. The bathroom is tiny, but nice -- exposed brick wall and wood. Unpleasant fluorescent light. Drawback: no night lamp. The curtains are thin, so you get awaken a bit too early. Breakfast is 5$ (although advertised as free).
1;As a frequent gambler on  the Vegas Strip, I figured I'd make my way down to Fremont Street to experience the Old Vegas, Classic Vegas, whatever you want to call it, to see the older casinos.\n\nIt was nice to gamble in the casinos and walk around, and maybe I'm just used to the strip and how things are over there, but I prefer the new school look.\n\nI like roulette a lot, and not many tables had the automatic chip counter. It slows the game down, (at least it keeps money in your pockets longer). I am by no means a high roller, so when some bets that I make in the newer casinos are over the limit in the old ones, I know their is some sort of problem.\n\nZiplining. Sounded like a cool idea. But for what the ride actually was to the $20 price, not really worth it. I could say I did it and that's about it.\n\nOverall, it was basically what I Expected. I figured it wouldnt be as impressive or trendy as the strip, and it wasn't. So it should be a 3 star, but the over priced ziplining bumps it down to 2 for me. It wasn't a bad experience, just Meh.
3;One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.
1;Went to Baby Kay's on a Friday evening. There was a 30 minute wait.\n\nWe ordered some hushpuppies for an appetizer. My wife ordered a 1/2 Oyster po-boy and gumbo and I orders the shrimp basket.\n\nThe hushpuppies came out with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. The hushpuppies were ok, kind of like Long John Silver's hushpuiies. The horseradish sause was excellent though.\n\nThe service this night was not very good. We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees. The server steered clear of us most of the night, which made us angrier. If she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over, we would have understood.\n\nWe finally get our food and it is average at best. My wife's po-boy and gumbo were cold. My shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it. We were really hoping for better, especially after the wait.\n\nAfter our experience, we don't know how this place gets such good reviews.. food and service not good.
4;Dig the food here not fast food but really good food, everything I have tried is so amazing the carnitas burrito delicious the tacos are quality and the street corn reminds me of my trips to Mexico when I was younger.
2;Its Starbucks. Inside the Casino. Coffee was yummy. Exactly what you're expecting when u walk in.
2;Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\n\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\n\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\n\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\n\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.
1;"\""Not quite what I expected... not quite WHERE I expected either...\""\nReviewed July 24, 2011\n4 people found this review helpful\nI have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.\n\nI booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \""oh-so enthused\"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \""airport\"".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \""Deborah\"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"
0;This place is drowning my food with canola oil! Yikes! Heart attack awaits me, if I continue to eat here!
1;We booked a table at Gali's for a bite to eat before the Scotland/England rugby game, so needless to say the place was heaving. The staff coped really well with the number of covers they had to deal with and the food was.OK. It's not the best looking of places and the food doesn't look too enticing wither when it arrives but it tastes good. I did end up with a wine glass full of floaters and a hair in it though, I hadn't noticed til I was futher down the glass or I'd have sent it back. Good atmosphere, nice staff, just a bit dated and perhaps not the nicest of settings.
1;This place has good food but horrible customer service. They used to be wonderful and it was such a treat when I would drive thirty minutes just to eat here. I probably pass 25 sushi places just to get here and it was always worth it but the past couple times it has gone downhill.
3;Took my friend to try his first pho here. It was my first time here too. The pho wasn't half bad, probably the best pho in vegas. Lots of meat in the pho, broth was flavorful. We also ordered the spring rolls and nem nuong roll. It was fresh and yummy.. Will try this place again my next vegas trip.
4;"Quality you can count on!  \n\nI'm sure this slogan is being or has been used by someone else, but it rings true at this establishment.  \n\nBeing an espresso drinker, I've tasted bad, burnt, awful espresso, here's looking at you Charbucks, but Central Coffee is none of the above.  Their espresso is rich, fresh, clean, satisfying and rivals the best I've ever had (Caff\u00e9 Ladro).  On occasion I'll get the \""Shorty\"" which has one shot, frothed milk, and a shot of vanilla; it's a great drink when I'm looking for something different but still want the pick me up.  Stop by on the weekend (8-12) when they offer a hot out of the oven veggie quiche and breakfast casserole; I'll vouch for the breakfast casserole.  And don't miss out on their Wednesday pound coffee deal, 15% off each pound purchased.  Stop throwing your money away on convenience (Starbucks) and try something new and something your taste buds will appreciate CENTRAL COFFEE, you won't regret it."
3;This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, within a couple of blocks of Saint-Catherine shopping and the Place Des Arts.  I stayed here for one night on pleasure.  It's worth noting that I stayed with a Living Social coupon for $185/night plus tax, which is essentially 50% off.  I also know other travellers who have gotten a room for $200/night on Priceline.com.  I would NOT pay the $300-$350/night they ask on the website as full-price.\n\nThat being said, they gave us a beautiful, larger corner room.  There wasn't much view (other than the windows of adjacent buidlings), but the room was luxurious, with a nice, large washroom (including separate standing shower and bathtub).  Service was excellent, and I have no complaints.\n\nWhile people seem to complain about the expensive wifi, I was able to use wifi for free while in my room.  It switched to a pay-policy when in the lobby or restaurants.  Not sure why...\n\nThe hotel also has a fantastic restaurant (Osco!), and a fun absinthe bar (Sarah B.).\n\nI would recommend this restaurant, assuming you can get a deal on the room price.
4;I came here (gasp!) not for the pizza, and I was soooo impressed.\n\nThis place does nothing cheap or low-end.  Every ingredient is carefully picked and often of the organic/sustainable variety.  The dishes are carefully thought-out, and pay close attention to flavor profiles and presentation.  The meat and cheese plate was fantastic, the polenta is an absolute must here, and the clams were just great.  Way better than expected beer and wine list too.  The servers know their stuff.  Foodies will love it here.  The price is right for what you get, which is a nice surprise too, considering I expected more of a Strip mark-up.\n\nThank you 550 for not catering to the drunk slob crowd, but still finding a way to please them too.
2;A lot of these reviews made me laugh because I'm not quite sure what people were expecting - it's FAST FOOD, (albeit pricy fast food)lol! I had a Groupon so my friends and I went all out so that we could get a variety of things.  I thought the staff here was really friendly, even bringing food to our table.  The shakes are amazing and I love all the topping options!  The veggie burger is tasty and my friends devoured their beef burgers.  Although the curly fries are the most popular, we decided the skinny fries are the best. Thumbs up!
1;"The wife and I have eaten at lots of sushi restaurants, including Morimoto in NYC, and we had high expectations for this place. The service was good to great, but you would expect that from a restaurant of this price, but what's the deal with all the caucasian waiters who can't even pronounce omakase?! (For the record, it's oh-ma-ka-say, not oma-case)\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty lacking. It was dark, loud, and looked almost like someone sort of gave up on the decoration. It was just so-so nice and didn't really give off any particular vibe. And I've never been to any kind of restaurant other than a hole-in-the-wall where they give you the bill on a freaking round white plate. Then after you give them a credit card, they bring back the receipt and a pen. Yes, just the receipt and a pen. No plate, no folio, nothing. They just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen. Does that scream 4-star restaurant to you?\n\nWhen trying out new sushi restaurants, we always like to order some of the basics, to get a foundation to compare against other places. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plates. Both had decent to very good fish (but not *great*) except for two big disappointments: the tuna was really mediocre, and hello! take it easy on the wasabi, chef! Sushi chefs that use too much wasabi are either trying to cover up not-so-fresh fish, or they're just not really good at making sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, so I don't think they were trying to cover anything up, which leaves......\n\nMaybe we should've had lower expectations when we came in, or maybe Nobu is only good with the fancier dishes. But for the prices they charge for \""regular\"" sushi and sashimi, it's just not worth it.\n\nThe service gets a 4. The decor/vibe gets a 2.5, and \nif the prices were maybe 30-40% lower, I could easily have given them 3 or maybe even 4 stars. But for what you get, I'd give them a 2.5. But since yelp doesn't let you give half stars, I'd round off this overpriced place to a 2."
3;Had lunch here today and more than a few times..always good for me..The owner and his daughter are not the happiest of people but they get the job done.(the mom is super nice!).   To Dad and daughter Your customers will either make or break you..! So be nice and say hello ,thank you and have a good day. If your considering eating here..ENJOY! I always do.
2;"First off, I really like the food.  The quality is good-to-exceptional and execution/presentation is good as well.  My issue isn't with the food.  It is with their handling of their own monthly food discounts/offers, called \""Beer And Bites Club\"". BTW, I like the waitstaff but it seems that the disconnect is between marketing and management (according to a manager).  The last time I was there, the manager also didn't want to accept my Yelp check-in (1 Free Domestic Pint or Well Drink).  He acted like Yelp was almost some type of scam where Yelp creates bonuses without businesses knowing. \n\nIt has gotten to the point that the regulars that I go with will no longer go.  They used to go twice a week and me, once a week.  Hopefully someone will read this & fix the problem.  I will give this location one more chance, but I am not confident that anything will change.\n\nTo make this a little more constructive:\n1) Football specials are/were amazing\n2) Great burgers; the Kobe is exceptional\n3) Excellent BBQ ribs, meaty, tender, & slathered in BBQ sauce\n4) Coconut Shrimp appetizer seems like it belongs in a Steak House, the taste & presentation are so good. Sweet coconut+savory shrimp+great sauce=amazing!\n5) Great ambiance\n\nWith all said & done, the 3 star rating is being given because of my past experiences during football season.  If I were to base it on my last 3 visits, 2 stars.\n\nPlease, please Adonna, please read this & correct the problems..."
4;Gawd. Best morning ever. Waking up and realizing you went to Ian's, and there's still some in the fridge.\n\nI never go to Madison without stopping at Ian's at least once. Unlike others, I've never been a huge fan of the mac 'n' cheese slices. I'd never turn down a bite, but I rarely order a whole slice of it for myself because I find it less interesting than the other flavors. \n\nI do, however, enjoy anything with roasted red peppers, pesto or olive tapenade, plus all the Mexican ones, steak and fries (with BBQ) and the buffalo chicken. There's always a bunch of sauces and sprinkles (cheese and red pepper) to add to your 'za after you get it, so I spend some time there before finding a seat in the restaurant or on the curb outside.\n\nIt's hard to choose, and my college roomie and I were both into sharing, so we I had a system. We would order three slices between the two of us and then have them cut all of them in half. It was legendary, always getting to try three kinds for the price of one and a half. Highly recommended.\n\nThis bigger location on State St. seems to run smoothly every time I've been there, and I always get a kick out of the fact that they have Yelp stickers everywhere.\n\nFor late-night food, Ian's is as good as it gets... anywhere.
1;#1: Rooftop was closed. That was one of the main reasons I wanted to go to Pure. Ugh.\n\n#2: Guestlist line? What line? I thought I was gonna get stampeded by girls with 5 inch stilettos and squashed by men who thought they were bounchers. Whatever - still pushed my way up to the front. \n\n#3: Music was pretty crappy. I just wasn't feeling it... what did the BF say? Oh yeah - the vibe from the crowd wasn't helping because there was NO vibe other than lots of guys who stood there like statues.\n\nI got my boyfriend and I in for free but will probably not return. Why would you want to pay $20-$50 to go into this joint anyway? There were no go-go dancers when we went!! We stayed for about 30 minutes tops.\n\nOnto the next venue..
3;Came here for an anniversary as it was one of the top 10 Zagat rated spots a few years ago.\n\nWhile the food quality did meet the price mark, I was sort of disappointed with the Ravioli and Oysters. We got a 1 foot long dish with 3 oysters on it. 3 is not divisible by two. So, they could add one more and make everyone happy.\n\nHowever, the cocktails and the wine selection were good and the food was definitely savory. Service was great as well. Come well dressed or you will look bad.
3;Good as Home Depot can be. Depending on your taste, Lowe's may or may not be better for you. They're the same but different. :) Selection/brands that is.
0;"I recently stayed at Cancun Resort in Las Vegas, and attended a Diamond resorts sales presentation with Ricky Poyner.  The overall presentation was pleasant although Ricky,  the salesman deliberately lied about them checking my credit.  He mentioned several times that they don't check credit. Immediately following the presentation, I received a notification of an inquiry from Diamond International on my credit report. \nI'm confused?  Did the salesman deliberately LIE to me? \n\nIs this a business of INTEGRITY?  Had we known that attending the presentation would be an inquiry on our credit,  we could have decided whether or not to proceed. That choice was not given to us.\n\nI don't believe this was a training issue because the salesman said several times, \""we will not check your credit.\""\n\nI have sent a complaint and awaiting a response"
2;Hidden little nook, right next to JcPenny (on the south west side). \n\nIf you are anything like me & don't own a needle & thread (it's sad, I know!) then this is a good place to go if you need to have something hemmed or tailored.\nThey also do embroidery, although that can get a bit price if you are wanting an intricate or large design. My daughter had her best friends initials embroidered onto a small bag & it was $15, reasonable I think, & it came out really nice! It does add a little something extra & makes gifts more personal & thoughtful :)  \n\nAn important note, so you won't be caught off guard, this store works on CASH only & requires pre-payment. \n\nDuring the holiday season the turn around time was 1 week, but maybe now that it's over the wait time is less.
1;"Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \""Sammy\"" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \""I'll be with you in a moment\"" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying."
3;"Been in here more times than I can count.  Likely have a stake at this point in one of the boilers...\n\nThere is a rhythm to this place.  Like a hectic Starbucks (do these exist anymore?) or the DMV.  Bottom line is that It takes a few passes to get the swing of it.  Don't roll in all Einsteins-fresh and go \""hey, what about my microwave heated egg patty?!?!?\""\n\nGet to know this little gem and let them get to know you.  It's a dance people, it takes a few turns to get it.  After that, I believe you will experience a excellent value, consistency, and yes - friendly and helpful staff that I look forward to saying \""good morning\"" too.  \n\nBTW - one of the few places that will keep me drinking hot coffee in the summer due to their Kona!"
2;I have never gambled here, nor had a meal in any of there Restaurants.  I have really only been here to go see a movie in the theater.  So, with that said.... parking was easy, all of the employees we came into contact with were nice and the signage was easy to follow.  So, I have no complaints nor did I have any expectations.  I will update my review if I ever do anything substantial here.
2;We got to our Hotel finally at 5 pm, we were stucked literally on the strip for 1 hour and 1/2, pretty exhausted only to wait in the registration line for 45 minutes. The hotel clerk checking us kept on talking and talking.\n\nThen off we go to our 8th room floor, only to find out that the room was not clean. There's even a note from the previous occupants about stain in the pillow and bed. Ewww.....\n\nMy friends were very polite and nice, called up the housekeeping but I wasn't having it. I'm very tired, before flying in Vegas I was working early at the hospital that same day. I expect nothing but the best. I then called up the operator and demanded to speak with the floor manager only to be transferred to a voicemail. That didn't help my mood so I called her back, pissed off. After a few minutes of holding. I was instructed for our group to go down and be given another room.\n\nOnce we hit the registration desk, a clerk apologize and upgraded our room to suite instead. So off we go round 2.\n\nWe were given the suite on the 22nd floor, in fact it was the Bruce Willis room, scored. The minute we step in the room you can smell cleanliness. Bathroom was huge, plenty of mirrors/lights and perfect for 4 girls. We even have a plasma tv and view of the strip. The only thing we didn't like was it was dark, we only have 2 lamps and 1 lamp desk. Maybe they were trying to create a romantic mood.\n\nThe PH valet were great and some of them are eye candy too. I'll stay in PH only if it is a suite.
3;Who goes to Vegas & goes to PF Chang's? Rofl. Well, we were hungry, staying at Planet Hollywood & had been up since 5am. Sooooo, this is how we ended up here. PF Chang's is always great. No wait, service was good & the food was delicious! No complaints!
0;This is the second time we have tried this place, trying to give it a second chance.  NEVER AGAIN :-/  The food is bad and the service sucked :-(  I am actually normally nice and try to be nice in my comments but I have nothing positive to say about this place. The only positive is that I will never have to eat there again :-)
0;Horrible service today, 8/2/14, around 5:30pm. We waited a long time in line because the person taking orders was pretty leisurely about it. But the WORST was the 30 minute wIt for a corn dog and French fries!! Everyone ordering ice cream sundaes gets served first by the same cook the makes the food like hamburgers and for dogs as well! We were #27 and ice ream orders in the high 30's were being Called while we were still waiting. Worst thing is when I saw our food up and they still didn't call our #. Stay away. Not worth waiting half hour in 100+ degree heat.
0;This place always sends out shady advertising deals. I am not sure what they mean by we love locals because we are locals and avoid this place like the plague.
4;This is a great gym. It's small so it isn't overwhelming. They have exactly what you need to get a good workout in. There aren't any meat heads like at globo gym, I mean golds. The staff is friendly and Ralph is great! There's some nice eye candy from time to time as well. The steam room is a great feature as well. I actually prefer this location over the Shea location because you don't have to deal with all the D-bag high school kids working out on their phones taking up equipment. Arin at the desk makes a killer smoothie too!
4;Top-notch service Matthew is the best. Very friendly very courteous and does a wonderful job. Highly highly recommend.
1;On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 5.  The burger was tasteless, the bun ordinary. They mixed up our order -- I got fries instead of onion rings. They apologized and brought out onion rings a few minutes later which were fine, but not great. I nibbled some of the fries while waiting and they were average. I think $10 - $12 for a basic burger and fries (or onion rings at no extra charge) is out of line. The beer was good -- tasty and cold. Service was, again, average. The place was not crowded on a Friday night and I can see why. If you're looking for a good hamburger, keep looking. You can do better.
0;Sbarro is always the worst thing ever, but sometimes, when you are in an airport and you need to cram a quick bite down your gullet, you take the hit.  And sometimes when you do that, you will discover that the terrible Sbarro you grew up with at your local mall was in fact a superb and splendid culinary experience compared to what the Las Vegas airport offers by way of Sbarro.  \n\nI am 95% sure if you fed this to an elderly person or a small child, both groups with immune system issues, it would kill them.
1;Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!
3;Honestly, wings are probably my favorite food on the planet. I'll get them any way I can. BWW always has good variety and plays just about every sporting event known to man, which makes this place all the better for me. I'll be spending a lot of time here during football season. My new love is the Thai curry.
1;Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.  \n\nThis is not what I am used to for a QT.
0;"I went back four years later to taste the Bloody Mary again before flying back home. This time, it was a huge and disappointing mistake that left me vomiting at the airport and upon immediate arrival back home. \n\nIncidentally, Sigi was our server again! And as sweet as ever. But the fact that they bring out the food on trays with sterling silver covers over everything like it is that one \""Be Our Guest\"" scene in Beauty and the Beast does not change the reality of the situation, which is that the food there looks, feels and tastes like an abomination that was relegated from a preschool arts and crafts class. My chicken noodle soup was curiously sweet, with dirty carrots and undercooked macaroni, all of which had settled to the bottom. The spicy buffalo wings were completely dry with pepper flakes thrown on them, and one broke into two soft lumps with some brown stuff that came out of it. You could take any seasoned inmate there and even he could tell you that it is worse than prison food. I know, because I did. \n\nJust kidding. But that is the only part I am joking about, because I suffered for the twelve hours afterwards. Skip America and grab a bagel or something."
1;Located on The Las Vegas Strip. Yes, it's big and shiny, but I am not a particular fan of Aria or City Center in general. I will give a few reasons. The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
1;Waited for 45 minutes on a weeknight before we got our table. Table view was amazing on the second floor but that was the only thing amazing during that night. Dynamite Shrimp had no kick at all, Dandan Noodles were soggy, Mongolian Beef was overcooked and chewy and our Calamari appetizer came AFTER our entrees were served. Our server was really efficient though, refilling our waters on point and following up on our calamari. But if i wanted asian/chinese food, i wouldn't go back to PF Changs.
0;"If you're in search of food, keep driving.  \nIf you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  \n\nI used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  \""Penny's Pies\"".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   \n\nKeep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   \n\nJ ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  \n\nJ gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  \n\nOur dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as \""vegetables\"".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  \n\nThe waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  \n\nWhen the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true \""Penny's Pie\"".  More like a bad knockoff.    \n\nThe only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  \n\nWe stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.\n\nAnd we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  \n\nAnd - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)"
0;Absolutely the worst place, If you are trying to loose your ride take it her. My wife took my Passat for oil change for the past 9 month!!! When she found they refill the synthetic for the of the service...!!!! Right? Sounds like great deal... Not knowing they are using recycled oil or something... I found out when my Passat had starting making noise and the engine starting making loud noise!!! The oil change did not last 100 miles!!! The oil that the dealer showed me was black dark, thick and dirty. Now why after 100 mile from an oil change do I see a synthetic oil as dark as tar... Save money and your car. Never would I bring my cars to this place.
0;This used to be a long-time favorite of ours but we had a horrible experience this year. Went at 7PM on a Tuesday. There was no one in front of us in line, but the cashier kept talking on phone and would not look at us. When I motioned to other cashier on other side of desk, she turned her back to us. When we did get in (maybe 12-15 minutes later), the popular food dishes were almost empty, and the few workers behind the counters were not in a hurry to make more available despite requests. The server brought first round of drinks rapidly but no straws then disappeared for 30-40 minutes (he later said he got a party of 25 in the next seating area). Price has not gone down but the overall experience has seriously declined. Too bad because this used to be my #1 favorite place before the change in ownership and management.
4;"Incredibly large and beautifully designed outdoor shopping mall with every store you could ever need all in one fail swoop.  You can get your groceries (Whole Foods), household items (Target), shopping on (Apple, H and M, etc.), and dining all in one trip!  This is truly genius and something I wish I had in my neighborhood.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous when we went; making an outdoor stroll pleasant and enjoyable.  There is also a nice green space right in the center where families and chill and kids can relax. The architecture is modern with an Italian stucco flavor.  Great place to take the family on the weekend."
4;After reading a few reviews its funny how many complain about the club being crowded and expensive.  Who wants to go to a half-empty club? Then go to a effin lounge who let's Tom, Dick, and Harry in along with their grandmothers and aunt.  \n\nAnyhow, if you spend $96 million on a club it better be top-notch and it is.  If you partying in a $96 million club, it isn't going to be cheap and you wont find dollar drinks.  So if you are a baller on a budget stick to lounges with no lines. \n\nThe gold you see is real 24k gold, but good luck trying to steal it. Bouncers are abundant but overall, they are better than other clubs.  The cocktail waitress are super model HOT, but that's all about you're gonna get unless you got a Blackcard.  Any VIP table inside the club has decent view of dancefloor and traffic flow is great to fish for hotties walking by.  Tables outside arent optimal for tailchasing and are cheaper than inside of course.  However, if you get a daybed by the pool it is romantic spot for your date or fling for the night.  Great makeout spot or to have a pre-qualifier conversation.\n\nGetting inside isnt too difficult if you have a table.  If you are paying cover, then expect to wait at least an hour.  It's a $96 million dollar club, DUH! \n\nWhat I particularly like about it is traffic flow is good, getting in and out of club is good, decor is excellent, and it's just bright enough to get a good look at people even if you have your beer googles on.  \n\nOnly thing is their sound system could be improved.  You dont feel the crisp bass.  Sometimes there is an ordor from the bathroom areas.  They need to keep air-spraying scents into the ventilation.  \n\nDeadmau5 is resident 2012 and rumor has it Tiesto too. \n\nIm a regular here since day one. So if you need further advice LMK.
4;Best beers you can get in the valley.\n\nKiltlifter, SunBru, 8th Street, Peach Ale you can't go wrong with any of these.
3;I lift the weights and I put them down! This review is only for the actual free weights / gym area as I did not use any of the spa services.\n\nOne of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.\n\nThe facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.\n\nThe hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home.\n\nIt's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used.
4;Went with the my husband to check out the quad. Ventured over here for a bite. We sat at the bar and first off they bring water right away. Being a tree huger I'm a little torn by that. I do always ask for a water to start. I ordered the Palermo and  my husband had  Pancho Via. My drink was outstanding and made with great tequila. I think they make there own house brand. The Pancho via is jalape\u00f1o  tequila watermelon and cucumber. Of course I had to try. So refreshing! I will definitely have some of those come summer time. We had the sopes and lobster tacos. Both were very good. Great dj and as others mentioned mechanical bull. Nice environment plus they have a little lounge area and balcony upstairs. This will be great in the summer. \n\nTIP: we parked at Cesar's forum shops valet and crossed the street. I think this might be the easiest  parking.
0;I recently had cox out to install internet and cable. \nWhen I received the bill, Cox had charged me to fish 3 lines into the walls and one from the front of my unit. So there are 4 seperate charges for puling lines into my unit.\nBesides having a coupon for free installation, my unit had just been renovated and the General Contractor had put all new lines in the wall and could be accessed right at the attic opening. I told COX that the GC could confirm that the lines were there. I explained to COX communications that there was a mistake and that I shouldn't be charged for the fished lines.  Cox said they were going to investigate this, but they never even called me back and the charges are still on my account. They have the worse customer service and I should have ordered Direct TV. \n-Mike in Phoenix
3;Straight and to the point--- nice atmosphere, large portions, and we liked what we ordered, there was lots of flavour and good bread. It wasn't anything to write home about, but we didn't leave disappointed and that matters a lot when you're travelling (I would learn this lesson later at another restaurant). We would go back.
3;3.5. It was very quiet when we went, no dancers or band. The food and service were great- the one exception being the salad. It had too much dressing. The feta was delish- very subtle. \nI had the moussaka- it was very tasty! Decent portions size, along with potatoes and vegetables. They are not stingy with the bread either, which is a rarity. My companion had the chicken with lemon and artichoke, it was good, but I preferred my moussaka.\nWould I go back? Absolutely. But next time, Id like to see the dancers!
1;"So... After being excited about the decent room rate and booking the room, I came across a number of reviews that described horrible sounding conditions of the rooms, including a bed bug and roach infestation. I told my husband we were not going to even take our stuff or kids in the room until I did a thorough inspection. After quickly reading up on how to conduct a bed bug inspection (thanks Google), I checked the room thoroughly and was happy to find no signs of bed bugs or roaches. So we stayed. \n\nWould I stay again? No. After you walk through the large hotel that doesn't seem too bad, you walk back outside to the \""courtyard\"" rooms. Sounds nice, right? Nope. It feels like you're walking out of the real hotel and walking into the motel behind it. Rooms just seem very run down, a little dirty, carpets stained, etc. The beds seemed clean, which is what led us to stay, but I didn't want the kids to even take their socks off or play on the ground at all. Its a good backup, but we personally won't do it again."
3;I was starving and wandering around without a clue where I was and I found here the best sandwich (tomato, brie, pesto, brocolli on wonderful baguette, save half for later!) and the best coffee (served with a lovely macaron and a shot of soda water).
0;I will never go back there again... we had 9 people all of us nicely dressed except for my brother in law that flew in from Hawaii (marine) for his sisters  birthday. he was wearing a polo jeans and work boots.. we were at VB GB for a while and then went to Ohso for a drink.. the birthday girl wanted to dance so we figured to head to Label.. the cover charge was 15 bucks.  and they wouldn't let in my brother in law because he had on boots.. then proceeded to blame it on his attitude after they wouldn't let him in.. I just think it's really wrong to not let in somebody that serving your country.  he's 25 and mature enough to handle a situation and not hurt anybody with his boots..
0;I have shopped here off & on for years. I am always amazed I return due to the awful service & attitudes but with so few Needlework shops in Phoenix I have bit my tongue & gone.  I recently inquired about a Special Order Canvas for my Birthday. I FB them & called both. After 2 weeks of trying to get them to help me they responded by leaving me a phone message stating they had No Idea what canvas I was talking about. I have ordered from them before. The canvases are hundreds of dollars & I fail to see where the confusion came in considering I had Put the comeplete title & artist in my facebook message. I have ordered the canvas elsewhere. I don't know if it is just me they seem to dislike without knowing me or if it is just being outside the clique that is the issue. Order online unless your a Stepford Sticher.
1;Well, if you like mediocre food and lackluster service, then you'll love BJ's!\n\nThe food is on par with what you would expect from a chain restaurant. Decent but nothing really exciting. \n\nService was pretty slow. Our friend ordered a pi\u00f1a colada. After she tried it, my wife and I both tried a sip. It tasted of a little alcohol and blended ice. She returned it for a pepsi. \n\nThen my wife had ordered an appetizer salad. Our entrees were delivered, and no salad. The server realized she forgot the salad and told us she would bring it out and have the manager take it off our bill. \n\nThen the server offered a refill on our friend's pepsi, and brought a diet pepsi. \n\nNow I know why it's been almost a year since I've been to a BJ's, and why I'll most likely never go back.
1;"This is the only pet store (that I know of) in my area that carries Grandma Mae's Country Naturals dog food - so this is the ONLY reason I go here. Otherwise, I wouldn't give this store a second thought. Their products are pretty much all overpriced. Every time I come in, the staff is so-so - not the friendliest bunch. These people seem to find it very hard to say \""hi.\"" No people skills whatsoever!! One guy in there is pretty douche-y. I don't bother to find out his name. If anyone knows of another store that carries Grandma Mae's, let me know - I'd much rather go there! I'm seriously considering changing the brand I buy so these people don't ruin my outing to the pet store."
1;Well the food is good and you get a lot if you can actually get them to bring it to you and forget about refills or if you'd like more than a thimble of syrup good luck. Had to flag down a second server to find both our drink order and our request for extra syrup and blue cheese. He at least was very prompt. Don't understand why they just don't keep syrup on the tables. Happy with the food, but very disappointed with the service.
0;"I would never recommend living in this apartment place. I've lived in several wonderful apartments throughout downtown Phoenix and Tempe, but never have I experienced such a terrible living situation as I have at Mill Pointe Aparments. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. constant crime area: gunshots, homeless walk freely through the property grounds, strangers/possible harmful individuals knocking on your door pretending to be servicemen, police constantly driving through but never actually doing anything, etc. when coming home at night time, ive noticed plenty of clearly ODD people sneaking around the parking lot, looking through cars. in one instance i saw a man that lived in an apartment at mill pointe chasing after a man with a mask, claiming he was looking through the windows of his home watching his family.\n\n2. mgmt company: every time i have called them for a work order, or alterations to my lease, or any kind of question, the manager of the complex is ALWAYS \""out in a meeting\"" and/or unavailable. no matter when i call, morning noon or evening. after becoming upset about this recurring problem, i called and once again they told me jennifer the manager was in a meeting, so i walked down to the offices, and there was jennifer in her office, alone with the door shut. (i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours.\n\n3. the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in. flies and gnats everywhere. my neighbor had told me upon her moving in, her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches. the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure, such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet.\n\n4. work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice. i, nor did most of my connecting neighbors, have hot water for over 48 hours, MULTIPLE TIMES.\nI called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door. he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock. i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle, he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether, rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportant.\n\nAll other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above. \nSTAY AWAY."
3;"I dig it. It reminds me of restaurants I would frequent back home in San Francisco. I found it to be a very cool spot with friendly, efficient bartenders and servers, diverse (yet relevant) menu and handsome architecture. I love the open airy-ness about the restaurant and the combination indoor-outdoor bar area.  The brick oven is impressive, the wines are exciting and the food is phenomenal.  Everything is very reasonably priced, including drinks.  Parking is valet-only, but it's complimentary. St. Francis is the perfect place for drinking wine with friends, and has definitely been added to my happy hour rotation.  It also strikes me as a great \""date\"" spot. Not that I'm in any danger of needing to be concerned about that. \n\nFor as cool as this spot is, nobody there seems to be up their own a$$ about it. The ever-increasing cloud of smug I've noticed in Phoenix has definitely passed over St. Francis."
2;"This place has come a long way from the early days of the \""South Coast\"" hotel and casino. Back then, after being only open a few weeks, I experienced terrible customer service and mediocre food.\n\nLast night, my cousins and I wanted some late night steak and eggs, so we picked the South Point. I was surprised at the quality of food. The cut of New York steak was visibly better than some others I've had lately. It wasn't the most tender on the inside, but still good. In any case, it's easily one of the better steak and egg graveyard specials in town. My cousins also seemed to enjoy the items they ordered. In particular, they were impressed by the vanilla ice cream."
4;We competed at this event this year (Little Miss BBQ) and we thought the location was absolutely incredible.  This is their 4th BBQ event and the only major issue this time was the heat which is out of their control.  Teams had samples the whole time and the area wasn't cramped like it was over at the Waterfront location.
1;Very disappointed...calamari was salty & Cesar salad had a bottle dressing not good. Overall food was average not worth the premium price!!!
0;"Place is sad! Place has little to no hope! The brats that run it are rude! The kids that sell food are not trained! They were closed for how many years? They had how many other water parks in the country? Who designed this place a class of kindergarteners? The lay out is stupid! The lazy river is tiny ! I have seen apartment complexes with bigger kids areas ! The life  guards ? All I have to say is I hope they never have to save anyone in my family! The movies in the wave pool! My tv is bigger and has better picture too! I am a season pass holder! 2 years now! It has not gotten better it's gotten worse! The place is hot like hell the water is freezing and they have nothing for kids other then the 3 little slides that are super crowded because the bucket area which the employees have named \""Misery Island\"" is too rough and crazy for little kids! Place is off my list haven't been back in 5 weeks! Cowabunga bay........ They were late but they got it right for the kids! Anyway I can get a refund wet n wild? LoL yeah right a joke should have stayed closed"
4;added the lengua taco to the tried list today -- wow -- so delicious...\n\ndon't know what Gabriel is talking about fried fish -- their fish is only served as cocktails or on the half shell (oysters) -- no fish tacos -- nothing fried.  And the cashier always speaks english -- she has to since she runs the drive thru, too -- \n\nYes, there aren't that many white folk -- but that's fine with me -- Took my 72 year old white mother for tongue and pastor tacos -- and to share a shrimp cocktail, with watermelon juice --   tears, people, tears, it was so good...   I keep looking for flaws, but there just aren't any.
1;Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
4;This place was smaller than I expected, but we didn't have trouble getting a table on a Friday night around 6:30.  I am still fairly new to Vegas, and came here with some friends who have tried many sushi places in town and said this place is their favorite.  For the price and the quality of the fish, it can't be beat. I was amazed that for an all you can eat sushi place, I can order anything off the menu, even appetizers and the special items like sea urchin.  Plus it included dessert, which was a way to end the meal.  I don't think I can go to a regular sushi place now after going to Brian's Beach because you get so much quality sushi here for your money!
3;Ann was very professional while I was standing there practically (or totally) naked!  She made me feel very comfortable and always offered me the best deal possible.  I had never had a spray tan before and visited her multiple times.
0;Not even worth it.. $130 for a family of 4. This is the PF Chiang's or worse of Mexican Food.. $5 horchata and $10 Churros? Comedor dela Guadalajara is still the bomb...
3;I just came here for lunch yesterday and it did not disappoint. Their pasta, seafood, and desserts are really good and I got full off of those alone. They do have sushi hand rolls and california rolls but they aren't anything special. I was sold once I had the parisian macaroons for dessert....yummm! The only thing I didn't really like was the kobe beef. It was as rare as it gets which is just not my style. it was so rare that I had to basically saw it to cut it but even then it was too rare to enjoy. I didn't try the other beef cuts but my boyfriend kept going back for seconds so it must've been good. Definitely worth the $20 something dollars per person!
1;Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking.
2;2.5 stars\n\nWhere can I find good Hawaiian bbq in the Tempe area?  Anyone?  I looked up this place a few weeks back and trekked across town to try it... the end result was, it was ok.  After a entree, musabi and drink, the price was too high for what this is.  And other than the macaroni salad (which I loved) the food was average.  If it was average and cheap, I'd come back.  Or if it was pricey and delish, I'd come back.  As it is now though... I probably wouldn't make the drive again unless I absolutely cannot find any other place to get spam musabis. lol\n\nProlly won't see ya there.
3;I can only speak about the experience of Happy Hour. I was all about cheap drinks and a new experience and that is what I got. $1 beer shots during the 3-6pm Happy Hour allowed me to try several different beers that I would never have known about. They have a pretty extensive wall of beers. The bartenders (I went 2 days in a row) were friendly and knowledgeable. They gave me beer education and guided me on what beers to try based on my likes and dislikes.
4;Beautiful restaurant that came highly recommended to myself and my date. Romantic setting that is also good for larger groups. The waitstaff was helpful and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu and wine list, and gave us great advice as to how we should tackle such a diverse and interesting menu. \n\nIf you are in the 412, certainly stop here for dinner. The avocado and crab meat tian was to die for, and order the duck as your main entree- you won't believe your tastebuds. Also, who knew chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e existed? It does at Sonoma. And you don't want to leave without tasting it.
2;You like steak?  You like titties?  Come to Treasures for both!\n\nFood:  Fantastic!  Treasures was classy and their steaks were on par with some of the high end steakhouses that I had in the past.  Steak prices ranged between 40-70 dollars and sides are separate.  They also had a huge lobster tail and filet mignon special for $65.  Even if you're not down for titties, I would recommend coming here for dinner.\n\nGirls:  Better than average.  My friends argue that Spearmint has the best girls but I say that's only because they have more to pick from.  On an average basis, I think Treasures wins.  The venue is much more luxurious compared to Spearmint and it's less crowded.  If you want to get titty slapped with class, Treasures is the way to go!\n\nAnother word of advice, call their limo service to save on cover charge.  702-259-GIRL.  We didn't know about the free cover if they pick you up, so my friends and I ended up paying $30 each...which could have gone to another 10 lap dances.
0;"So, I was all set to give this bar a solid four stars...\n\nThey feature live music quite a bit.  Been here once a few times recently.  The first seeing a band from Austin.  It's a solid, clean, neighborhood spot a half step above dive.  The drinks are good, and fairly priced.  They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\n\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.  All the sides were fairly good.\n\nThe food was an excellent value for the price point.  Checking out the menu we saw that their other, daily basis, menu items were at really reasonable prices as well\n\nJust a nice four star kinda bar, until after our visit last night.  Five housemates, two ate the burger.  Others had veggie burger, and the chili dog.  \n\nThe fries are pretty great.  Upon noticing the menu claimed the fries were baked, and not greasy, MrT asked why anyone would want them.  But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\n\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.  All set to give the Iron Post a solid four stars.\n\nUntil a few hours after we got home.  The burger dinner folks BOTH had food poisoning!\n\nOne of the food poisoned has stated since that her six week recovery from heart surgery was less painful than her case.  She ended up having to go to the hospital for it.\n\nSo, be warned.  Maybe stick with sides or veggie options here?  Don't know if I'd ever go meat here again!  \n\nI'd give the place another chance, steering(huhuh) clear of the meat.  I would give the bar more stars, but can't forgive the disgustingly, painfully stricken."
2;I came across Sushi Too as I was searching for a dinner place. The set up and service was nothing fantastic but it still worked. A few tables and booths scattered inside the restaurant. \n\nThe portions were pretty large. I ordered a seaweed salad and a huge bowl of it came. I rolled out of the restaurant after having 2 special rolls and a bottle from their selection of beers. There were a number of regular and special rolls, deluxe platters, different appetizers, and cooked entrees.
3;This place is pretty neat. The brews are decent, the staff is amazing, and the vibe is low-key. I always have a pretty decent time here and I love the watermelon ale. \n\nI wish they stayed open later (they close at 7 most nights apart from special events). Also, it is always HOT inside. Maybe upgrade the AC unit? \n\nThey don't do food here and that's a shame. However, the staff frequently arrange for a delicious food truck to hang out in the parking lot which helps quite a bit.
3;Went 11/28/08 (a Friday)\n\nWe had a party of eight people and went to line up at 3:25pm.  People were not exactly lined up there but just sitting around talking.  There was no organization at all..just by memory and the honor system.  I thought it might cause problems but I went with the flow.  That was a big mistake.  For some reason, there was a couple who many parties accepted to cut in front even though we got there before them (which the couple admitted to).  So we stepped in front of them in line and acknowledged that other people were in front of us as well but we were definitely in front of those guys.  What followed was a heated disagreement and bad tensions that put a big damper on the evening.  \n\nI can't believe that it was like this but my brother (who has been there 3 times) said it's like this every time.  I suggest if you go then either have someone start a list or talk with everyone to know the order right when you get there to avoid possible problems.\n\nAnyways, the rush to line up is really to get in the first seating, otherwise you will have to wait another couple of hours depending on your party size.  After they open and they get your party on their list, you can go next door to the pub and relax there and they even call you when you are up which is a big plus.\n\nAfter getting in, our party sat at the bar and could see Chris at work in his mastery.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good.  We each ordered a pizza so we could try all varieties.  My favorites were the Margherita and Wiseguy but my brother loves the Biancoverde.  The pizza was great like I heard and expected.  Worth the wait?  Yes, because I needed to test the hype and continue my quest on finding the best pizza places out there.  Best in America?  No..I can name a couple in Brooklyn that I prefer but it's top 10 taste wise for me (so far).
0;The cost of doing business\nThis location has a restroom policy in place in which between 2-4 pm they do not let high schoolers use their restrooms even if they are paying customers.\nTheir claim over vandalism, sex and drugs is absurd. The fact that they can't afford the costs is also absurd. If you own a Dairy Queen then this is the cost of doing business.
4;Excellent wax.  Always great service.  Thanks
2;Good, but not worth the price.
1;"The food was \""OK\"" for frozen, out of the bag, canned, run of the mill, heat and eat. \n\nThe description makes it sound Yummy.. but the taste doesn't backup the menu (or the price).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my gay boys, but when you're a waiter, it's not always cool to show your \""I'm a Diva\"" side when you're waiting on a table of 6 people that can either make your night with a good tip, or leave you a $1.00, which it wasn't even worth that. \n\nThe \"" I'm a diva in my real life, but I'm just playing waiter tonight\"" attitude really sets a bad tone for the night."
3;From someone that hated sushi, I've learned that's it's all in how it's prepared....Oyshi Sushi converted me into someone that can't get enough now!  The place is always busy, and the crowd is very diverse.  \n\nWaiters are good at suggesting items if you're not too sure, and the menu offerings are plentiful.  Only once did I attempt AYCE....but my stomach wouldn't allow any more after the 3rd dish. But if you can, go for it...very affordable.
0;Unfortunately I got scammed into signing up for their care contract and I am so disappointed with it. EVERY single time I go in they try to upsell me something and tell me it's not covered in the pet care visits. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made. The vet techs leave my dog smelling like cigarettes after they examine them and a couple of them act as though they don't even care. Do not bring your pets here!!
4;Came back, because I have fallen in love with this place, and will come every time I am in Vegas.  I had the quiche lorraine this time, and WOW!!!!!!  Ohhhh so amazing!! The Hubby had the blue berry waffle/pancake (can't remember) but I do remember it being amazing!! Soooooo blueberry -eeeee and made well.  They offered to send us with coffee to go!! They are the best!!
1;Nice atmosphere, good service, mediocre food at best. My advice save your money.
4;The girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant. She asked us how our weekend was going - a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience. The restaurant was very clean, which was confirmed by their 99.0 sanitation rating on the wall. Great place & we will definitely come back!
4;"The Linq is a \""mini strip\"" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April."
0;"So pumped to go here and then BAM...the worst ever. So sad. The night started off so good. 5 chicks walk up and 5 chicks get escorted to the VIP tables. Pretty freak'n awesome right? (Yes, I am one of those chicks.) An entrance like that and you have a feeling \""tonight's going to be a good night\"". Well, not so much. The music was okay but the club was really empty and this was on NYE weekend. Also, the bouncers would constantly ask you to move, not step there, don't lean against the wall, don't do this don't do that, you can't be here, and etc. To put it in perspective I had given my coat to the coat check and we were leaving to go somewhere else. I leaned down against a wall, literally right in front of coat check, to look into my mini purse to find the coat check ticket and a bouncer grabs me by my arm and says I can't bend down. I understand, he thinks I'm drunk. (I'm not in the slightest because my not has been so boring). So explain that I'm looking for the ticket and I lean again down to check my person. He says he doesn't care what I'm doing but not to do that and pulls me up. I say WOW, no problem. I find the ticket and we're out. There was one light in the tunnel; this one bouncer was the nicest, most caring guy. He saw us dancing in the VIP room and that our purses were out on the sofa, he showed us a secret drawer to put them into and placed them in there. He also shared that we were able to dance on the platforms if we wanted but wanted us to be aware of our heels on the sofa. He did this with grace and respect. Love that guy! Great employee. \nGranted we are talking about a club here but I expect to have the time of my life at a club in Vegas, especially when it is one of the newest ones in town. This club was a bust."
4;WOW!!!!!!\n\nSo glad I went here! My mother in law goes here. My husband was in NEED of a pedicure (When you start referring to the bottom of your souls looking like alligator assholes you know its time for a pedicure) Since I was dragging him to his very first pedicure I figured I would take one for the team and get one as well. \n\nThey did such a nice job! I liked how the pedicure chairs were in the back and closed off so you weren't on display to the rest of the shop. It is really nicely decorated in here. The staff is friendly enough, same language barriers as any where else. \n\nWe did the works and added the sugar scrub and also did the paraffin wax treatment, all in all with tip for two top of the line pedicures it was $100. Not to bad. \n\nI will for sure be going back! They do gels here and I really want to try those out!
1;"It's okay, but not great. If you can pick up tickets on the cheap, or if you have magic-minded children, you can have a nice hour of entertainment that will give you something to discuss later at dinner.\n\nThe difference between good and great illusions is in the subtleties. Nathan is a pretty okay magician. To be great, it would take a substantial investment in time and money in the production effort. I don't suspect that's the future here: they are going with cheap ticket prices and variations on classic illusions. It's a business choice.\n\nPlan to play \""spot the hiding space\"" a lot. Even your kids can take part in the adventure."
0;I hate to give any business a one star rating, particularly if the staff has been friendly,  but the quality of the food here is pretty bad.\n\nMe and my partner went for dinner the week before Christmas.\n\nWe were in town for a week.  This was the worst meal we had.\n\nWaiter was very enthusiastic.  There were no service problems.  The hostess out front was charming.\n\nPartner had the oysters.   He's quite the oyster eater, almost always ordering them in any seafood place.  He says they were among the worst he's had.  By and large for him it was a temperature thing.  Oysters are far better if they are really cold.  Some of his were pretty much room temperature.\n\nI had the calamari appetizer. It was piping hot, if somewhat bland.  Large chunks of calamari, in a very light and tasteless batter.\n\nHe had the fish and chips entree.  I had the bacon-wrapped scallops.\n\nHis was, as he put it, frozen Mrs. Pauls fish stick quality.  Bland.  Unfresh (if that's a word).  \n\nMy scallops were possibly the saltiest things I've ever put in my mouth.   And they had a slightly funky 'maybe they sat out all day' sortof taste.   The side vegetables were overcooked and bland.\n\nThe bathroom is pretty dirty.  A dirty bathroom in a seafood restaurant doesn't instill much confidence.\n\nI honestly wouldn't have been surprised to wake up the next day with food poisoning.\n\nDinner for two (no drinks) was around $70.  FAR too much for substandard seafood. \n\nIn a normal mall in a normal city maybe you'd just say 'eh' and consider it a lesson learned.\n\nBut this is Vegas, with literally unlimited dining choices.\n\nYou can do far, far better.  \n\nThe funny thing is, when we sat down we had an uneasy feeling about the place, so we checked the Yelp reviews.  But we didn't heed them.  Our mistake.\n\nRight down the corridor is Pampass, the Brazilian all you can eat steakhouse.  I didn't get a chance to try it, as I opted for Oyster Bay instead.  I regret that choice.  If you are reading this review outside Oyster Bay, check out Pampass instead.
1;Mediocre pizza.
3;Yum Yum Yum\n\nLove the decor and the music is fun to grooove too lol, The idea of these foods together makes a great diverse meal!\n\nMy deliciious meal:\n-The beef tenderloin and aji panca was great and it was perfectly spicy.. very juicy (not dry at all)\n-Peruvian corn :)\n-The Bobo Brazil samba roll w has seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri -- FREAKIN BOMB
0;it's Monday night and I'm on hold trying to make a group reservation (they consider 8 people a LARGE group)\nI speak direclty to someone at the restaurant and they decide they don't want to deal with me, so they tell me they're going to transfer me to group reservations. LIAR! she transfered me to Caesar's restaurant line (which I already know is unable to reserve LARGE parties.  So i'm a ping pong between the lines for about 15 minutes...ya, I even wrote this review while I waited!!! HA! A guy by the name of Brandon tells me they'll have to take my number and call me back...let's see when and IF they call me back!!!
1;"Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:\n\n*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.\n\n*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)\n\n*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!\n\n*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).\n\n*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.\n\n*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or \""Hot Fudge Cake\"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!\n\nThus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.\n\nThanksgiving Buffet $12.99/$12.49 Sr."
0;"Where do I begin? Oh yes, the bar \""losing our order\"", what a great start. \nThis was followed by the landslide. \n-Hostess takes us to a table, only to immediately take us to a \""better table\"". \n-Sit at the \""better table\"" for 20 minutes without service. \n-I go to the hostess stand to ask if we have a waiter, she apologizes and assures me a manager will be with me immediately. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes total, the manager never arrived. \n-Our second attempt at ordering drinks fell flat. Third time worked. \n-Had to stop a different waiter to get a wine menu that our waiter was coming right back with, 20 minutes earlier. \n\nTo the food:\n-3 of 4 steaks were grossly overcooked. \n-Lobster bisque was bland.\n-Salads were mediocre, at best. \n-Asparagus was good, but that's easy. \n\nIn all, everyone at the table agreed this was the worst restaurant experience any of us have had. Very disappointing as a close friend that is a major foodie described it as a \""life changing meal\"" for him. I guess technically it was for me too, just not in a good way.  I'm appalled that we spent more PER dish than an entire meal for four at the likes of Outback Steakhouse and left wishing we had gone to Outback Steakhouse. \n\nI will stick to Les Artistes Steakhouse when in Vegas. \n\nThanks for a horrible ending to our fabulous wedding day."
0;PATHETIC. This place has gone from bad to worse in a matter of months. Wish I could give you Zero stars.\n\n I decided to give 777 another chance since my review back in March. I wish that I didn't. \n\nAs I said in my prior review, the best thing here are the microbrews. Correction, the best thing about 777 WAS the microbrews. I ordered a High Roller and immediately noticed that it did not look the same. It used to be a golden color, now its more of a red/brown. \nI asked the bartender whats up with the beer and he said that they got a new brewmaster. The High Roller tasted nothing like before. The bartender said that many people have been complaining and offered to give me a different kind. I went with the Black Chip. It tasted like right (must have been an old batch before the new guy came).  \nI ordered a burger and ate it at the bar and also ordered some korean tacos to-go. A few minutes went by and I noticed that the bartender quickly swap out my bill with a new one. I looked at it and he was charging me $2 because I was taking some food to-go. WTF? The bartender said he can't do anything about it and said he can get the manager. Yes, do that I requested.\nThe manager came out and I told him that I have been coming to 777 for 15 years and and this place has fell to $hit. I told him the food prices went up considerably and the quality has never got better. I also mentioned that the beer is not the same. He said its a different color but should taste the same. What?? This guy is clueless. Get a clue and rename your beers something else, and not try to pass off $hit as diamonds to your customers. \nI finally mentioned to him about nickel and dimeing me for $2 because I wanted to take an order home. He took the $2 off but still.\n\nI am NEVER EVER COMING BACK.
3;A solid NY style pizza spot in the nondescript strip mall across the street from the Vig. It plays to the stereotype well, complete with the obligatory NY/Rat Pack memorabilia on the wall and thick Jersey accents behind the counter.  The pizza is solid but what sets it apart is the economics.  Two slices and a drink for $4 is alright  by my book.
3;Been here twice, and YUM!  The shakes are de-lish.  The turkey burger is so yummy!  So are many of the others.  If you are looking for a casual, fun, and tasty place for lunch or dinner, this is a great pic.
0;REALLY BAD!!! Service was bad and the food was bad. Servers there have no facial expression, slow on collecting finished plates. Food was just bad, their king crab legs were small like baby crab legs and very salty. Prime rib tasted like beef brisket. They did offer a glass of wine for everybody and 1 lobster per 2 persons for free, but the lobster meat was so nasty, it separated itself when we tried to stick the fork in. Only has a few types of sushi, salmon & shrimp sushi, some rolls, no sashimi, the rice was soooo hard. Dessert didn't have much choices too, worst creme brulee I've never had. Overall, the buffet doesn't worth $36 and will never go back again. So disappointed on such a high end hotel would have such a bad buffet.
0;The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!\n\nThere is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.
0;"I stayed at this hotel back in 2010 so decided to come back because of the excellent rate and first experience that we had. Our second experience of this hotel  in 2012 was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.\n\n We checked into our hotel and came to find out that the shower had little to no water pressure at all and the water temperature did not warm up. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just being crazy so I had my husband check it out as well. Low and behold it was not just me. \n\nWe called maintenance and it took them several hours to come to our room and look at it. Finally they said they could see the issue but he could not fix it and would need to call for an additional repair man. It took them an additional call and seven hours for them  to come up to our room and we had a show to attend that evening. \n\nWhen the second maintenace man came up he said that the entire side of this hotel had the same issue. Our question at that point was, if the entire side of this hotel had an ongoing water issue why did they book us in this room. \n\nWe decided to go to our nine pm show and returned later that evening. I decided to go to the front desk and speak with the night manager. She kept apologizing and saying the hotel is \""old.\"" I told her that the hotel definately might be aged but this water issue was not acceptable. I do not mind if the pressure isn't all that hard in the shower, but to have one drop coming out of the shower head is just ridiculous. \n\nThe manager said I can credit you the resort fee of $7.50 only. I just got back from Las Vegas and the hotel charged me the full amount for my stay 220.00. They did not even credit me the little $15.00 fee that they said they would. I will be calling my bank to disupte this and I will also be contacting them to fight for a credit for my one night of a non functional bathroom. \n\nWe will never be returning to this hotel ever again! Is it to much to ask that we are able to take an actual shower?"
1;I am using my Groupon for this place and its not a great start. We were left standing at the  front door for a good 5 minutes. My pet peeve is that they see u standing there but wont say anything!!! WTH Come on people a simple we'll be right you goes a long way. I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll pass
0;"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I paid $40 dollars to see her for probably less than five minutes which gave me no time to explain my skin problems at all. As someone with severe adult acne this is not the place to go to seek understanding about your ailment or any type of supportive or caring \""bedside\"" manner. Literally anywhere would be better than this overcrowded and perpetually behind center."
1;What a difference!\nVisited Haulin' Balls while at the Tivoli Village Food Truck Throwdown, since I hadn't had any Zorba balls in so long:/\nThere was really no line. Ordering process went smooth, they added free fries for checking in on Yelp. I unfortunately tipped them prematurely.\nI waited and waited and waited til I saw someone that was behind me in line get their food. My husband inquired about my order and they told him they didn't have any Zorba's. What!? Okay I want my $$ back. The guy that took my order heard the conversation and apologized and cleared things up, I wasn't willing to wait any longer so I said forget it and that I still wanted my $ back. The woman serving the food was apologetic as well, said she'd give me my money back and get a Zorba to me as well if I was willing to wait 1 minute. So I got my $6 back. Never got my free fries, they got $1 tip for wasting my time.\n They were very nice to give me a Zorba, it did take 1 minute but somehow it was cold.
2;Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick.
0;Worst BBQ I think I have ever had and an empty restaurant should have been a clue. Brisket was not brisket, tasted more like roast beef. Won't be returning.
0;Our first visit was a five:\nWe came across this place by accident but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. My husband had the silver city sub which is an Italian style sub, which he said was one of the best he has ever had. I had there home stake which was really good as well.\n\nOur last visit would be !/2 a star:\nService was very slow and the sandwiches were not very good at all we should have gone to Jimmy Johns down the street. We wont be going back!
2;"It's cheap, the margaritas are huge, they serve breakfast tacos all day (proper breakfast tacos, not Taco Bell's waffle nonsense), and you can sit on the patio with a giant drink and a plate of breakfast tacos, feeling vaguely like an expatriate who ought to be listening to Mexican radio. It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)\n\nIt's a \""scene\"" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.\n\nThe breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).\n\nAs far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood."
1;I have been to the Tanning room 3 times now and have had an extremely pleasant experience. \n\nThe two younger ladies who are usually there are very helpful and somewhat friendly. Although there is an older gentleman who is not friendly in fact rude. \n\nThe rates are above average but not by much maybe .50 to 1.00 more per session than the competition. \n\nOverall I will probably use the remainder of my sessions and move on.
1;All hype.  Badly executed food.  Coffee is weak.  Food was all cold.  The potatoes were just like the ones they used to deep fry at my grade school cafeteria, were underseasoned and tasted even worse cold.  Hash, which if it's in the place's name you'd think would be good, was big but tasted so boring I almost went back to sleep.  The spongy vanilla waffle was exactly like eating a twinkie without the cream filling.  I hate twinkies and think their only redeeming quality is the cream filling.   Oddly enough, the bacon was just plain old thin sliced bacon...cold.\n\nService was good, noise level was insane, wait wasn't bad at 20 minutes.
1;I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.
4;I have been wanting to come here for a few weeks and was finally in the area and in need of lunch. I will admit I wanted a smoked bourbon. I knew going in it might be a gimmick to get people interested in the place and it worked on me. \n\nWe were seated by the bar at a high top table. It was a few min before our waiter came out and brought waters without me having to ask. This was very nice. He also later brought out a glass bottle of water for the table. Loved this!!! I ordered my smoked bourbon. There is a nice long list of options. I chose a blackberry house bourbon with cherry wood and made sure to ask for them to make it on my side of the bar. It is definitely a fun drink to watch being made. It was finished with a large ice cube and an orange peel. This might have been my favorite drink EVER. Even more then my beloved Samos Nectar. \n\nFor my entree I chose the Worker Burgher. It was delish. The goat cheese with the caramelized onion was perfect. The fries were just ok. They didn't have much of a crunch and were over salted. I can say they were definitely fresh though. \n\nI must give a shout out to our server who was excellent. I've been disappointed with service lately and he restored my faith.  Also I could see the kitchen window and they have a designated expediter. This was nice and I never just saw food sitting in the window. I find it hard to justify going to a restaurant more then once when I'm going out because there are so many great options in the Burgh but this is a place I wouldn't think twice about coming back to.
4;Second trip to Downtown Tattoo - Buddy hooked us up and fixed our tats. Super guy who stands by his shop and the people he has working there. \n\nHappy to say the next time we're back in Vegas, this is the only place we will get our tattoos!
1;With all the hype, I expected better. The fried green tomato appetizer had a lot of potential, but the tomatoes were overripe and mushy. The batter was good and the horseradish dill sauce was fantastic, but nothing could make the mushy tomato great. \n\nSoup of the day was mashed cauliflower, and while it was not refined, it was pretty good. It at least had some cheesy flavor. \n\nThe veggie burger made of chickpeas was also limp and mushy with no flavor in itself. The southwestern toppings (guacamole, salsa, jalape\u00f1os, pepper jack) made it edible, but nothing special. \n\nMashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty, not creamy at all. Mac and cheese was as generic as possible. Couldn't tell if the green beans were canned or fresh, but they were also bland. Nothing great about the biscuit. \n\nGrilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring.\n\nOverall, pretty disappointing.
1;I'm an out of towner so maybe I'm used to a different kind of pizza.  I use Yelp almost exclusively to decide on the fly what to order and more importantly where to order when I'm out of town, so there is an element of trust that I've grown used to .  I was visiting relatives in the El Mirage area and they live here 2-3 months out of the year and they said Mario's was good based on word of mouth from their friends. Seemed like a slam dunk to phone in an order, pick it up and be grubbing shortly thereafter.  Service was great during pickup. The pizzas was some of the worst we've had when we got home. There was no delay in eating them. The pizzas lacked proper amounts of toppings, had limp crust and generally didn't look good.  I usually leave good reviews on Yelp as I'd rather say good then bad but this pizza just isn't recommended.
1;Not a lot of selection. The food sucks.
1;"This is a hard review to write. So I'll need to rate it on several different criteria:\n\nThe good:\nHotel lobby & rooms: very beautiful, spacious and well appointed. Our family of 4 enjoyed the layout. Very much like an upgraded embassy suites - which works great for a family of 4! The valet people couldn't have been nicer.\n\nOn-site Water park - yay! 2 tall slides, a lower loopy slide (my fave) a lazy river and a wave pool. Free towels, plenty of shade, and decent chair service. Plus a good amount of self serve icy water. Very appreciated. Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.\n\nThe bad\nThey are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting.\n- Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare\n- They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!! Both nights!! Posted times were open weekly until 9:30.\n- you are charged a $40.00 resort fee per suite that covers a bunch of stuff you don't need, but includes 2 good items: free wifi (although it's slow) and free water park admission. So it's a wash for me. I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.\n\nThe ugly\nI was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.\n\nWhen I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said \""well yeah, they leave if it's dead\"".\n\nThe cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, and both were marginal at best.\n\nIf you have kids, stay here. But don't eat here (it's really overpriced for crappy food). And do use the coupons they give you!"
1;"I stopped into the PBR Rock Bar on Sunday late afternoon to catch a hockey game and a bite to eat before making the drive back to LA.  I got there around 5 and found a seat at the bar in front of a TV that was playing the local news.  The two bartenders basically ignored me for a good 5-7 minutes.  They both seemed pretty bored and miserable, but at least one of them was hustling, so I respected that at least.  When one finally came over, I asked if they would turn the game on, because I did not want to order anything if they could not.  She said 'sure let me find out'.  A few minutes later the other bartender noticed me, and asked if she could 'help me'.  I said that I was waiting to see if I would be able to get the hockey game on.  She replied with \""no we can't do that.\""  I was up and out of my chair, and it is a good thing the manager showed up then to turn the game on for me, otherwise I was gone and this review would have been much worse.  The manager accommodated me, but also seemed like she did not want to be bothered. \n\nThe food was typical and pretty unmemorable.  I was debating between the buffalo chicken sandwich and the BBQ Cheddar Chicken Sandwich, so I asked the bartenders opinion (as usual), and she recommended the former, so I gave it a shot.  I had finally gotten her to lighten up and be a little friendly by this point by being the nice affable guy I am.  The sandwich consisted of frozen chicken dropped in a deep fryer and coated in buffalo sauce with toppings.  It arrived with the chicken half off of the bun with everything falling off of it.  It was not the most appetizing. I fixed it the best I could and some bites were pretty good with the crumbled bleu cheese nicely complimenting the buffalo sauce.  Mostly though, I was unimpressed.\n\nThe mechanical bull looked fun, but I was honestly a little turned off by the initial service and food. \nThe patio looked pretty cool though and I would return for drinks and to hang out there if people were staying at Planet Hollywood, but I would not go out of my way to come back."
1;"This upscale restaurant incongruously also serves as a video poker bar. We were one of the first through doors at 10AM for the recently introduced Sunday-only brunch. We were greeted at the door and seated at a table for four. I ordered eggs Benedict Oscar style - described as \""jumbo\"" crab cakes on English muffins topped with 2 poached eggs and Bearnaise sauce with sides of grilled asparagus and thick bacon. The only thing \""jumbo\"" was the price tag because the crab cakes were not much thicker than my little finger. \n\nMy wife chose pain perdu - walnut -raisin French toast with espresso anglaise and whipped cream served with a pair of breakfast sausages. Another pretty ordinary entree. Our server never reappeared at our table after taking our orders and we noticed every other table received complimentary snifters of champagne. Needless to say, her gratuity was comparable to the level of service provided.\n\nA rating of 2.5 seems most appropriate."
2;Was in the area today and had lunch with a colleague here.  I ordered the 12 Piece Chicken Nachos.\n\nThey were very good.  I thought the proportion of all of the toppings on each chip was perfect.  The portion was good, I wasn't too full and not left hungry.  The Salsa was too weak for my tastes and the Jalapenos weren't spicy at all.  If I could change two things it would be to offer a spicier Salsa option and offer a spicier Jalapeno option.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.
2;Tried this place for the first time tonight. I really enjoyed the key lime pie's creaminess and the crust was awesome. The blueberry fruit pie I got for my wife had a good crust but the filling itself was average. I might return to this shop to try some of the other pies but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
0;Run away. \n\nEvery sleazy stereotype of a car sales can be found at this location. Lies, manipulation, deception, and fast talking b.s. are all on the menu and served fresh daily. \n\nWalked away, nay ... ran, and never looked back.
4;"Lalibela is definitely an establishment for food connoisseurs; so if you unfortunately happen to be a good ol' fashioned American (gosh darn it!), requiring your plate of food super-saturated with salt, submerged in boiling lard, priorly frozen, served in a bag, or lacking any sort of flavor other than greasy; then this is not the place for you: for all others, a must. \n\nWE recommend getting one of the three-combination plates (the vegetarian or the MEAT are both excellent) during lunch hours, only $7.99; and it comes with a free fountain drink. Plus, you must try Injera (Ethiopian flat bread). Also as a side note, their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food. \n\nWhat will it taste like may you ask? Think of this, imagine for a second that if it was at all possible for a plate of delicious Indian cuisine to somehow mange reproduction with a full-of-flavor-and-spice plate of Persian cuisine with the ending result a sexy Ethiopian platter of food baby. And there it is--in your mouth."
2;Food was just ok. Nothing special about it. Service was ok. Server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes, until I reminded him. Also waited a while for the check. Would have been 2 stars, but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us.
2;"It was a convenient walk over from the FireSky hotel across the street. We started with the green pork chili. It was tasty, but not hot. We also had the lamb fondue, which is lamb rack with a squash sauce to dip them in. The squash \""fondue\"" part was quite tasty. The lamb was cooked well.\n\nFor the main course I tried the braised short rib. It was really big. It didn't have a ton of flavour; a shame for such a tasty meat. It needed salt & pepper and the core seasoning just didn't stand out.\n\nThe food is good, but I feel it's all a bit under seasoned. Everything (except the lamb fondue) could have had some extra punch to it. Still, it wasn't so bad that you feel ripped off, so I'm going 3 stars on this."
0;Pretty bad. Both the wife's and my steaks were over cooked. Mine was well done (ordered rare) and hers was well (from a medium order). The waiter told us it was the lighting before finally conceding. The two tables next to us sent their food back too. Waiter reached across wife and forked her steak to put on a plate to take back... Not top tier service by any means. \n\nManager offered us a side dish as an apology... We declined. So much for a special dinner. The one and only time Flemings has messed up a steak they comp'd.  But that's probably because it's so rare that it happens there, clearly not the case at Chris's. Pretty sad, nowhere near the hype. For $100/ea (no drinks) I'd expect better service and better quality food.
1;"This was on graduation weekend and mother's day, so I am cutting them a little slack since they were busy.\n\nWe were able to get reservations for my wife's mom and decided it would be a great idea to take her out on mother's day. When we first got there it was pretty packed, it took five minutes before anyone at the counter acknowledge us.\n\nThey sat us down in a booth and an older waitress asked what we would like to drink, we ordered three cocktails and she asked us if we were in a hurry? No we are not, but thanks for asking...The drinks took ten minutes to come out, apparently we should have said we were in a hurry. \n\nFor the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom, both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall. The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there, we had numerous other waiters/waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn't.\n\nFor entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined \""Double Cut\"" Pork Chops, wait times were roughly 25-30mins. We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops, until my wife cut her pork chop open. The center of it was medium rare, borderline rare. Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms, the waitress even commented and took it all back. They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back, the meal was above average and we enjoyed it.\n\nNow I normally would let this slip, but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry. I guess the waitress isn't aware of this because she was the one to first point it out. If this is the case, it should be stated on the menu, totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn't really a legitimate apology. The manager there needs etiquette training, you do not act snooty like that to customers.\n\nThe desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect. It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience, but hardly a reason to return only for that.\n\nOverall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there, they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat. The location they are located it is a little bizarre, as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down. For what we paid around $150ish and we did tip *More then we should have*, we did not get our moneys worth.\n\nI can't recommend Silvercreek for the service, location, and price. You will find better places to eat in the area."
4;Just got my brows and lip done and all I have to say is wow!! Totally professional environment and so modern inside. I have really weird shaped eyebrows that pose a challenge for many estheticians but they were shaped perfectly here. My esthetician (forgot her name I'm sorry) even showed me how to correctly fill them in afterward. Reasonably priced for such a great job!
1;I was very excited to find Peking Duck highlighted on the front of this restaurant as I walked by.   A few days later I called ahead to ensure they had time to prepare properly.  With great anticipation I arrived to discover very poor approximation of the real thing.    The skin was not separated from a large layer of fat (yuk!), meat was overcooked, pancakes were thick and incorrect.    Maybe some of the other dishes are good (I didn't try any), but the Peking Duck ... bu hao chi!
4;Great lunch, quick subs and as unhealthy as you can get, but WAY WAY WAY better than that dump Philly Cheesesteak was! Talk about nasty. Big B's is great quality, decent prices, and an awesome after hours hang out!
2;This airport doesn't have a lot of good food options, but would consider this place one of the better options if you have some time to kill.  Typical airport prices and okay bar food, but good service.
2;Food was ok. Really cool concept, but menu is all over the place. It's bbq meets seafood meets sandwiches. I opted for the burger and fries.. My burger was burnt, if we weren't in a hurry to get back home, I would have sent it back. Fries were good. My hubs had the pulled pork sandwich sans slaw and he said it was good, but didn't finish it. Food is a little on the pricey side. It set us back 40$ for 2 sandwiches and two side salads.
2;"You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. \n\nThen they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.\n\nMy friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. \n\nThe menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. \n\nThe portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were \""normal\"" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. \n\n*I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino."
4;I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean.
3;"wow...there are so many mixed reviews about this place...about hipster this and hipster that...so I was a little weary about going...thinking I would be annoyed. But I don't care as long as people are nice.\nAnywho...we were tired of The Strip scene in vegas and wanted to venture out a bit to have a merry christmas\nfirst I called to make sure the place was open...I call and ask how late they are open til (it's xmas night) and the girl on the other end says....\""whenever you stop drinking.\"" I was like, um yeah, my kind of place.\nthis place was so laid back, the ambiance was great...the guys sitting next to us were complete gents. the girls I ran into in the bathroom were sweet and not catty at all.\nthe bartender was great, drinks were reasonable.\nIt's a great place to just go have a drink and conversation with your homie-lover-friend.\n\nxoxo"
2;I've been to the gardens 3 times and that's why I'm giving it an overall 3 rating, my experiences were very different.\n\nOriginally, I attended in the spring a couple years ago, during the week, but during the butterfly exhibit.  At this time I think it cost $7 to enter the gardens.  It was a nice visit, calm and beautiful.\n\nMy second visit was during the luminarias (sp?) at Christmas time.  It helps that I had free passes, but this was a great visit as well.  Beautiful to see the gardens as night and wander, quite romantic.  The musical stops were pleasant and the wine samplings excellent.\n\nMy third visit this week disappointed me.  While the Chihuly exhibit is interesting, the crowd it attracts makes it more of a disappointment than a pleasure for me.  Many people there only for the glass who were disrespectful of those pausing to see the plants, being loud, and lots of misbehaving children who would rather be somewhere made for children.  Also, the gardens are now $15 + $3 to see the butterfly exhibit.  That's getting a little crazy.  Make sure you get online and get a coupon.  \n\nOverall, the gardens will always be a place I take my parents when they are in town.  But I'll look for a slower time to attend.
4;Being from St. Louis and having Ted Drews and Bobby's custard finding the is gem for yummy custard in Arizona  is awesome. \nThis location is walking distance to my house and always friendly service. Will make this a weekly treat stop. I can't say much for the food since were not really burger and fry types. But the custard is worth the trip.
4;This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the whole city! Due to its popularity there is usually a bit of a wait for dinner, so be prepared. When we go we usually get the pad see ew, fried rice, pad won sen or any of the curries. I'm not a big fan of their soups but everything else on the menu has not been a disappointment.
1;I'm not quite sure why people love this place. Food is pretty expensive, but at least it tastes fine.  \n\nProbably the worst part of the meal came because we tried to get there early.  It was almost 95+ degrees in dry Las Vegas at 11:15 AM, but the misting fans that were on the outside patio didn't come on till noon.   Really guys?  You don't have control over your own fans?  Take them off the timer, seriously...\n\nAt least the servers were on top of refilling water, but that's only because we were dying on the patio during the summer time heat.\n\nMaybe just come for dessert?  Chances are you'll be drunk and won't want to walk to Caesar's Palace though...\n\nMight as well skip it, and just lie to your friends who didn't Vegas with you (and say it was whatever).
2;Decent sushi, but on the expensive side since the portions were a bit skimpy. Would be all right for happy hour, but was a bit much for a dinner. The sushi was good, if a bit inconsistent. The tempura was perfectly done, as was the batter. The salmon rolls were average, the Yellowtail tuna rolls were bleh (says hubby), the cinco de drinko rolls were awesome, but the sauce they drizzled over them way way too heavy for such delicious fish. The coconut martini was good, but a bit on the pricey side. The beef sashimi was good, but too peppery for my taste.
4;This is the best shabu shabu I ever had. If you wanna try the real Japanese hot pot, this is the right place. They serve food quickly and the lady working there is very nice. And the Kobe rib eye!! Yummy yummy..My favorite! Definitely wanna come back again and try the sukiyaki this time!
3;Lo-Lo's is the ultimate chicken and waffle spot..not only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeat..as you watch TV and listen to some music that will make you want to eat
0;What an unforgettable time visiting the Excalibur. First, I went there because we were looking for a pasta meal and their website advertised that they had a Buca di Beppo, which we love. Got there, only to discover, after much hunting, that the restaurant had not opened yet and the person we were able to find to assist us, after much searching, couldn't have cared less. At that point we decided to head over to Mandalay Bay to eat.  Of course, the easiest way to get to that other property is to take their monorail.  We could find no signs directing us to the place to board and, literally, saw no employees that we could ask at all. Overall, a pitiful experience not worth repeating. Plenty of other properties on the strip to give business to. Time to implode this dump anyway.
4;This is my third cirque show(mystere and zarkana), this was by far the best!! Seriously, air acrobats plus diving.... Absolutely amazing. Very expensive, but definitely worth the price.  Great vegas show!
4;Best pizza in Arizona. Arizona had been waiting for this for a long time!!  We were customers in IL and the owners have kept up the exact same quality and service!!  We didn't want to move back to IL to have great pizza!!!  Thank you Buzzyz for always delivering a superior product.
0;I don't think I've had such a awful experience at any restaurant  in my life. Mind you this happened on my birthday. I go to order some wings to go and while I wait I decide to grab a drink. Well at the end of my drink I notice in the corner of my eye something brown in my drink and to my surprise I find a dead roach in my drink. It was the most disgusting feeling I've ever felt. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I'm to the point I don't even wanna eat at any restaurant  again. Such a awful experience be aware of this place
0;If you want a good breakfast in Phoenix don't go to the Oink Cafe. Go to the Butterfield Restaurant on 7388 E. Shea Blvd in Scottsdale, AZ about seven minutes away.  Had breakfast at the Oink Cafe got lousy service,  greasy link sausages and hash browns,  and mmisoma made with cheap Cupcake champagne. I had ordered patties sausages and got links. My wife ordered mmisoma so I asked for one too. Lucky the server forgot mines. My wife had barely drunk hers and offered me to taste it. The mmisoma was bitter due to the champagne. The server brought us our bill, first time returning after bringing our breakfast. I told her about the sausage, hash browns, mmisoma, etc. She spoke with her manager and took 10% off the bill. That was a joke! It was coded military/senior. I'll over 60 and look every bit. I was already entitled to a 10% discount. Just go to Butterfield Restaurant for a superb breakfast and fantastic service.
4;Well once again Penny came thru like the pro she is. Brought Piewacket in for a bath and major trimming today and my long hair kitty is loving life again. She gets really pissy when she needs to be groomed. Thanks Penny love you.
3;What a pleasant surprise.  I selected PCG for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal, atmosphere and service. I tried the plank salmon which was wonderful.  Two of us had meals that included the mashed potatoes with horseradish and agreed the flavor was excellent.  I admit that as I approached the strip center on 16th street I wondered if I had made a mistake, only to be rewarded by my guests with compliments for the choice. I will return.
4;"I was new to vaping and actually asked my wife to go in to the store (since we live closeby) and pick up some juice. The staff was very helpful and educated her on the product so she would understand what it was she actually was buying for me - I've been back and would consider myself a regular now - I buy my juice there (FlavorZ by Joe - CoolPort) and have also been getting my hardware there - Although I'm a tech nut, I'm kinda done with the internet shops - I've had some bad experiences - So I prefer to spend a few bucks more and visit a local store where the advise is instant, free and delivered with a smile. I suggest stopping in and giving them a try - Nice shop, clean and in a neighborhood where you can feel safe parking your car ;-)"
2;After having such a horrible experience at Babystacks (see prior review), my friend and I drove over to Lulu's. I don't know if it was the contrast to the poor service we just experienced but it was so nice to have such good service.  Although  you order at the counter, you can sit in the Metro pizza area which is easier with kids. Also, they brought out drinks over to us, which again helps with kids. They didn't bat an eye when my friend sent her egg back because she forgot to ask for it to be over hard instead of over easy as it normally comes. The manager is always nice and has gone out of her way to make us feel welcome before. \n\n I had the Herman breakfast sandwich, a little pricey (about $8 if I remember correctly), but I love that it comes on a pretzel bun and it is surprisingly filling for just being a sandwich. It is just the sandwich with egg, sausage, cheese and a stone ground mustard. \n\nI have had the chocolate croissant before and it was okay - but of course I am a chocolate croissant aficionado (aka snob) and really only like the traditional french chocolate croissant (as served at Patisserie Manon and the Baguette Cafe). The lemon tart is really good and reminds me of a sour cream lemon pie my hubby makes which is phenomenal. They usually have cookie and muffin samples out which is nice.
3;This was my first time going to a restaurant that offered really healthy dishes and foods of this scale. I came in here not knowing what to expect. It's a cute place with nice, fresh decorations! The cashiers were really nice and easy to talk to - they explained thoroughly any foods and drinks I had questions about. Though it is pricey, the quality of the food does show.\n\nI got the summer berry salad, which consists of berries, spinach, goat cheese, and raspberry vinaigrette. The ingredients were really fresh! Some of the berries are REALLY sweet by themselves, but the taste can be easily toned down if you eat the spinach and goat cheese with it in one bite. The contents of the salad worked harmoniously with themselves!\n\nI also got the white chocolate veggiechino, which is their healthier version of the frappucino. I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no! It was pleasantly sweet, even with all the greens they put in there. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks frappucinos at all, which was very nice.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't mind coming here again. Maybe next time I'll try the Thai peanut chicken satays.
1;Really loud music...\nSam Adams is a big plus...\nStaff was unfriendly.
0;"STATE BOARD OF COSMETOLOGY NEEDS TO VISIT! RED FLAGS! BEWARE!\nThis place has the appearance of a nice clean and well kept salon.  I have been a few times but NEVER AGAIN.\n\nShort Massage: They offer a menu w/ a break down of what the service includes.  I always felt like the massage was much shorter so on my last visit I decided to time it w/ the stop watch on my iPhone.  It was half as long as it should have been but they charge you for it.  Make sure you are getting what you are paying for if you go for an upgraded pedicure.\n\nReckless: Very aggressive w/ the metal cheese grater looking tool they use on everyone's feet.  There is a more gentle way of getting the dead skin off of your feet ladies.  This rough and aggressive approach is very dangerous.  \n\nCuticles: They cut the cuticles way to close to the skin which isn't necessary.  Your cuticles are there for a reason. Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection.  You should just get your cuticles pushed back but not cut off.\n\nSanitation: They bring the tools out in what looks like a \""sterile bag\"" that a hospital would keep scalpels in.  They open the bag in front of you which is a false sense on security because my guy placed the instruments back into the bag and pinched the end closed when he was done w/ my pedicure.  I don't know what he did with the tools after that? Did he bring the same tools out of that bag for the next person without sanitizing them properly? Were they clean when he peeled the bag open for me? The bag looks clean but I am curious if they just slide dirty instruments back into a \""sterile looking\"" bag so it looks clean to a new customer?\n\nDirty Bowl: I got a manicure and the lady grabbed a bowl from under the sink and filled it with warm water.  I soaked my fingers in the bowl which had glass stones in the bottom.  She cut my natural nails so SHORT! I wanted to keep the length and just wanted them evened up...to late for that since she clipped the first two so short  without asking how I wanted them.  When she finished the manicure she went to the sink, put her hands on the stones to keep them in the bowl, and then dumped the water down the drain.  Then she put the bowl w/ stones back under the sink.  I am suspecting they don't sanitize the bowl or stones between manicures and just store it under the sink.  The thought of someone else's cuticles and nail clippings in the stones is disgusting! \n\nThey are very pushy with the upgrades for gel nails, nail art, waxing, deluxe pedicures etc... Beware if you go here.  You may be at risk of an infection.\n\nhttp://cosmetology.nv.gov/Consumers/Nail_Salon_Guide"
4;"I Love the 1 star reviews--Comedy! \""My NY Steak was less than 1/2\"" thick..\""(doubt it) or \""I had to park ONE HUNDRED yards away...\"" (exercise) or \""our table was so BIG!...\"" (I hate elbow room, so I will complain and go back to waiting for a smaller table)\nOur visit was great, also $25 off for your birthday is AMAZING! My wife's birthday was 2 days before mine so our server brought us a huge piece of Kona ice cream cake for her. Hope you can filter though the dum-dum reviews, this is a nice place Our 10 oz Filet was cooked to perfection and the King Crab was great. Order the crab cakes, split the dinner meal (with salad/grilled veggies/mashed potatoes), and enjoy your date night. \nPS, the Blueberry Mule cocktail is addicting."
0;This place is pretty much fast food bbq.  I don't mind kitsch if the substance is there but the food here was inedible.  I ordered the brisket sandwich, potato salad (I love a good potato salad) and beans.  To my dismay the beans were not BBQ beans (something I would expect from a BBQ place) but were pork and bean style with shreds of pork. They added pepper to the beans, A LOT of pepper.  Matter of fact everything seemed to have a lot of pepper.  I would equivalent the potato salad to any store bought brand- sort of slimy, sort of rubbery.  The brisket was dry, but I did go there late so I can understand that.  Other people who were with me ordered the pork sandwich, which I shared, and I could not even bring myself to eat it.  The pulled pork looked more like mush than anything else.  Simply unappetizing.  Other things order were the coleslaw, which was not eaten and the pork ribs- which were so so.\n\nOverall a pretty awful experience. I cant believe how many stars people are giving this place.
2;I came here for lunch on Sunday and for some reason they did not have any crab legs.  How can you not serve crab legs??\n\nEvery time I go to a buffet, I must eat the prime rib.  And their prime rib was OK.  A few things that stood out were the lobster ravioli, shrimp and peso pizza, and the french toast station.  They have a big dessert section.  But no cones for ice cream!
3;Great Burger. \n\nWent on Memorial Day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. We were able to grab two seats at the bar.  I wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. I got the brown cow float. It was lighter and he still had to help me with it! It was so good. I love a good root beer float. I could taste the booze.\n\nWe both ordered burgers. He added an egg to the steakhouse burger. I got the funghi. Both cooked perfectly. They were delicious. Generous portions. The fries were ok but the burger was so big. Truffle flavor was there and the Gruyere was perfectly melted. It was a more refined mushroom and Swiss burger. In a good way. The fries were just ok. A place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. However props to including them in the price of the burger.\n\nWe got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. BF said the cocktail he has was well executed. \n\nWe will be back and next time I will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.
2;Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!
3;Great happy hour.  We come here on our Tuesday veggies-and-booze night when we pick up our CSA.  I think their happy hour is five items for $6 each until 7:00.  There are also some cocktails and wine.  One of those five items is their burger which you can order rare plus, it comes out perfect this way.  Nice and creamy (instead of dry and chewy), full of flavor and juicy with nice thick pieces of bacon on it.  This might be our new favorite.
0;"I suppose when I saw the \""bigeye tuna pizza\"" as being the best dish at this restaurant I should have figured it would be subpar sushi joint.  I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews but I guess with Vegas being a big tourist area most people reviewing this place have no clue what good sushi tastes like...especially a reviewer that states there is no place better in California!!? I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:\n\nService:\nSucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.  \n\nSushi:\nWe tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.\n\nAmbiance:\nI kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site \""patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot\"" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.\n\nSummary:\nA white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi. I have to give it one star of the cost of food and not meeting our expectations."
1;"This Buffet has definitely gone down hill.  We used to wait in line for 1 - 2 hours, but that was ok because the food was worth it.  Today, our seafood options were disappointingly limited; and it looks like most food was cooked hours ago.  They ran out of crab stuffed sole (and never refilled).  The chicken (American) was very dry.  Nothing exciting in the Mexican section.  Pizza was ok, but sub par for a brick oven style.  The only benefit is I had a groupon for buy one get one free.  If I am going to a Buffet (once/year) - then I would rather spend more money on better food."
3;My husband and I stayed here in February 2012 for USA Sevens. We picked it because it was on the strip and was better priced and looked the cleanest then the other hotels. We stayed in the East tower , which I do recommend staying at because it's the newest part of the Luxor and the cleanest. The ONLY thing we really couldn't stand was how far the parking lot is to the tower. Between going through the entire casino, bars, and the whole pyramid to the other side it was horrible after a 9 hour drive with a bunch of luggage! The room it self was really nice, the desk chair was a bit dirty . But all in all we would stay there again. The Luxor buffet was the best one we've been to compared to a few others on the strip. It was clean and had great options for breakfast.
4;I absolutely love this place. I have been twice and Katie (bar manager) has been my server both times...she is great! She recommended the bacon/Squash flatbread and it was outstanding! The wine was great, and even greater on HH (which, btw their HH is from open to 6pm M-S. They are not open before 3pm though, so don't try going here for lunch...it's a chill, nighttime place to bring dates or close friends/family members.\n\nOn weekends, there is always an acoustic musician playing. I have experienced Blaine Long and Notes from Neptune. Both phenomenal. \n\nLong story short...if you read my reviews you know I like chill spots with great lighting and patios. This is another one of those....I will be back for a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc time.\n\n:)
3;I went there for my wife bday dinner, with a group of 12. I was a bit worried after reading the negative reviews. I am happy to say that I had a great experience..\n\nIts supposed to be classy italian place and may get busy at nite with the byob..All depends on your luck. I was there on a saturday nite and the place was packed with decent crowd. \n\nKeep in mind its an Italian place so be smart and order something italian.\nMenu wise they have a great choice of  pasta and steak options...I took the Italian sausage pasta and it turns out to be one of the best.  The week before i was a t L'Academie  with the same group. so it was easy to compare. And group found their food is better than L'Academie. \n \nWe had one main waiter and 2 others helping him and they were always around for help. Food showed up in 20-30 mins and I will definitely recommend to everyone...\n\nI choose this place because i have been to other Italian places in west with the same group So decided to give a try. \n\nWill definitely go back and recommend to others based on my experience.\n\nPT
1;"Je note un peu s\u00e9v\u00e8rement, mais c'est parce que mes attentes \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s hautes, compte tenu de la r\u00e9putation  tr\u00e8s enviable du Comptoir, notamment aupr\u00e8s de mes amis.\n\nLe staff est tr\u00e8s gentil, la carte des vins est \""int\u00e9ressante\"" mais c'est surtout des \""petits vins\"", des vins natures, des vins bio, des petites appellations. C'est correct mais il faut pas s'attendre \u00e0 trouver des gros crus ou beaucoup de vins \""costauds\"". Le hic, c'est le prix. Trop cher pour des vins de cette gamme, mais c'est un probl\u00e8me r\u00e9pandu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, bref, j'aurais aim\u00e9 une carte moins convenue \u00e0 cette pseudo-mode p\u00e9dante et faussement originale qui semble contamin\u00e9e tous les bars \u00e0 vins. Ton vin obscur de la Loire, tu le payes 15$ et tu me le vends 55$.\n\nLa bouffe: Quand ta sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 c'est les charcuteries, ton assiette de charcuterie doit absolument \u00eatre au rendez-vous, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Assiette minuscule. Produits corrects... mais come on, je veux des charcuteries et je suis un ogre!!! Bref, c'est beaucoup trop timide pour moi vos 4 tranches de saucissons d'un millim\u00e8tre servis sur une planche g\u00e9ante.\n\nLe Carpaccio de thon \u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s bon, servi avec des l\u00e9gumes vinaigr\u00e9s qui masquaient le thon finalement. Le coq cuit sous-vide \u00e9tait bien meilleur. Cuisson parfaite, belle texture, et bon assaisonnement. Les portions sont \u00e9galement \u00e0 revoir. On mange ou on picosse?\n\nDe mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la cuisine manque un peu de passion. trop pr\u00e9cis, trop organis\u00e9, trop carr\u00e9. Pas mon genre du tout. On voit que les cuisiniers se forcent et sont s\u00e9rieux, mais quelque part c'est triste. Tout est retenu, calcul\u00e9, pes\u00e9, minut\u00e9. \u00c7a fait plus horlogerie que restaurant. Autre truc cocasse, chaque plat est d\u00e9crit en long et en large, dans un style compl\u00e8tement exag\u00e9r\u00e9. Du genre Carpaccio de thon servi avec son ketchup maison de tomates vertes biologiques sur salade de jeunes roquettes et biscotti aromatis\u00e9 au thym de ma grand-maman, blablabla. Tout est effectivement dans l'assiette o\u00f9 se trouve 1 gramme de chacun de ingr\u00e9dients. Le contraste entre la longueur des noms des plats et la tr\u00e8s petitesse de ceux-ci \u00e0 quelque chose de vraiment ridicule. Est-ce qu'on me prend pour un clown? \n\nUn autre irritant est le manque d'espace au bar. Oubliez l'id\u00e9e d'y manger si vous faites plus de 160 lbs, ce qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s gros finalement.

0;During a walk through the mall I noticed the Dollheads salon and thought it would be fun to try hair extensions.  The wash and blow out were fine, then we started with the extensions.  I was offered a choice of 18 or 21 inch.  I chose the 21's and my hair was styled.  It was not how I normally wear it, but it was cute.  It took a bit of getting used to.  Note that during this process I was never told the price of the extensions.  I figured it might be around $300, but certainly not the total I was presented with at the end - $1300.00!  Um, wow!  I paid because I had an event to attend, and chalked it up to experience.  The next day I was in the Fashion Show Mall with a friend getting sparkle strands threaded through her hair.  The station had the exact same extensions (brand name and length) as Dollheads.  The kiosk woman noticed my extensions and asked where I had gotten them, and for how much.  I was embarrassed, so I didn't say, and instead asked her how much they were here.  She said $300 - ugh, I felt terrible that I had been oversold by so much!  I sent an email/web comment to the Dollheads salon to address the situation, and never received a response.  Be aware, you can get a better price on the exact same extensions!
1;I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls.
3;So, after hearing about Delux from co-workers and Yelp, I had to try it.\n\nGetting there early helps, because the restaurant gets packed quickly. \n\nFirst off, the place is ultra chic. A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.\n\nBut enough about the lighting, onto the food!\n\nI got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well. \n\nJuice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.\n\nMy fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.\n\nTheir fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.\n\nTheir beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.\n\nThe prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality\n\nOn a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people.
1;Pathetic. $10 just to view Ferraris that are roped off?  They could have done this in a more friendly way, perhaps at least allowing some reasonable viewing from the outside and through the glass.  The Ferrari dealer here in AZ has about the same selection and you can get as close to you want and browse on Sundays when the salesmen are not there.  What a disappointment!
4;I contacted Bernisse and within an hour I had a quote ready l, she was able to get both mine and my wife's cars tinted and ready for the AZ summer within 2 days of me contacting her.  They did a perfect job with my wife's tint and an excellent job on detailing and tinting my truck.\n\nVery happy with the work they did, her son did a GREAT job detailing my truck which was plain filthy after driving it across country, the ceramic tint they installed keeps our cars much cooler.  I would recommend them to anyone and will certainly bring any future vehicles here.
1;Great place for mexican food if your white and never had homemade. Just like Seranos or any other chain, plus its more expensive.
4;Very good good day service very clean.   Good service.  Highly recommend.   Looks like it might be one of our new regular places.
3;"If there's something I developed a taste for over the last couple of years, it is definitely French cuisine. My girlfriend loves everything French, especially the food. I decided to take her here for our two year anniversary and I can't say that my expectations weren't met. The menu isn't a run-on book, it's a one page array of all things tasty. Les Poissons (hee hee hee, hah hah hah) looked and smelled fantastic. The wine was affordable per glass. We ordered the \""Frangria,\"" the French version of Sangria which was quite the punch.\n\nI have this weird sense of things where I judge a place I eat by what they give you for free, in this case the bread. Naturally, we sat down and were greeted with a French baguette accompanied by some delicious butter and an amuse bouche, which was some kind of pickled apple concoction. The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said \""I could just come here for the bread\"" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise. My beef wellington was.....nucking futs delicious. I've always wanted to try a wellington and oh my gosh was it delicious. The beef was tender and succulent, cooked just the way I like it. The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \n\nTo make matters \""worse,\"" we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert. Gluttony became our ruler at this point as we shoveled this behemoth of a dessert down our bellies completely satisfied with the meal as a whole. My only gripe was that our waitress was a little inattentive once we got our food. As we didn't see her from the moment we got our food till we were done, looking around for her to come by. Regardless, that would not be the deciding factor if I come back because I definitely will. \n\nGentleman, if you have a date and you want to impress her, go on and take her here. We sat inside but I hear the patio is just as nice. This is a great place for tourists and LOCALS alike."
4;Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\n\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)
0;I was really impressed when we contact First Option lending, they came to our house and walked through every piece of paperwork we signed for the loan application. I got a good vibe from the first line of communication. Soon after that no communication at all. This process began back in November and we are still chasing after them for status. On average , it takes a week to get a call back from our loan officer.  It's funny because, we are currently refinancing our rental home from a different company and the level of service has been exceptional, they send us updates to keep us in the loop constantly.  We are canceling our loan application with first option today and going with the other company.
1;"This would have been a 5 star review, but they charged me an extra $20 after check out for no reason! They asked for a credit card when I checked in, \""Just to have on file for incidentals...it won't be charged.\"" At least that's what I was told! There isn't any incidentals to be had at this hotel. No mini bar, no snacks in the room, and no drinks in the fridge. So what was the charge for? I used my own soap and lotion, and even paid double for some drinks and snacks at the snack bar downstairs...it just aggravates me. My friend stayed at the same time in a different room and was also charged the $20 after check out, so beware since it must be standard here!"
0;"Never again! I travel a lot. I eat out a lot. I don't Yelp as much as I should... but when I left my dinner here, I knew I had to Yelp this!\n\nWe were at BlogWord Expo and had dinner planned with friends and colleagues with a group of 15. We asked if seperate checks were doable (as anyone would with a large group) and she said yes. \n\nWe sat down at the table and within minutes the waitress dropped glasses (not one but a few) of water over a friend and the glass shattered all over the floor. My friend was wet. Accidents happen... we get that. But how this was handled was bad. A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. \n\nWe brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. \n\nThe food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...\n\nWe decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!\n\nThe bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each! She didn't tell us she would charge double and not double the size for these drinks!\n\nThe worst experience I have ever had! $150 for two people and this bad of service! We didn't even get a \""I am sorry for the wait and service.\""\n\nNot once. \n\nFor epic... I will Yelp. Epic being good and bad. In this case... epic fail."
0;I don't understand why this place is still around. Completely overpriced, not to mention AWFUL.\n\nMy age dashi tofu was swimming in the sauce, and literally turned to mush when I tried to eat it. The sushi was not fresh at all, and looked worse than the pre-packaged sushi you get at Ralph's. I mean, the fish looked like PLASTIC. Even my vegetable roll was awful, with strangely soggy vegetables and non-sticky rice. My buckwheat noodles were edible, but definitely nothing to write home about, and unfortunately the whole experience had already been ruined.\n\nThe edamame was decent. But really, how can you screw up edamame?
4;A few years ago, I tried scuba diving on vacation in a resort and it was a very stressful situation for me. I wasn't sure if I would ever try scuba again. \n\nA friend of mine told me about Destination Scuba and it changed my perspective on the world of scuba diving. Before I was afraid of scuba and felt rushed because I never had the chance to learn at my own pace. Destination Scuba was the complete opposite and has great instructors that know how to handle a scared little guppy like me! The ocean can be overwhelming, but also amazing and beautiful and given the chance to learn the basics of scuba with calm dive instructors who want me to enjoy it just as much as they do- it was just priceless! \n\nAnother cool aspect of Destination Scuba, they live up to their name! They plan many dive vacations throughout the year in tropical destinations. Sounds like the perfect excuse for a trip to the Bahamas- if you ask me!
0;if you're looking for customer service do not go to Bacchanal Buffet!  We hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 10:01 only to be turned away.  Absolutely no compassion!
0;Friendly service, had high expectations from the review on here. I ordered the carne asada nachos. The chips themselves were extremely greasy, which ruined my appetite. I was so looking forward to reading the pile high presentation of the nachos, what a let down.....one star because they have Cherry Pepsi.
2;This was an entertaining and enjoyable show. Definitely my mind was blown on more than one occasion.  But, maybe its because Penn and Teller have been on television so much, or maybe it is because I saw them perform 15 years ago, or maybe it is because the show was relatively short, or maybe it was because we had to make the hike out to the Rio to see the show -- whatever it was the show left me feeling a bit underwhelmed in the end.  For $100 a ticket it seems like a much better value to see a huge cast doing acrobatics over a custom stage than Penn and Teller like you have probably seen them before.
4;My husband and I attended Chef Alyssa's Dressed Up Game Day class in September. What a cool venue and a very fun date night! We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed meeting the other members of our kitchen team that night. We have already made the sweet potato wedges twice  since the class and are looking forward to making the baked wings (SO GOOD!) soon. We are looking forward to booking another class soon- maybe with some friends this time.
0;"If you stay here, be warned!  I just checked my AMEX statement and noticed that this placed charged me TWICE!  I purchased my stay through Travelocity (as I often do for my travels) and the front desk clerk even acknowledged that, but STILL... double the charge!  This has never happened to me with Travelocity so I can only believe the mistake was on the hotel end.  I called several times to try and resolve this with Susan in billing but she was not very responsive.  It was after several attempts and contacting the general manager Patty that I got a \""promise that a credit will be issued.\""  I keep calling AMEX to check and still NOTHING....... I stayed in March and it is June now... WTF?!  *****************DO NOT USE THIS PLACE**************** SHADY TO THE MAX!"
3;First they brought out bread.  The bread was good however it was cold and not warm which is a minus.  the second thing I ordered was the butternut squash soup which was incredible and I highly recommend. Next I had the mahi-mahi fish tacos the mango salsa on top made them very good.  The only disappointment was the side slaw salad which virtually has no taste I had to finally add salt to find if there was any flavor or not
4;Sushi Kame is placed in downtown Champaign surrounded by the more pricey restaurant such as Jim Gould, Escobar, and Kofusion. You would expect some overpriced meals at Sushi Kame but the items on the menu is reasonably priced. The food is simple and not gimmicky like the trendier places in town. Also the people are very polite. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!
2;I found this place after doing some Google searches for watch repair in Pittsburgh. I had a really nice watch gifted to me a few years back, but I didn't find myself wearing it very much, as it was a little too big. Since it's 2012 and we all need to step our game up, I decided to have some links taken out of the watchband and replace the battery in the watch.\n\nI choose this place because, it was the most convenient location for watch repair that I could find. I took my watch in about an hour before the end of the day on Friday. I thought that the job could have been accomplished easily and quickly, but the owner told me I would have to come back the next day...\n\nA word of caution, my watch was wound and working and several links had been removed as promised. However, as I tried the watch on I noticed that one of the pins was not in place properly. It just seemed a little off center. If an untrained eye could note this, a master watchmaker certainly should have been able to do the same. Had I not noticed this, my very expensive watch would have most probably met with a most untimely demise as it plummeted towards the nearest sidewalk. The owner was quick to fix this error, but did not seem very apologetic.\n\nThe price, $20, was fair and the work acceptable in the end.
2;Came here for a business dinner and sampled some delicious tapas. A little loud, service was pretty decent, enjoyable sangria. I was a little weirded out in the bathroom - instead of music there was a strange english/spanish lesson going on...translating what can only be described as bar language? 'yes, i would like another drink.' 'this wine is delicious.' 'where are the bathrooms?' Strange.\n\nSome dishes worth checking out:\nFried Calamari - the most tender pieces of calamari I've ever had. Not chewy at all. Magical.\n\nBlack Rice - not overwhelmingly squid-inky/briny.\n\nSauteed Padron Peppers - addictive. We were popping these like edamame.\n\nStuffed dates - yeah, these are your basic bacon wrapped stuffed dates taken one step further. Crisp and fried.\n\nI think we also got an oxtail dish? I have no idea what it was, but I've never had such tender meat before. Heavenly.
1;its a good place for  awesome fish fry all you can eay on friday nights.yummy, so if you are in the mood for fish drop by.
0;One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool
3;3.5 Stars\n\nFinally a pho place that I don't have to drive 15-20 min for. \n\nVerdict....it's definitely a keeper. \n\nOrdered my pho tai TO GO and egg rolls and the noodles were al dente exactly how I like them. The beef was definitely fresh and sliced by them or wherever they bought it because it was not your normal typical beef that you get at other places. My husband enjoyed the egg rolls more here but I didn't notice a huge difference except there was no lettuce to wrap the egg rolls with. Not sure if they forgot or if that's not their type but in any case it was decent. The broth wasn't bad either, not the best I've had but it works. There wasn't too much broth but it worked out since its so hot I didn't gulp down the broth anyways. There's only one size and I think its about 8 bucks a bowl give or take which is about the same as other places? Noodles are a lil less too but I was full regardless. \n\nNot sure how long they are giving away the 20% discount for but it's definitely a decent pho joint. The lady working there pointed out the 20% off that we received and service was pretty quick.
3;Excellent selection of pastries, including chocolate almond croissants.  \n\nBoth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio creme/paste (delicious!)\n\nThere is a Lafleur nearby, in case anyone wants poutine before or after...
2;I love the Westwood location in LA. It's fast, clean, and efficient. This location is none of the above. I went 2 times during my stay at the SLS and each time the food was decent but they never had enough workers. One worker kept putting on gloves to make the pizzas, when wearing the gloves while ringing orders into the computer system. She also used a dirty rag to wipe down the preparation area - all while wearing gloves. What's the point of the gloves?!?!
1;What a disappointment.  Everything was overly salted including the miso soup.  And it certainly was not worth the $50 per plate.  We won't be back,
3;I enjoy shopping for my groceries at this location. But I don't like the fact that the people who work here have no idea where anything is. Excuse me where would I find the Rotel? Rotel....whats Rotel? Wait do we sell Rotel? Hell, I don't work here I'm asking you. Really how can u work in a store and have no idea where anything is. So because I like the store and it's location I have just decided not to ask anyone where anything is. I just send the husband to look for items if I have no idea where things maybe. Other than that is a cool store.
4;I'm from Wisco.... glad to finally see a Culvers in Chandler.  Can't go wrong with a Burger and Cheese Curds.  Very clean and the service is excellent.
4;I love how there are a variety of menu options here (vs. Hot N Juicy), and their cajun sause is so unique...it's tasty and DELICIOUS!!  The service here is wonderful, as they are always upbeat, happy, polite, and care about your dining experience.
0;DON'T STAY HERE. As soon as you walk into this hotel it has an awful smell. I booked this hotel because it was close to training I was attending. I should of known something wasn't right with such low room rates. The hotel and rooms are very dirty and the carpets looked like they haven't been replaced in years. They should close down this hotel completely to do the renovation.
1;Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.
0;I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.
4;This place is breath taking you have to go here if you go to Vegas.\nThere is everything, shopping scenery, but don't forget your camera!!
3;Came here on a Sunday afternoon and was seated upon arrival (we were the only ones there for awhile, but it filled up eventually). There are 2 floors to Burger Bar, the first being the main reception area and the second I imagine opens up later on in the night as Crescent fills up with party-goers and clubbers.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, but none of the burgers scream excitement or exoticism. We ordered the wild mushroom burger and the super sonic burger, accompanied with onion rings and sweet potato fries. The burgers  themselves were pretty good. The buns however, made them. A woman actually came into the restaurant and asked the they sell the buns! The onion rings were cut thick, and wasn't all batter- a good thing! \n\nFor vegetarians, the option to swap out the meat burger for a black bean veggie patty is available, or there is a grilled veggie portabello sandwich available on the menu. \n\nThe docked star is for the staff. They were scantily clad (it's a Sunday afternoon, not a Friday night...please put some pants on, or shorts that actually fit you) and friendly, almost too friendly, it was overbearing. Our server explained it was his first day, so I guess he was trying to impress.
1;This place would be a lot more vibrant and useful if parking were free or somehow comped.  During its beginning a lot of the new store front attracted outsiders as we as local SS residents to walk the area, shop at the stores, and eat at the restaurants.\n\nNow ... it just doesn't seem to get over a rather nasty case of attrition.  There's chains, chains, and more chains.  I do highly recommend hitting places for happy hour specials, that's is something they do get right in the SSW.
3;You would think this place is actually in Mexico given how long I had been meaning to try it.  I can only say, I should have gone sooner.  Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.\n\nI actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing.
1;"Food can be iffy some times. \nI usually order piccatta, and the one and only time I had their veal, it was very tough. \n\nFood is over priced, the atmosphere is the only thing going for this place.\n\nStaff needs to be upgraded and trained all around.\nIn personality, service, and knowledge. \n\nWent to the bar and asked for a mojito. Bartender said she \""couldn't\"" make it. When the manager (I believe his name is Mike or something... blonde.... light complexion.) came around and asked how we were doing, I had brought up the bartender not having the supplies to make drinks... Like a full bar should. He challenged me, by letting me know that they have fresh mint and it is capable.\n\nWell, I got my 'mojito'. \nMakes me wonder if the bartender was telling me she couldn't make it because of the mint.... or that she COULDN'T make it...... because...... gag.\n\nLast June, I set up a birthday of about 16 for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation at least a week in advance. Waiter / busser would throw the bag of bread on the table, and then hide. They could barely be found. Had to beg for refills.\n\n\nWe have had one great waiter in the 3 years we have been eating there, and that is only because I took my pregnant self and spoke to the manager and complained hardcore. He told me to make a reservation with him, he comp'd our meal, and I'm sure that is why we were treated so nice."
1;"Disclaimer: I absolutely love One Nevada. My review for this location is solely based on this location and not the services of One Nevada overall.\n\nThere just must be something about when you put a teller behind a bullet proof glass case but attitudes here are no where near as friendly or personable at other branches that I am accustomed to visiting.\n\nI wouldn't even visit this location if I didn't have to but since this is the only location with a transaction center, I am forced to. The tellers do their job but basically that is it. Do not expect a \""thank you\"" or \""you're welcome\"". Definitely do not expect a \""have a nice day\"" or \""thank you for business\"". \n\nI hope One Nevada catches on and does some employee intervention with this branch. Coming is here is extremely unpleasant and every time I leave this branch, I always think I need to change banks."
3;Always a go to spot if I'm craving a hearty burrito! I recently got into the quesorito which is now hands down my top 5 burritos of all time. You have your regular chipotle burrito but instead of your average tortilla, the wonderful ingredients are wrapped around a quesadilla which just kicks your taste buds up a notch. It may be filling for everyone else but just right for me. I do also recommend the taco kit, which is pretty much two tortillas, rice beans and choice of meat with a side bag of chips and a drink! You cannot go wrong there! It is one of my girlfriends favorite things to get.
3;Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.
2;A-Ok in my book. Nike SB's are getting harder to find (at least in Nike Outlet stores) but this Factory Store had one so I just had to get it. My current SB is dilapidated so I needed a new one.
2;Went on a Friday night....waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Longer than average time to get our spinach and artichoke dip app ($7) The lower price meant smaller portion of dip.  Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich tossed in their buzzed wing type sauce. ($9.99)  Entrees came in a timely manner.  Fries are good steak fries with seasoned salt on the table and a number of dipping sauces available.  I got my fries with the mayo/mustard sauce called campfire.  I should say I ordered my fries with it because when the fries arrived the sauce did not come with it.  By the time the sauce arrived the fries and wich were long gone.  I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly.
3;"My husband and I have stayed at Harrahs a few times. This time we brought our kids and booked a \""classic\"" 2 queen bed room. This room is actually much quieter and bigger then their \""high roller\"" or \""premium\"" rooms, which is weird. There is no desk but there is a little table with 2 chairs. It's not fully updated but honestly it's not bad at all. I would book this room again if we had a choice of the other rooms. I didn't give 5 stars because the bathroom tub kept dripping water. It wasn't loud or anything but it was a minus."
2;I stayed here over the Labor Day Weekend...I upgraded to the newer room.  The room was small.  The two beds were not Queens. They were Full size.  Me and the family are not small people.  It was very uncomfortable.  I liked the price.  I love gambling here.  But I would not stayed with a lot of people.  They cater to an older crowd and families...
2;"I came here with a few friends for dinner, coming from a recommendation from Conde Nast Traveller.  It is easy to walk past 361 Saint Paul E., and it is not clearly marked!  Strangely, I'm a fan of that.  \n\nThe food was good and the waiter emphasized that everything was homemade.  Great!  Ate too many breadsticks, which for the longest time we thought they were table decorations.  \n\nOysters were fantastic - extremely fresh (one from PEI, one from NB), and the various sauces were fantastic.  \n\nThe clam chowder with various white fish was good, but overly salted.  Tuna was delicious.  Pancakes for dessert with Pimms butter were super amazing!  \n\nCocktails were good.  \n\nDecor: low key, homey, in the basement of a building.  It was a little bit drafty though and we found ourselves constantly adding on layers of clothing.  \n \nStaff: super charismatic and funny, with great recommendations on food and drink.  Not hard on the eyes either!\n\nOnly docking for the star would be that I was slightly disappointed on the \""homemade\"" aspect of things - when something is homemade, I would expect that the taste would be out of this world.  I did not find it so, particularly for the prices we were paying.  But, a cool place no less."
0;I dined at Strip House with a small group of friends on Saturday, December 18, 2010 hoping for a delicious steak dinner. No one in our group was impressed by our experience. I ordered the Porterhouse for two to share. It was cooked beautifully but lacked flavor and was therefore overpriced. My friend and I eat fine dining, particularly upscale steakhouses, quite often so we have some idea what steak should taste like. The lobster bisque was good but nothing to write home about. Our mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were unfairly small portions for our table and the mac n cheese was overwhelming with the truffle flavor. We were all disturbed by the harsh flavor. The mashed potatoes were bland. Sarah's salmon was cooked appropriately but the pesto fluff drowned out any real flavor. Even the bread was subpar. I would expect better from a restaurant in this price range. It was by far the most disappointed steakhouse experience the four of us had ever experience both individually and cumulatively and then to pay $400 was the ultimate slap in the face. I have no idea how this restaurant was rated so highly by other diners or culinary spectators because I think it was the biggest bogus culinery hipe of my life! Overpriced and not impressive! I would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! It actually put a damper on all of our moods the remainder of the night after having spent so much money and no dining satisfaction. The thought of that place now puts a bad taste in our mouths and turns our stomachs. And that is not even an exaggeration.
0;I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back.
2;Dropping some stars due to the Luminaria policy. Myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago. It rained today, so the luminarias were canceled, which I understand. However, as the event is sold out every other night, we were told we could not get tickets for another night and could get a refund or donate our ticket money. I do appreciate the refund, and I know they cannot control the weather, but I do think it stinks that we will miss the luminarias through no fault of our own.
4;Its 7:00am and I have to wait till 8:00 for a Doublecheese!!!! It used to be open 24hrs.  Not to long ago, we would drive to Barstow (2hrs) eat and drive back. Many times, I would go to the Barstow location, buy 20 doubles, they would wrap them for me and I would send them UPS Next day air to Boston to my friends. Been going to Tommys since a double burger, chili dog and a soda cost 90 cents.  Enough reminiscing..Its close to opening..
2;Came here one afternoon & finally decided to try out this place. I lived nearby & always loved the name idea. The employee was nice, but could have been helpful. My boyfriend & I ordered an iced blue velvet coffee, earl grey hot tea, cinnamon raisin bagel, & their broccoli & cheese soup. The blue velvet iced coffee was the best part, that was yummy. The soups texture & taste were good. Although I'm not sure if it was the oyster crackers, but it was a tad salty. The bagel was way over-toasted to where it was partially burnt. My hot tea wasn't bad at least. Earl grey can never disappoint. This little cafe is super quaint & peaceful. I would definitely come here to study or play scrabble over some coffee one day. Tipsy has a large selection of truffles, drinks, & snacks. It's like when you go to The Cheesecake Factory & just look through their large menu over & over (haha). It's worth a shot to see why they're running for Best of Las Vegas.
3;Good meal, good food.  Very good wait staff.  A wee bit expensive, but that was minor compared to the quality of the food and the apparent cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were amazed at the number of folks that kept streaming in for carryout.  Since we've never been to the restaurant, the locals must have already discovered this little gem.  I'd almost give it five stars, but would want to try other items on the menu first.
3;"For a long time, I avoided Qdoba. Really! I always had this idea that the food here was awful, greasy, and just all around bad for me. Well, I was mostly right, but it turns out that Qdoba is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! In fact, I could easily see it becoming a fantastic occasional treat in my life.\n\nI stopped in and ordered a quesadilla to go and couldn't have been happier. The pulled pork was delicious and I was able to get extra salsa, guacamole and sour cream in little cups on the side, meaning that my main entree wasn't completely slathered in distracting toppings. And I was SO impressed with the staff and assembly line they had going. Despite coming in to find a long dinner line, I was in and out within minutes. Very nice!\n\nI didn't stay to eat here because the layout in the dining area seemed pretty cramped, although I noticed as I was getting ready to leave that there was an upstairs. Any place in Oakland is bound to have space issues sometimes just because of the student lunch/dinner rush. But the layout here did nothing to help the matter; while the staff were able to keep the line moving, there was almost no room to actually accommodate the long line that began forming and snaking through the tiny building. \n\nStill, the food was pretty excellent, even if I had to go elsewhere to get some elbow room while I devoured it. For the record, comparing Qdoba and Chipotle seems pretty apples and oranges given that their menus are only a little similar. So sure, the food is better at Chipotle, but the options aren't NEARLY as diverse. Apples and oranges. A better comparison is Qdoba and Taco Bell, and in that sense Qdoba is truly superior. I mean really, who thinks it's even a contest?\n\nUnfortunately there were no reasonably healthy options here, so I doubt I'm going to be able to become a regular. Once I work off the quesadilla in about a month I'd love to eventually come back and see if the tacos compare - although I admit, when it comes to burritos I do think I'll forever be a Chipotle fan."
0;"I had the absolute worst experience here yesterday when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. The waitress could not have been any more rude. I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress. \n\nOne of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, \""How about I fix his fries first before they get cold?!\"" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, \""Next time you want cheese, tell me!\"" Our entire group was speechless.\n\nI have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place."
3;"I love this pretzel place!\n\nThe pretzels are big, sweet, and (usually) soft! I also love their lemonade. It is seriously delicious.\n\nThe service could use some work. I'm not a big fan of the \""fuchi face,\"" but other than that this place is great!"
0;I find it very hard to give anything more than one star if this business is in the business of turning away people before they can even become customers. I wanted to order a lunch combo and a drink. My total came out to about 12 bucks they said I needed a $15 minimum. I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place. I live less than 3 miles from this place you think they would make an exception for customers that are really close. The problem is that their delivery radius is too large .. They go from 40th av to 47th street and from baseline to northern. They are making their delivery money back on the customers that live closest to their restaurant. I'm sorry but I will never attempt to order from there again too bad I was excited to try a new Chinese place I don't sway from one to the next I mean c'mon Chinese food is chinese food when your talking about take out or delivery.  Ill just have to go somewhere ill be appreciated for trying a restaurant for a first time, I'm sure the next Chinese restaurant will want me to be a repeat customer. Siu Wok peace of advice here, don't ever turn away customers especially new customers its just not good business or profitable, tightn up your delivery radius and then you won't have to have a $15 minimum order set, $10 minimum would do just fine.
1;Went there after the club waiting to get my hands on some wings...after waiting for a table for 30 minutes, we sat down only to find out that they DISCONTINUED THE DAMN 25cent WINGS!!!!  It's $7.99 now for 10 wings and fries, BS.....anyways, it is cheap food price and quality wise.  You get what you pay for.  Waiter messed up the order, but whatever.\n\nAnd if you want wings tossed in butter, get mild...:/
2;Dollar Rent-A-Car requires you to fill up within 10 miles of the airport and show your receipt.  I used the GasBuddy app to find the cheapest gas in the area, and this Circle K fit the bill!
1;Couple days ago I visited a Streets of New York. My friend was driving and we were drinking so I may be confused, but I am pretty sure this is the one.  We had a tiny server named Carly?  Is this the right one?  Anyways, it was a big mistake.  My server looked like she may have been seventeen --while wearing makeup--and she acted even younger.  The personality that she wore at our table seemed to quickly dissolve when she exchanged words with members of the staff and I overheard countless inappropriate remarks made by her.  In addition to the unprofessional nature of our server, our food (which was mediocre) was apparently messed up by the kitchen (=server error), the tables were sticky and disgusting, and I walked out less satisfied than when I walked in.  \ntwo enthusiatic thumbs down
1;I can tell you they don't clean the equipment much at all, most of the staff is not helpful and bullshits too much, I have stood at the counter waiting while they talk, the tanning beds are down to one bed and is filthy, if they have time to BS they should clean the equipment, most of the equipment is older and not very well taken care of, the management should really do something, also busy and small, the golds I used to go to in a different state was excellent so not sure what the problem is here
2;The food here was pretty good. But the service was very slow. And we had a cranky kid with us which you would think would speed them up a little bit. But that didn't help. They don't have high chairs or boasters so I would say this place is NOT kid friendly. If you want to try it leave the little ones at home for this one.
1;The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.
2;"Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \""to go\"" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \""this place is filthy\"". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."
2;This is a great bar for a Tuesday night and highly recommend going after 9pm to get the $3 burger special.  Go early to get a seat because this place fills up slightly after 9. I sat all the way upstairs and the bar was quiet but it was a Tuesday night after all.  They had a great list of draft beers including Pumking which I would have normally gotten but at $10 for a small glass that was a little much for me. I ended up with a bottle of Purple Haze another favorite of mine. The bartender told me there was a glitch in the computer system and it only rang up for $3-nice surprise.  Unfortunately this didn't happen for the second round but the bartender made sure to tell me in advance which was perfectly fine.  I stayed for the 9 o'clock burger special and it was declivous. Pleasantly surprised by the double burger and highly recommend the Stack'd special sauce!
3;I never knew Pittsburgh provided such a wealth of coffee shops! Since I work in the Lawrenceville area, it's the perfect place to pick up a cup of joe. The shop has a cozy feeling with tables that allow their patrons to socialize or work. Their skillful baristas produce smooth espresso drinks with the milk at the right temperature. I shall be swinging by often before work to get my daily dose of caffeine!
0;I was charged $65 to remove and reinstall a tonneau cover while having the bed sprayed. Manufacturer quotes less than 30 minutes, but it is closer to 10-15 to install. The cover was reinstalled incorrectly by the LineX tech. I would expect the technician to know what he is doing if they are charging that much.
4;"This place is my \""old stand by,\"" and somehow I end up here 1-2 times a week. I have tried maybe half of the menu by now, and I always gravitate to the Hummus Plate Salad.  It is so delicious. Vegetarian friendly, though I am a meat lover, and full of roasted veggies, hummus, perfect balsamic vinagrette and nine grain bread. Heaven on a plate :) And for under $10!!"
3;I give the Buffet 4 stars.  They were very accommodating to my family of 12.  Just coming from a funeral it was pretty draining for me and wasn't feeling all to well.  \nMy 1st trip was to the salad bar very small limited choices but I got in my greens.  The southwestern black bean salad was the highlight.  Then I went down the food line from Asian, Chinese, skipped over the build your own pasta station, a highlight of the place by the people waiting in line.  Then there was Italian, American, southern and of course Mexican, lots to choose from so variety was good on this day.  \n\nI'm not that big of a fan of buffets anymore since 90% I'm eating healthier meals.  The healthier I eat the mire salt and sugar I notice, this place is high in salting there foods and more variety in fats.  I guess it's was tourist and Vegas people want.  $9.99 is not a bad price but you got to eat at least $9.99 or more to get you value so make sure you have an appetite
0;Ok so I decided that I should just contact cooperate concerning how I was treated and how the other customers were being ignored as well.  They took my complaint and informed me that the store manager would contact me back.  She did, and I found out her father was from my city back in Michigan. \n\nShe was mortified to hear how I was treated and informed me that is why she was transfered from California, to change the way the staff interacted with their customers. \n\nBecause of my hassle she told me she would send over some in home specialist to help me with my bedroom and give me ideas and have a lot of stuff to show me.  When they arrived, they arrived later than the appointment I set up, by like 3 hours.  They also did not have anything prepared and came equipped with an out dated catalogue and a tote bag full of wood chips to show colors.  \n\nThey noticed that I had the current catalogue which they did not even have in the store yet and basically let me do all of the talking, when they left, I still did not know what to do with my room and to top it all off they STOLE my new catalogue! \n\nWTF?!  SERIOUSLY?!!  LOL how pathetic!  Screw you West Elm!!
1;"After a week of attending this yoga studio, I was no longer able to ignore my loudly-clanging bullshit detector, and had to quit. Nothing personal against this particular franchise...my beef is with Bikram yoga in general. Doing a Bikram class feels like working out at the Jonestown Athletic Club!\n\nBikram devotees strike me as slightly brainwashed in their adherence to the cult of Bikram. This is reinforced at the end of every class, when everyone utters a monotone \""Namaste\"" in unison, while laying flat on the floor with heels touching and palms out. Heaven's Gate, anyone? \n \nAnother thing I found creepy is that the instructors are required to recite pretty much word-for-word from a script. Funny quips and jokes are more robotic, less funny when you've heard them over and over (\""Japanese ham sandwich\""). They also have to repeat Bikram's mangled English (\""Put your exactly forehead to your knee\""). Exactly forehead? WTF is that?\n \nI'm not blaming the instructors -- it's Bikram himself (Bikram Choudhury, who devised this regimen in the early '70s) who insists that all his franchisees follow his shtick TO THE LETTER if they want to keep teaching. Yes that's right -- FRANCHISEES; it's a freakin' FRANCHISE that will set you back $10,000 and then $1,000 a month. That's in addition to the $10,500 fee for taking the required instructors' course. Think of all the Bikram studios across the U.S. The humble yogi is raking it in!\n \nWell, at least he's honest about it. Direct quote from Bikram: \""Bikram yoga is so big. This is a bathroom slipper you buy (for) $2 in Kmart. But you put Bikram on it, it'll sell for $35 in a second.\"" I'll give him props for his balls. Oh, speaking of his balls, here's another direct quote: \""I'm beyond Superman. I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me.\""\n \nIndeed, back in 2000 he sued a couple of yoga techers in CA for teaching a modified version of Bikram (they had the audacity to add music and lower the thermostat in the room from the sacrosanct 105 degrees, 40% humidity). The case was settled out of court.\n \nIn addition to these ethical quibbles, I'm not so sure about the health benefits of doing a strenuous workout in a 105-degree room. They say I will sweat out all the \""toxins\"" in my system. As far as I know, sweat is just salt and water. I didn't see any booze, shrooms or trans fats rolling down my face.\n \nI was going to finish my 30-day trial membership at Bikram Yoga Summerlin, just to give it a fair shake. Maybe I'd end up getting over my reservations, lose 10 pounds, become more grounded, and be able to sleep well again....??? \n \nThen I came to my senses and went back to Las Vegas Athletic Club... which costs me $9/month and offers a variety of un-copyrighted, unpretentious yoga classes. Holla!"
3;Siam Terrace is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Urbana. It's also memorably one of the few restaurants I have a favorite dish at just because they make a red curry so well. Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.\n\nIt's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.\n\nWhile I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood).
0;Out of Business. Building has been vacant for a couple years. Will be torn down as part of the freeway expansion.
4;Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.
2;I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha
4;"Nice modern hotel.  The rooms are affordable, and trendy.  Just beware it is no where near the strip.  I have stayed here several times and have always been more than happy with my stay. The rooms are clean and the bed and linens are nice and comfortable.  It's a great place to stay for a \""stay cation\"" or if you want to stay somewhere quieter than the strip.  It's convenient to Nellis Air Force base so if you are TDY I suggest staying here.  The rooms are 150 times better than on base plus there's excellent food choices just steps away in the casino. It's also convenient to the 215 so it's easy to get around the city.  It has a great pool, free wi-fi and free valet parking.  Great prices and great rooms! I highly recommend it!"
0;One star is being considerate....... \nWent @ 5pm on a Saturday & sat @ the bar. Bartender was restocking the bar @ the other end & never greeted us. While we waited patiently for her to come over, 4 people walked in wanting drinks to-go & she served them before even greeting us. I had to stop the Manager to take our drink order & food order after waiting about 10 minutes. \nOnly about 4 tables were occupied in the restaurant, yet it took about 40 minutes to get burgers for the 3 of us. The food was decent but customer service was horrible.
1;We came here as an alternative to Pho Kim Long, which is always frequented when in Vegas.  The only things better about this place than PKL are that it's cheaper and they have really generous portions.  \n\nThe food was meh.  Their nem nuong rolls are huge, but that's cause they stuff it with lots of vermicelli noodle.  The nem nuong itself resembles and taste like sausage.... no pun intended. And theres like 2 pieces of it..  It wasn't terrible - just not very nem nuongish..\n\nThe rice plate that I had (bbq pork chop) was alright.  I thought it was a bit too salty.  And i asked for an egg over easy, but they fried the hell out of it.\n\nI didn't expect awesome service  - I never do when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. But on top of mediocre food, they have terrible service.  Therefore, the verdict of this review is 2 stars.
3;Keller and French cooking.  That about sums it up.\n\nFor brunch, the chicken and waffles is a winner. Not to mention the fresh made profiteroles are fantastic, order before they sell out.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu really as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThis place is located on an upper level at Venetian, you take the guest room elevators up and then cross the sky bridge and you arrive at the entrance. By no means cheap, but also not as expensive as many places in Las Vegas.  If you self park, there is a special Bouchon elevator at the ground leve of the parking structure.
3;My go to place for Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice!\nAdd in a side order of their crunchy good spring rolls and I'm set. Fast, almost always friendly service, and I've always wondered how that night manager, at least he looks like the manager, is able to stay that skinny when he is surrounded by all this food...
4;This place was amazing. Great service, perfect timing of all courses, the 12 ounce filet was easily some of the highest quality meat I've ever come across while being perfectly cooked and the lemon cake (made fresh in house everyday) was the perfect end. Will return soon with a smile on my face.
3;Great food, great service, solid ambiance. We ordered the Valentines Day's wine menu special and it was just an overall fantastic experience. The attention from the wait staff was amazing for as busy as they were and for $125 per person including wine - 6 wines/6 mini-courses - what a great value! They even threw in a round of cocktails while we waited for our table.
0;One of the worst bars with horrible bartenders. Do not go if it is your birthday. There are many other great places Dow town than this place.
4;Yuzu just got their liquor license today, which is great because I plan on going there again very soon. It'll be great to have some warm sake with my meal!\n\nI follow these guys on Facebook, where they often list the specials they have. It's great because I'm not in Vegas as much these days, and like to have reliable places to eat. Since Hougans closed, I was hoping to find a place to full the void that isn't AYCE or buffets, and Yuzu really fills that need well.\n\nKeep up the great work!
1;I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. \n\nAlthough the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. \n\nWhatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate! What a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices!
1;After a friend raving about this place for 6 months I had to go.  I'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average.\nI'd never go again simply for the fact they don't have Sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea.  Boo.
4;Just as good as Rainbow Donuts and it is in Goodyear
2;I have ordered from here a lot. Their imperial pasta used to be a lot better and they have started skimping on the seafood which at a pricy dish, should be more. The garlic bread isn't made with much care. The carrot cake comes to you frozen and their delivery driver is reasonably nice. I got the calamari once and it was very salty. When I called the restaurant back (which I never do) and alerted them to it, the lady was very rude and said there was nothing she could do about it. For an ok overpriced place I'd say order from here. Have never tried their pizza though.
4;Traveling with a coworker who lives more locally, I am super glad I fessed up to being a snob about eating at chain restaurants.  I turned down Subway and broke out my Yelp app!  Zookz was nearby and had good ratings so we checked it out.\n\nWhat a different idea.  It reminds me of Uncrustables in the freezer section of the grocery store but with much more adult and better fillings.  \n\nI walked in and saw a picture of the #13 which is poached egg, feta, spinach, tomato.  I didn't even look any further..this looked amazing.  And it was!  I wish I could have tried more!  I do think my coworker could have eaten more but they did have some side options available.  The sandwich was less than $5, I believe.  All options appeared $7 and less.  They also have Coke products...I'm a sucker for a fountain diet Coke.\n\nThe service was really friendly with someone greeting us immediately, taking our order promptly, and even asking how our meal was and how we heard of Zookz!\n\nMy only desire is that they open one in Dallas or Plano, Texas!  (:
2;I found Moe's to be average. I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and it was pretty bland.. nothing too special. \n\nThe free chips and salsa bar are a plus as well as the outdoor seating. They also are very efficient, especially with a crazy lunch rush.\n\nThe main reason for my average review is because of the queso. It basically had no vegetable in it.. it was just white. I'm used to (& addicted) to Q'doba's. They are not even similar. \n\nI may head back to try a regular burrito or something different.
1;We hadn't been to a Feast buffet in a while, so my husband surprised me when he said he wanted to try it.  Little did we know it would be an 1hr in line and the food was old.  It turns out that Wednesdays are senior days at all Stations casino's, so be weary if you are gonna go be sure it's worth your wait and then when you're done, expect to still be hungry!
0;"The name says it all.  Terrible.\nI guess you pay the consequences for being cheap and stopping at the first place we drove past.  $10 for a tiny buffet with the normal free hotel food:  wet eggs, funky already made omelets, oval hashbrowns, thin bacon, and funky fruit salad.  They had a carving station with dry meat that was recommended I \""put a lot of barbecue sauce on it because it helps make it better\"" by an employee.  \nWe did get a lot of champagne.  The only good thing.  \nMy stomach was very angry at me for filling it with what this place tried to convince us was food."
3;The Wild Thaiger is one of my new favorite places.  Every dish I've tried as been excellent.  They accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as I (unknowingly) arrived just at closing.  The peanut sauce on the satay is amazing.  Pad Thai is a standby at a Thai place, but it definitely does not disappoint here.  The beef curry was excellent.  The ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good.  Coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire.  Good place to go after an Art or Heard museum visit.
2;Remember  the days when you could watch a movie for $1?  I don't, but I hear folks reminiscing about them.  Old timer or not, Cinemark is the pretty decent place if you want to watch movies just out of rotation at the major theaters.Admission on the weekends is $2.25!  During the week its only $2 and $1 on Tuesdays.  Located behind the Krispy Kreme in Matthews (just look for the 'Hot' sign), the place looks like Pee Wee Herman's playhouse on the inside.  But I can forgive that.  \n\nThey show movies generally two months after their original release date.  Its your typical movie-fare, but   occasionally they throw in an indie or foreign film.  Look for the CineArts logo on the Showtimes page of the website. \n\nPlease be forewarned however: the concession stand is NOT discount price.  A large popcorn and drink runs $9.  Also, if you're going on a Fri or Sat., there will be a lot of teens.  They have cracked down on teen loitering in recent years, but certain teen-friendly movies might not be fun to watch on the weekend.  However, Cinemark Matthews Movies makes a good cheap date or fills a boring weeknight.  Netflix and Redbox watch out!
2;"They used to be better here but all the good employees seem to never stay somewhere too long these days! now days, the staff is ok, not great and they have all kinds of signs in their drive thru that are written by an angry child. \""please keep transactions less than 5 and make sure your transaction is ready!!!\"" or something like that!\n\nIt's annoying when you go inside and need a notary or something and they try to sell you an auto loan or ask to refi your house."
4;I fell in LOVE with this place so much that I went back the next day to try more food and cocktails!\nI LOVE the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing!
0;I came here once and won't be back. The drinks were low on alcohol and they messed up my tab.
0;The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable.
4;"With all the hype and great things said about this place, why wouldn't I try a little Good Fellas Grill.  In addition, I was looking for something a little on the healthy side, and this somewhat meets that criteria.\n\nOH MY GOSH!  Isn't that hummus and baba ganoush amazing?  The owner split our plate in half so we could enjoy this excellent dip.  It packed flavor, freshness, and a delicious spread on top of my pita.  The wifey and I were not able to finish it, and I would have to be so bold to say that it even tasted better the following day.  No way?  Oh yes way, my friend!\n\nThere is a ton of hype on the lentil soup, but I would have to say the potato soup had more flavor and was definitely more hearty than the lentil.  Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.\n\nThe wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \""bam, pow, or crunch!\""  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.\n\nIt definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!  We will see you again!"
2;I am a Mediterranean food junkie!! Khoury's is really authentic Lebanese food which always satisfies my cravings. It is extremely delicious and addicting! I recommend the chicken kabob plate with hummus. The fatosh salad is amazing too! I've had problems in the past with slow service but they are very friendly which, for me, makes up for it. :)
0;"I ate at Olive's in NYC and gave it 2 stars but the LV-Olives is even worse! Our waiter was retarded: he messedup the order at least 3 times. He was so confused. We ordered the flat bread and it came with no cheese and it wasnt cooked. WTF? What a big disappointment. Once again, nice decor, okay service and good drinks = big bill. im dont like these \""new-American\"" eateries. The food is so dull every time."
0;"I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons....\n\n 1. it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage (beer) and about as long for glasses of water. (the restaurant was NOT even 25% full!)\n2. the waiter \""strolled\"" by with his Faux Hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later.\n3. when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger.\n4. we displayed mysterious item mentioned in #3 to said Faux Hawk and he appropriately took the plate away. however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked.\nbottom line, the grilled salad i had was good, but not good enough to warrant a second trip to Cook N Jacks or a recommendation to anyone."
2;A farewell lunch for a coworker landed me here.  I wasn't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal, it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do.  Thankfully, my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than I expected, with lots of fries on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus.
4;Awesome AYCE sushi. They have egg custard which is my favorite. The only down side is its a little brown. But, still delicious. The sushi offered includes nigari and combo rolls. The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.
1;Grease Paradise. You can smell the grease from two blocks away...
0;"The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \""no chocolate shake.\"" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!"
3;The food was very good and different.  We started with the guacamole which was very good and tasted fresh.  For dinner, I ordered the Pollo Relleno which was absolutely delightful. A chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, corn and goat cheese, surrounded by a poblano cream sauce. The mashed potatoes were unique and had a bit of a kick (in a good way) they were guajilo mashed potatoes and the accompanying vegetables were delicious.\n\nFor dessert we had the flan which was a bit rich, but still very good. \n\nWe went on a Saturday evening around 7:30p, the place had a couple private parties going on but we opted to sit in the bar area, as it had quite a bit more atmosphere than the dining areas.  Parking was tight, but it looks like they are now using the available lot in the back which provided a ton more additional parking.
2;I went for an early afternoon trip to the driving range. This is the closest one from my hotel. I decided to play after a bucket. The course was in good condition. Forgiving and flat. Not a lot of challenge except for the greens. They are so sloooow.  $ typical city course.  Lots of public walkers in the course so watch out for errant shots. \nNot bad for a quickie round before sundown!
0;Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part
4;Saturdays and Tuesdays are $1 Margarita days.\n(Oh and the food is really good too.)
0;"Update: DON'T TAKE YOUR DOG HERE!!! \nSo livid that I will detail why in a few hours. \nI haven't had a drink in 9 mos, just bc I never really drink, but I just poured one today! (It's 3:30pm, too) HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! \n\nI haven't been here yet, but scheduling my first appointment (spoke w Melissa) was such a complete nightmare that I'm seriously worried about taking my dog here. I'm hoping the reviews are trustworthy and the grooming isn't reflected by the complete idiot I just spoke with on the phone. A neighbor recommended the place, and I don't like Petsmart's filthy grooming salon. \n\nI tried to get information about what was included in the haircut and it was like I asked the 4 yr old down the street; there were also dogs barking so loudly in the background that both of us had to repeat everything 3x. Seriously worried! \n\nWill update this rvw after appointment"
0;Disappointing! As a vegetarian, I had high hopes for Fern, but the food was flavorless and executed poorly. The atmosphere is cozy, small and quaint with soft, mason jar chandelier lighting. The service was good. But I can't get over how bad the food was. \n\nThe CAULIFLOWER POUTINE was a good idea, but the potato mixed with the cauliflower had been whipped to the point of having a glue-y texture. The kind of texture that makes your tongue stick to the top of your mouth while you're trying to chew. The cheese curd tasted like mozzarella, which was fine, but nothing special. The tomato gravy was fine, and the little pile of greens on top were the only interesting flavor in the dish (very strong and herb-y). We were planning to order a few more appetizers, but after the Poutine showing, we ditched that idea. \n\nThe OM BURGER was inedible. The bun was dry and hard, and the burger patty was dense and hard and flavorless. The condiments couldn't save this burger. \n\nThe 200 YEAR OLD SOURDOUGH FLATBREAD title created a hype that the thick, hard, stale, non-sour flatbread did not live up to. I took 3 bites, which was 2 too many. On the plus side, the topping - chorizo, verde sauce, red onions and cotija cheese - was flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in scraping and only eating the top of my pizza. \n\nThe sides were also a disappointment. The QUINOA of the day was described as red quinoa, mango, mint, red onion, and some other delicious sounding ingredients. It was fresh and cold, but not at all delicious. After coating with salt, a few bites were edible, but really still no flavor at all. \n\nThe SMASHED CRISPY FINGERLING POTATOES had potential, but only 3 of 12 potatoes were actually smashed and crispy. The other 9 were whole boring fingerling potatoes with no flavor or crunch. After mixing the flatbread topping with some of the potatoes, I was able to eat a few bites. \n\nThe waitress seemed surprised that we didn't want to take to-go the 75% of our dishes that we didn't eat. No, thanks. We're heading to Taco Bell for a little flavor.
1;I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie. \nI ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.\n\n Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop. \n\nMy second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return. \n\nI think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00. \n\nI'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg.
1;"Firefly is a cool place, but much more for the trendy crowd than for the foodies, like me. It was really loud and crowded. The menu did not have anything very adventurous, in fact quite the opposite. The \""french fries\"" tapas were ok. So was the manchego mac and cheese. The grouper was very dry and plain. The salad was acceptable, but the empanadas seemed small for tapas. The albondigas were boring meatballs with no real flavor. The best thing was the paella, and I've had much better.\n\nIf you are looking for great tapas, this just isn't the place."
4;This particular Domino's Pizza is the location I use for delivery when I would like a pizza at home.  They are always prompt and very polite when they deliver, and the pizza is hot fresh and baked perfectly.
1;I'll put it this way -- this place is not worth $55 for lunch for two.\n\nTwo burgers, an order of fries, a Manhattan ($10), a beer = $55 with tip. Nice little spot, but hard to justify the cost.\n\nThe burgers were decent but not rave-worthy, the glass seemed underfilled with the Manhattan - though what was there was tasty.\n\nIf you like over-spending, this place is good. If you're more value oriented, skip it.
2;Los 7 Compadres has a variety (20) of combination platters for about 7 bucks.  Between my wife and I we had 7 items on our combination platters, which we shared.  7 has been a recurring number for us starting with the OYE at Malee's.  Including the rice and beans, the sour cream and the guacamole this gave us an astounding number of possible combinations for each bite.  \n\nA bite of chicken enchilada.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with rice.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with guacamole.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with guacamole, rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream, rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream, rice, beans and guacamole.\n\nPlay this out again with the burrito, cheese enchilada, tamale, beef enchilada, bean enchilada, etcetera.  All of the food was good.  Portions were generally large.  I found the tamales to be the least satisfying item.  They were a bit dry and the dominant flavor was just the spice of jalapeno.\n\nNote-even the mild here has a real bite.  Overall I'd give them 3.5 stars.  Good enough for a return trip.
3;You can't really have too many complaints about Target. It is usually clean, the employees are friendly, and they have pretty much everything you want (albeit, they are more expensive than Wal-Mart and have a smaller selection of certain items). This Target is no exception. The quality of items, especially clothing, accessories, and shoes, tends to be higher than that of Wal-Mart as well.   Additionally, they have a grocery section in case you need to purchase food items. Because this Target is located in a large shopping center with a lot of other stores, sometimes parking is a bit difficult, but that is a small concern in the grand scheme of things.
3;Not bad, not bad, check it out.\n\nOK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.\n\n1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.\n\n2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.\n\n3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.\n\n3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.\n\n4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!\n\n5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!\n\nSide note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!\n\nCheck it out.
3;"So, I always have mixed emotions with this place but the moment I eat the Al Pastor Tacos, I end up LOVING this place again. The only down fall is that occasionally, our order is incorrect, whether it means they added guacamole or they didn't give us 10 tacos. For example,  We had ordered 10 tacos the last time and the order came out to be $30!!! Without questioning, we paid, left, and felt ripped off. Come to find out, they had charged us for the \""bigger\"" tacos that we never ordered versus our usual order of the 10 \""small\"" tacos. The only harm done was in our pockets. Our stomachs and taste buds, however, were quite satisfied.\n\nAs far as Carne Asada Tacos, they are fairy good. The only reason I go here is for their Al Pastor Tacos... although, they always right down Adobada Tacos, so I am unable to confirm what it is I'm eating, because the menu says they have Al Pastor tacos. Nonetheless, these tacos are amazing. \n\nThe place is like the usual little Mexican Restaurant but the food is definitely a bit superior on the food chain."
3;Their pizza rolls are to die for! We get delivery from here once a week. The only downside is delivery usually takes 45mins at least..... I suppose it's worth the wait
4;"This is my favorite sushi joint!  The atmosphere is relaxed and fun.  Sitting at the sushi bar, there is always something new.  You might even get a free surprise from one of the chefs.  Yum!  They have a \""frequent buyer\"" program, and when you turn in your little Sumo card after you eat they will give you a credit on it.  When my credit gets high enough I turn it in for a meal on the house!  Free food-what could be better? The plum wine is sweet and the fish is fresh.  Even green tea mochi to finish the meal.  This is top-notch stuff!"
0;Food was bad, service was non existent (we had to go find our server to ask for our check), restaurant was ambienceless. No wonder it was 90% empty when we walked in.
2;Nothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona.
3;Just finished my drink! This place is in a convenient location and the drive thru was super quick! When we drove up, some one took our order by coming to our window. The drinks were ready by the time we got to their window! Everyone seemed super enthusiastic and nice.\n\nI got a medium non fat blended chai latte. It was good! I liked the topping they put on the whipped cream. It was a mix of brown sugary nut meg goodness! I also tried the kicker which was good too. Neither of the drinks were too sweet. \n\nThe only thing is that I wish the chai had a bit more chai flavor. It was a little bland, but still refreshing. The drink quickly became just ice after a several sips. \n\nI would come again, maybe to try it iced instead of blended! I also want to try the Coconut drink.
0;"Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.\n\nVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.\n\nVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.\n\nVisit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?\n\nVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \""I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\"" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \""There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\"" \""We don't.\"" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \""No, I told you we don't.\"" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.\n\nI mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way."
4;I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!
1;Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \n\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \n\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \n\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.
0;I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place
1;Man I was super excited to get some Raising Cane's chicken fingers since I've only ever had them in Vegas before.  Saw some lower ratings for this one, but I've been to like six different ones and they've all been good.\n\nHowever, this one was not up to par.  Staff was fine, but the fingers were not juicy and crisp but felt like they were over cooked and dry (maybe the fryer temp is too high?).  Same for the fries which were too well done (and typically I would rather have slightly overcooked than undercooked fries).  Then the toast was a bit too mushy and didn't have that crispy buttered side while staying firm but spongy on the non-toasted side.  At least the sauce was still the same :) \n\nSince I'm not in this part of PHX often, I'll hope the one I hit up tomorrow is better or just go to Raising Cane's in Vegas...
4;This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.
1;The worst Korean BBQ I have ever been, not too much choice u can really eat, also they serve some Chinese& Japanese food, wt the hell!!!!!! It's not a real Korean BBQ. Also let's talk abt the price I walked in by myself, order a ice tea to drink, total for me is $28!!!!
4;I am really enjoying the Hot Pilates, Zumba and now TRX, great workouts,  I LOVE Gabbi and her energy and caring about each and every client that comes in.  She make everyone feel welcome.  Gabbi pushes you to get the body and results that you want.  I don't like to exersice, Gabbi makes all her classes fun, so I really like going to her studio.\nInferno Pilates offers so much more that workouts.  Give it and try and you will see what I mean.
1;Not really that impressed.  It looked like it could have been a really cool place to eat, so I'm a little disappointed.\n\nWe got our food to go and ordered it from the bar.  The bartender wasn't the least bit friendly.  He seemed irritated that we were there at all.  He was however, very nice when he told us we needed to move.  \n\nThe burger that I ordered was alright, I kind of gave up on eating it...it was one that you put together yourself and the ingredients that they gave me to do so weren't cooperating with each other.  I ended up covered in ketchup and at least half my burger uneaten.  The fries were soggy too, like maybe they had a light rinse before they were thrown in the box.\n\nThe clam chowder was really good though.  But I don't know if that's even saying much, I'm pretty sure nobody makes their soup from scratch these days.\n\nI may venture back for the $1 oysters though.  Maybe.
0;The first time I drove by Ruby Jane's I thought it was closed because of the decals completely covering the doors. \n\nToday, I saw from their hours posted that they were open. I was barely greeted by a young timid girl who seemed uncomfortable being at the front of the shop. \n\nI asked her if she had samples of the caramel popcorn and the honeycomb chocolate, she had neither. Then I asked her if she had anything I could sample and she grabbed a tray of unimpressive looking chocolates. \n\nAt this point, I asked to speak with the owner to see if she could offer me a sample of the confections I wanted to try. Immediately she has a what do you want type of attitude. She tells me this isn't See's Candy, we are a small shop that can't afford to give out samples and we do very well without giving out samples. She acted as though she didn't need me to purchase anything from her nor did she care about my first experience. \n\nAs a business owner you cannot have this attitude towards your customers especially because bad customer service travels fast through social media outlets like Yelp. \n\nI didn't purchase anything because a business owner with this type of mind set does not deserve my money.
4;We discovered this place by accident and have used it for the last 2 years.  Feri is the new owner having bought it from Nati.  Feri is a very quiet soft spoken lady,  great seamstress, not very entrepeneurial (good for clients) and a push over if you are going to haggle (please don't) we also want her to stay in business and keep her kind demeanor.  Over the last two years, we have had her hem countless pairs of slacks and for $10-12 ea, had her sew custom furniture covers  and shade cloth for outdoor area.   For any sort of custom work,  we think the pricing is very fair. The regular work like hemming is a low as it should go.  For the customer who was complaining about the price alteration on their $50 pair of pants for semi custom work, what are you expecting?  You do semi custom work on designer clothes/suits or gowns or you have a sentimental attachment to a piece of clothing else its not worth it.
3;We got a 10 percent discount from the hotel we were staying so well worth the price.  The 3-D movie was only about 15 minutes, but it was cool.  And the butterflies were gorgeous.\n\nNext you go into a room where you can see butterfly chrysallis and they're actually hatching out of them right then and there.  If you have the patience, you can see several different types of butterfly emerging.\n\nNext area is where all the butterfly are.  There are a ton.  Way more than you'd see at the butterfly attraction in San Diego.  The minute you walk in, there are a swarm of butterflies.  You have to watch where you place your feet as well, as there are butterflies on the ground as well.  \n\nSeveral butterflies landed on my daughter.  She was both thrilled and nervous.  She wanted them to land on her, but it scared her a little.  At one point, I had three butterflies landing on my shirt.  \n\nThis is a great place for photographers.  You'll get a ton of butterfly photographs and there's so many different varieties.\n\nThe only drawback is that it is quite humid and hot.  My husband turned bright red, so we had to take a break in their snack room.   There's plenty of parking.  It's going to be part of the Odyssea complex some day.  It looks awesome.  I can't wait to go back when everything is in place.
0;The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)
1;I hate to say this, but out of all of the cupcakeries I've tried, Cream & Flutter is my least favorite.  From frosting to cake...very disappointing.  Maybe I should go for a cookie next time?
0;I will not be back to this restaurant. I placed an order for pickup last Thursday for myself and a co-worker. I had the small jerk meal and my co-worker had a side of collard greens. The chicken was hard, dry and cold. It wasn't fresh.  It was pulled from the fridge and put in the microwave. The beans were hard and rice chewy. The collard greens were bland. Very disappointing. I will not be back.
0;What a joke. Guy shows up an hour late, then has no idea what he is suppose to do. What I scheduled on the phone was completely different than what he showed up to do, and the price was different. He had no idea what I was talking about. I don't know if it was the technicians fault or the offices fault for giving him bad info. I asked him to do what was discussed on the phone and all I got was a blank stare. If a company can't show up on time and doesn't even know what they are there to do, then they don't need my money. There are plenty of other pest control services, so I suggest using a different one.
2;"Visited Sticki Rice while in Dilworth the other day. If the name hasn't given it away already, it has lots of asian looking home decor and furniture items in it. Although their slogan is \""Bring the World Home\"", it should really say \""Bring Asia Home\"". It was a pretty cool place, and among all of the large and small furniture pieces you will find other home accents, purses, candles and the like. The furniture prices varied, from very expensive to reasonable. Being that these are true antiques, all of the pricing seemed about right. I really liked the set up of it as well; it is like a house and you can bounce from room to room checking out items. Be sure to watch out for the brass hand sticking out the inside of the door when you come in, it freaked me out!!"
0;"Don't waste your time here. We waked out after the aggressive \""jerk\"" sales guy refused to offer us more info on the bed we were interested in. Hungry commission driven focused on the sale not the customer. He even shouted out 1/2 off was my wife and I walked out the door. HORRID Experience."
1;Our first mistake was deciding on where to go for dinner a little late in the evening. When we arrived I was super hungry. We had two servers, neither of which could seem to serve us with any decency in speed or clarity. By the time our food arrived, I felt like I had already been in the restaurant way too long. There were quite a few other patrons in the place, but it wasn't packed with a wait to be seated. \n\nMy second mistake was assuming that Tea is unflavored. No, it's Passion Fruit Tea. Adam Carolla has a rant about Passion Fruit Tea, and I am thinking of joining his Army after my experience at Mezzo. All she had to do was to give me a heads up. Heck, I might have even ordered it even knowing, but when I took a sip of my tea, expecting a familiar taste only to find that I had been fooled. \n\nMy food was good, but maybe it was just because I was so starved by the time it arrived that I would have enjoyed a shoe just as much. \n\nI can say ONE positive thing about Mezzo, and it's that their Pizza Frittes dessert is PHENOMENAL! They're fried dough bites with powered sugar, similar to bits of funnel cake. I ordered mine to go (since we had been there so long that I felt like I had moved into the place), and they piled them high in the take out box. They were even good the next day. I would go back to Mezzo just for the Pizza Frittes but definitely get them to go....without the tea.
4;Awesome selection of vintage clothes for men and women.  Many sizes. Many colors! So cute! and the staff actually wears the clothing! :D great time! \n\nCHECK IT while you're in Las Vegas!
4;Great customer service. I got mega roast beef sandwich. It looks and taste good. I would buy that again. So much selection. I have to go back to taste every one of them lol. I would come back for another sandwich next time.
2;"Mystere was my first Cirque show. It is a wild, colorful, well performed show. The acts are impressive; they're performed by true athletes and artists. But, I have to say that I preferred O to Mystere. I liked the storyline better. Mystere is very abstract as other posters have stated, so you might want to research it a bit before going in, so you don't feel lost. I'm glad I saw it. I just wish I knew what was going on the whole time. Still, I am in awe of all of the performers."
4;This makes my top three favorite restaurants in town, for sure. I've been there three times already this month. \n\nThe most important thing I think I can say is be specific about your dislikes! You write down what you *don't* like, not what you do, so if your palate is somewhat high maintenance, that needs to be communicated.\n\nDon't go if you're on a time crunch. If you're there before 5:30, the sunset discount is $15 off! And sitting at the bar is super awesome, especially on a slow night. \n\nTheir foie gras torchon is the best I've ever had, and Chef Josh always has awesome wine recommendations! This place is a must-try for foodies.
3;happy hour is great. half off on the entr\u00e9e. had the California roll and the creamy rock shrimp tempura. damn it was delicious. the only thing weird is they had us sit at the lounge area. so dining was a bit awkward. our server seemed not too happy when we asked if we can move to a table. other than that i'll hit it up for some happy hour again
3;Since moving here, I've been to 3 locations with Dim Sum and Golden Buddha has the Best Dim Sum  in the Valley. I tried the Phoenix Palace Buffet and wasn't impressed. C-Fu Gourmet was alright. \n\nI've been to Golden Buddha twice now, LOVE IT. Last Sunday, I ordered 2 Shu Mai's (pork dumplings) 1 order of Shrimp Dumplings, 1 order of Shrimp Balls (crispy wontons wrapped around shrimp) and an order of the Noodles stuffed with Shrimp and the sauce poured over...My tab? Under $20 bucks...Impressive.\n\nAuthentic as it gets.
3;"Came here a couple years ago with my cousin for his haircut; so it was the first place that came to mind that was nearby when I needed my own cut.\n\nWas around Noon on a weekday when I walked in and was able to sit right down and get things going. Marina asked me what I wanted and got right to it. It turned out very well.\n\nI really enjoyed the foam and straight razor to trim the neck and sides. The little massage at the end was pretty great as well.\n\nI've been shaving my own head for about 10-13 years. If I continue to keep the hair growing, I'll definitely be coming back."
4;Great meal!!!! Started with the seafood plateau and finished with the filet. They nailed it!
0;I knew beforehand that going to best buy wouldn't be a good time, but I needed a charger for an electronic device ASAP. I brought the device with me and after trying for about 10 minutes, I was able to hunt someone down to help me. He took me to the section, opened the box and took out the charger and attached to my device. It was a little loose but he said I could just return it if it didn't work. \nNow it is certainly my fault for not knowing their return policy when purchasing, but it's 15 days. I came in three days late to return it (it didn't work) and they refused to return it. She said they could have still returned it, but in had been opened (I purchased it already opened from the store!!) I get that the return policy is 15 days, but come on. Any other store would have still done the return for a customer and at least offered store credit. I'm surprised they haven't gone out of business yet.
1;A cute tour, but a bit too much on the schlock and and pretend and a little light on real history. It was very cool seeing the streets and houses that used to be above ground, but I wished for more time (and more light!) to see things and more explanation about the history and how they figure things out.
2;This restaurant has been in the area since the early 1980's.  However, they've been keeping up with renovations so it's clean and up to date.  I hadn't been to this particular restaurant in 25 years so I was pleased to see that it was doing well.\n\nWe arrived just before the dinner rush, so we were seated immediately.  The service was excellent.  Our water and iced tea were kept full and the warm bread was replenished.\n\nI had the fish and chips.  My husband had the salmon.  My son had the seafood platter.  \n\nMy husband felt his portion was too small, the fish was overcooked, and the pilaf was too salty.  He felt we paid too much for what we got.  He was also unimpressed with the beer selection.  He prefers brew pubs.  At Red Lobster he drank iced tea.\n\nMy son, who is 11, gobbled up his food and exclaimed over how good it was.  But he's a kid, and he tends to have different tastes.\n\nI felt my fish and chips were perfect and while it was expensive, it was competitive with other restaurants.  It's always pricey to eat out, and if you want seafood you have to pay for it.  If I want to run out to a family restaurant for fish and chips and a glass of iced tea, this place is fine.  My husband says he is still looking for the right seafood restaurant.
2;I would give it more stars, but I don't want the bar to get too crowded.
2;It's really hit or miss here depending on who you get to cut your hair. I got 10' of my hair cut off for locks of love, and it was just a super basic hair cut, like straight across. I've had my hair styled well here also, but one time I had a terrible experience and almost started crying and asked to switch haircutters half way through. That was a couple year ago, and I haven't seen the guy around, so hopefully he's gone.\n\nI love that they shampoo your hair with a haircut though! Something that Supercuts does not do, but should
0;"Tried ordering breakfast in the drive thru. When I asked the kid for a \""croissant breakfast sandwich\"" he said \""I can't hear you.\"" Then I spoke a little louder and said \""croissant breakfast sandwich\"" and the kid responded \"" a breakfast sandwich with the softest of bread?\"" This miscommunication went back-and-forth another three times. This is the second time I've had a problem with this place long ago I tried getting breakfast here and it wasn't very good I had coupons that came in the mail sent but those coupons weren't honored when I got to the window.  The kid took the coupons from me but then after he took my credit card as well he did nothing about the coupons I'm assuming just threw them away and charge the full amount to my credit card by the time I realized it was pulling out of the drive through I was irritated. I called the manager and they assured me that they would make it right but they never did even after I went through the trouble of getting them all the information off of my receipt and now after trying to give them a second chance I see no option but to leave this terrible review.  Don't go here."
4;Wow, never have I though that pub food could be this delicious. Cornish Pasty Co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple, affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food.\n\nThe menu is impressively varied, from typical, premium to signature pasties. I went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight.\n\nThere is no host/hostess at the entrance, so you can either seat yourself at the bar, and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter!\n\nThe service is warm, friendly and efficient. Dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25.
1;Service - some good, some awful\n\nFood - Ok, nothing great\n\nI sat at the bar for lunch, which was a little more than half full.  Unfortunately there was only one bar tender working, and she was having to move very fast to try to keep up with everything going on.  \n\nI ordered an appetizer and a sandwich - after about 15 minutes the sandwich arrived, but no appetizer.  The runner called over the bar tender, and they offered to take the sandwich back and keep it warm until I was ready for it - I said no, I would take the sandwich and they should take the appetizer off the bill.  After I was done with the sandwich and fries, waiting for check, the appetizer came out, and tried to get me to take it to go.  I was out for the day, and I wasn't going to leave the food in the car on a 100 degree day to spoil.\n\nThe cajun sandwich was tasty, but greasy and too messy - plan on having several pieces falling out of the sandwich (and chances are down your shirt)\n\nwas a disappointment to say the least
1;"It's just okay, and with all the other options around I do not recommend this one.  Especially for the money.  \n\nAll that butter in the mussels was pretty weird, otherwise they were alright.  What was no alright is when the server took the shell bowl away midway through without providing a new one.  The service had the right intent, but execution was off.  \n\nAnd there's the odd issue about not taking food with us, mentioned elsewhere here on Yelp.  I'm sure usually a non-issue, but off putting, baseless, and out of place nonetheless.  Eggs overdone; tuna was alright; artichoke dip mediocre and bland."
2;A friend and I went to our first workout here last night. The staff are super friendly, and its a chic place, not to mention super convenient, if you're always zipping around to Whole Paycheck (otherwise known as Foods) as I do.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what it was that we were expecting, but it wasn't... quite this. It's not an aerobic workout, in that the exercises utilize very small movements, so it's great for people with joint problems. But, we did hope that it would be more... ballet inspired. This seemed only vaguely related to ballet. \n\nSo, the good: Your muscles burn. Both my friend and I are in reasonably good shape, and we were having serious issues with some of the exercises (in a good way). My hip flexors are still sore. So, if you want to focus specifically on your butt and thighs, this is an excellent workout for you. But moreso than a spin class? Hard to say.\n\nThe bad: The music is so loud, you often have trouble hearing the instructor over it. And, it is sometimes really hard to see what the instructor is doing, because they turn the lights down (maybe they want us to have a dance party vibe in there, I dunno). And, most importantly, for the amount of money they are charging, it just seems ridiculous how little hands on time you get from the instructor. Since so much of the workout relies on technique, it seems like a waste to spend that kind of dough and not know if you are doing it right.\n\nSo, if you're curious, I encourage you to try it out. Take advantage of the free try out special that they are running. It may very well be perfect for you. I may try another class, but it's unlikely.
2;It was pretty good. I had the B.M.OC,pork chop was good. That being said,waffle was soggy from too much syrup. The eggs were well,eggs. The donut thing was ok all in all it was ok I'll go back to try something else. Oh and the coffee was pretty good.
3;"I'll be back!  It smells like old vegas and I love it.  Friendly dealers, plenty of old slots; I hate the new ones; and my friend got regular cocktail service, even at a 15 cent slot machine!  I think the only thing that slowed him was his liver recouperating from the previous casino"
0;I have nothing positive to say about my experience at Firefly on Paradise.  The service was the most awful thing ever.  I was in management for a Forbes rated the hotel for a long time, and I would be seriously embarrassed if my team ever acted like this team.\n\nWe were sat at a table outside, and then we were left for 20 minutes before anyone checked in on us. During this time, all the tables around us were being serviced. I watched the waiter check in with several tables. 25 minutes into this experience the busser brought waters, and the waiter came over. He didn't say Hello, he said what do you want to drink. I was expecting some type of reason why he was ignorning us. The paito wasn't that full.  He took the order and left.  During this time the manager was walking around the patio area.\n\nI also watched the manager of Firefly mingle with what appeared to his friends and several other tables except ours. During this time, the manager made eye contact with me four times (I was giving the look of hey how's it going can you please assist me), but he failed to do anything.  He started to walk our direction, and I was about to speak up to him, but he turned his focus to a table full of young women. The service should be the focus, I can understand if you are speaking with your guests, but this was not the case.  He continued to check in on what appeared to be his friends and tables full of young women. Each time he did this he was chatting it up for several minutes.\n\nWe were still waiting for our drinks at this point about 35 minutes into our experience. At this point, we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks because no one returned with them.  The manager also was at the bar during this interaction and failed to say anything. We mentioned our experience to the bartender and the manager could have said something, but he didn't. \n\nOverall, the waiter seemed mad he had to work, and the only person who was doing anything positive was the busser.  We asked our busser at one point to get send over the waiter so we could order another round.  The busser walked over to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared for several minutes before coming to our table. \n\nDuring this time, the waiter made eye contact with our table, and then walked away. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I then watched him walk inside and stand by a curtain. He wasn't doing anything for a good five minutes, and then he finally came back out, went to another table and walked away.  I had to wave him over, which I hate doing, because it is rude, however, there was no other way to get his attention.  \n\nEventually, our food came out, and the waiter continued to be short with us.  The food was good, but the service at this place was awful. I think the thing that rubbed me the worst about this place was that the manager failed to step in and show any interest in our situation. He seemed consumed with talking to women rather than doing his job.  This was my perception last night.\n\nI hope everyone else doesn't experience this while you are at this establishment. Maybe it was an off night, either way, the service was horrible.  The only reason we didn't leave was because our friend loves Firefly and it was her birthday.  \n\nI also witnessed several staff members on their phones, I can't believe this place...get your standards in with the rest of this city!
4;I am so happy to see Ben in his new office.  He is so knowledgable and can read the body like no other chiropractor I've been to.  He's amazing! My husband and I highly recommend Ben!
2;I ate here for dinner, on a personal recommendation. I'm giving it two and a half stars but will try to give it a shot during lunchtime. For those familiar with the buffet scene in Dane County, eating here made me nostalgic for Taste of Asia buffet on E. Washington that closed down several years ago. Now that was a buffet. Oysy comes close, but maybe this review isn't the space for me to dwell on other restaurants' quality. \n\nThe mussels with creamy white sauce on it was ok, so was the battered shrimp. Eggs food young was so so.  I liked the chow mein. The egg drop soup was especially yellow.  I didn't eat at the dessert aisle, by then I was just stuffed.  \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and so was the youngish looking kid behind the cashier. My fortune cookie was meaningful, so I'll take with me a good memory and the antacid.
1;As soon as we checked in to California hotel & casino, we made our way to Market Street Cafe.  It was already past midnight and we had come from LA so we weren't trying to drive around anymore.  Luckily, it wasn't as crazy busy so we were able to be seated right away.  Unfortunately, despite getting seated right away, we weren't attended to right away at our table.  Don't get me wrong.  The server was nice but when one is tired and hungry, niceness can only get so far.  \n\nWhen she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.\n\nDid I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.  Overall, I probably wouldn't eat here again, unless I had no other choice.
4;Great food here.\n\nBanana Foster's Waffles (might be the best waffles I've had)\nFrench Toast (wife said it was the best french toast she's had)\nCorn Beef with hash browns (corn beef was decent but the hit were the hash browns which had some sort of caramelized onion on it)\n\nAwesome food.  We had a group of 10 (6 adults and 4 kids)
2;Saturday night (8/4/12), dinner time:\n\nI had read several reviews of Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant at Paris before dining there.  One thing people talked about was the unique entranceway into the restaurant, designed to emulate the Chunnel from France into England.  It was interesting but best to appreciate it before you walk in since before the hostess can even finish telling you what the entrance represents, you are already through it and into the bar area.  The bar is separated from the two storied restaurant by a glass wall.  The ground floor eating area is adjacent to an open kitchen which allows the smell of the cooking steaks to permeate the restaurant.  There is a long flight of stairs against one wall leading to a second eating area on the balcony overlooking the restaurant.  After you sit down and take in the surroundings, you being to realize just how loud and blaring the background music is.  You can hardly hear the waiter not to mention the people sitting across the table from you.  I guess the overly loud music is supposed to give an energy to the place but it is too overdone and passes well into the annoying range.\n\nWe started with a half dozen west coast oysters ($20) and a heirloom tomato salad ($18). The oysters were very fresh and come with a trio of sauces: vinaigrette, soy sauce and a traditional red cocktail sauce.  The tomato salad was a medley of sweet tomatoes, prosciutto and watercress.  Both simply presented dishes were very well done.  \n\nFor the second course, we had the asparagus soup ($17) and lobster bisque ($26).  The asparagus soup was served over a central mound of Dungeness crab, celery and smoked salmon caviar.  The soup had a rich asparagus flavor and the subtle crab meat blended well with it.  However, when you were unfortunate enough to bite into one of the cheap orange caviar pearls, the taste was ruined but this intense fishy flavor filling your mouth.  I do like unique combinations of flavor but these tastes did not mesh well at all.  The lobster bisque was served with a whole portion of shelled lobster tail meat sitting in a very flavorful brown lobster broth.  The meat was buttery and perfectly cooked. Clearly, this was a well thought out dish and earned the high recommendation the waiter gave it when suggesting entrees.\n\nFor dinner, we had the roasted Beef Wellington (one of Gordon's signature dishes at $52) and the fish and chips ($42).  The Wellington was served already sliced down the middle on a layer of very creamy mashed potatoes.  There were puddles of a dark brown, very salty demi-glace splashed around the dish and a small pile of glazed root vegetables.  Overall, the dish was good however not one to order if you like your meat well done.  As it is, I like my meat medium rare so the very pink interior didn't bother me.  The fish and chips however were a greasy mess.  The fish filets are served breaded and fried with their tails on.  The two filets are plated on top of several large dollops of tarter sauce.  The dish comes with a small side of truffle oil fries.  The first thing you notice however is the somewhat unappetizing fishy smell.  I'm sure the fish was fresh (it better be for $42) so perhaps they are reusing the oil to fry batch after batch.  I suppose it is somewhat ironic to complain that a fish dish smelled fishy but it was unappetizing to have your food smell like an old fisherman's net.  When you cut into the fish, the next thing you notice is the oil pouring out around your knife and fork.  Combined with the creamy tarter sauce, this is a heavy, heavy greasy dish.  It tastes all-right but it will sit on your belly for the rest of the night.  If you have plans later, it is probably best to avoid this particular entree.\n\nFor desert, we had the sticky toffee pudding ($13), a small French pressed coffee ($8) and a double espresso ($8).  The pudding is served along side of a small cup filled with extra molten toffee to pour over the pudding and a rectangular block of butter flavored ice cream, made to look like a stick of butter.  Unfortunately, there was so much butter in the ice cream, it also tasted like a cold stick of butter.  The pudding was very sweet, almost too sweet, such that after a few bites, you feel like you need an injection of insulin.  The whole dish is gaudy, in-your-face butter and sugar.  We stopped eating it after a few bites.\n\nThe waiter did a good job and came by often during the meal.  However, you can only hear half of what they are saying to you due to the excessively loud music. It was amusing to look around and see different waiters around the restaurant leaning in to repeat things to other diners.  Doesn't the manager also notice things like this? Overall, the food was ok but was certainly not worth the excessive price tag.  You are basically paying extra for the name and hoping the food lives up to the reputation.  Unfortunately, the entire experience falls short.
4;This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room, the Madison Lakes Room, was huge and the bathroom was spectacular. I loved the steam shower! The property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day. They are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book. The breakfast was great, I think we had 3 courses a day of food. Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal. Their dog Happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property.\n\n They do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime. There are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies!
0;I love starbucks and i love coffee but here my caramel macchiato shot was burnt and bitter the two times I have been here. So far the only Starbucks that screwed up my drink. I rather just go down the road and find another one a few blocks away.
3;Great deal for breakfast/lunch. The food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you weren't eating straight heavy fat. GO HERE!
3;My husband and I stayed here as a weekend getaway in the beginning of July.  Let's start with the downsides to this place.  Everywhere you go is a hike.  It is built into the side of a mountain so the parking spaces and rooms are very far away and a long walk (up hill) from all the pools and restaurants.  Parking is another issue all together.  We never had an issue (thankfully) but the parking by the actual rooms was scarce and the main parking is quite far from the rooms if you were unfortunate enough to not find a space.  Also, the bar in the adult pool wasn't open at night which was highly inconvenient and we ended up going to a bar off site.\n\nThe Pros... the place is gorgeous.  The rooms are top notch, the sheets and bed were super comfortable and we were very well rested by the end of our stay.  The pools are very well maintained and there are a bunch of them.  The room service was delicious and the onsite dining at Pointe in Tyme was amazing as well.\n\nAlso, we had arrived with the expectation that free wifi would not be available, but it turns out it is included in the $10/night resort fee we were charged so that was a pleasant surprise.\n\nI would 100% return in the future!
3;"It's hard to find good banh mi in this town. I was excited to find a place with pretty good reviews. \n\nThe pickled veggies were perfect and the bread was just how I like it; soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I would have preferred they not use mayonnaise as the condiment of choice and I'll know for next time to request it with no mayo and peppers on the side. \n\nAll in all, I was happy with my inexpensive dinner choice.\n\n...and, oh joy, it tastes just as good the next day!  Yay leftovers."
4;I've seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows, and I think after O, this is my second favorite.  Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.\n\nA lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.\n\nOn the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.  But whether you're familiar with the Beatles' or not, you're sure to leave entertained.
1;I really wanted to really like this place.\n\nI have gone there twice during my visit here...\n\nFirst off, when asked what you would like to drink, if you say water, it's a bit alarming when the waitress asks (tells) you, are you sure you wouldn't like a lemon in that water?  It's cause the water they serve tastes terrible.  Seriously.\n\nSecond, I'm a huge fan of Kreplach soup.  So when I saw it on their menu, I got rather excited.  That excitement didn't last for long.  The Kreplach looked like they were mass produced, all identical, not hand made.  They were skinny.  Don't bother ordering it.\n\nIf you order a half sandwich, the cole slaw that comes with it, well, you need a magnifying glass to see it... really, why provide a serving in a thimble?  It's a shame, cause the cole slaw actually was good.\n\nThe corned beef sandwiches were ok, they seem to get pleasure out of their size... for $13 or whatever, I expect them to be big.  They were good, not great, but good.\n\nThe entrance is a dizzy array of the check in area, the register area, the take out area, and a merchandising area.  The seating area is pretty plain.\n\nAll in all, if this is Tempe's definition of a wantabee Jewish deli, it has the advantage to most places away from the two coasts, but it really doesn't pass the appearance or taste test.  Better than none, I'll concede that.\n\nBut disappointed, perhaps cause it bills itself as something it's not...
0;"Meh. I love Cirque, in fact I'd count myself as a super fan (having seen every show that I can get to in LA, Vegas, NYC or SF). I first saw Zumanity back in 2004-ish. It was sexy, fun, entertaining and sure adult, just enough, perfect. So I took my husband for his birthday (dinner and a show in Vegas, nice ;-). We both left disappointed and with raging headaches. Where was the Cirque in this show? I saw drag, boobs, lewd jokes and minor acro feats. What I missed was the charm, the sensuality and awe that most Cirque shows offer in spades. You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if it's raunch go elsewhere, if it's Cirque try O. To the Cirque team- try harder to stay on brand and revert back to the show as it was 10 years ago or take your name off this show. Zumanity is not worth the time or money, sorry."
3;"I keep waiting to review Industry until I've had the opportunity to eat here, but I can wait NO longer!  \n\nLast night was my second visit and I continue to be impressed with the service and atmosphere.  Watching the bartenders make their fancy schmancy drinks is truly a treat.  Not only is it entertaining to watch, but damn, does it make you thirsty for some smoke-treated whiskey. Really.  The atmosphere is so lovely; dark, but not too dark, great televisions if you're trying to watch a game, comfy bar-stools (even though they don't look it) and enough room to breathe.  Heading there next weekend for a birthday dinner and I can't WAIT to eat, eat, eat all of the delicious food on their super-unique menu!"
4;"Busy...Lunch crowd they make killer chicken \""strips\"" at least its not mystery meat. Good location next to Twin Peaks at Concord Mills seems to be a busy busy area as of late 4 bars added . a Adam and Eve and hotels just down the road what more can you ask for?"
0;"Received rubber flooring rolls and upon unrolling them noticed they were not laying flat along one edge (all three). The rolls were obviously defective and were a liability to the gym members-- a tripping hazard. Members were calling them the new \""bacon\"" mats because of the waves along the edges. After providing the company with photos and expressing my disapointment, Alex was very understanding and told me the issue would be resolved within 48 hours. After 48 hours , his tone changed, avoiding my emails, giving vague answers, and even blaming me for installing them improperly. It has been a week since I've heard from them and have lodged a complaint with American Express."
1;my food had no flava.......& my lava cake was burnt!!!!
0;"Took Expedition in for inspection.  Got the call that everything passed except for front ball joints.... Cost???  $645!!!  Ball joints from Autozone cost $34 each.  I asked the mechanic doing the inspection how far out of spec the joints were... He couldn't give me a spec... Only that in his opinion, it was too loose.  I told them I would get the work done myself, citing the cost of the ball joints, to which he replied, \""well, we're not the lowest cost on the block.\"". \n\nI got the joints replaced for 1/5 of the estimate from Firestone.... And 2 mechanics that I went to both indicated they would not have failed the inspection for those joints.\n\nSo here is the point... My experience with this shop might be out of the ordinary, but it is the experience you dread when taking your automobile in for a mandated inspection.  My advice is to get a second opinion when a shop like this springs something like this on you.  Unfortunately, most people just pay the price and go on.  If you are able to get a second opinion, I would encourage it.\n\nThe workers at this shop are friendly.  Like I said, I hope my experience was an anomaly... But I won't be back, even though the location is very convenient to where I live. \n\nBtw... The truck passed inspection when I took it back in."
1;Disappointed in this sandwich bar.  I had a salad which was ok - nothing to brag about.  I was disappointed that the menu only had hot subs - no cold sandwiches.
2;KOBE BEEF TACOS!!!! Melts in your mouth, literally. The tacos came with a pineapple salsa that I didnt think was gonna go good with it but they made the tacos and I usually dont like fruity salsas.  Girlfriend got the chicken enchiladas and they werent that hot (good). It had a pablano puree and it wasnt that tasty and didnt go with the enchiladas. \n\nThe staff was really good and friendly, the server knew a lot about the courses and how they were prepared. \n\nAmbiance was, eh. Personally didnt really like it. \n\nAll in all, I would go again but would be scared to venture the menu and would stick with the kobe beef tacos.
2;I usually stay at the Monte Carlo. I like the location and it's easy to find your way around.  I'm not giving up on the Monte Carlo just yet but they have some issues with maintenance and housekeeping.  The carpets are dirty and the bathroom has issues that would make Bob Vila crap his pants. That said, none of these issues were bad enough to repack my clothes and ask for another room. It's Vegas who stays in their room for a long
2;I lovvvve BBQ and I was super excited to find out that this place is in Old Town. Yay! They have a parking lot so it's not the nightmare I was expecting. I automatically adore any joint that serves drinks in a mason jar. \n\nThe pork ribs were really tender, not too fatty, and really flavorful. The corn bread was so soft that I thought I was taking a bite out of a cloud. Like the atmosphere, the 5 cheese mac isn't much too be desired so skip that for sure. \n\nWe waited forever...50 minutes... for our food. It was kind of crazy because the place wasn't busy at all. Yes, good food does take time...but they need to put a few more crayons on the table (you can color on the tablecloth!) to keep me occupied. We got to be really restless. Also, it was a little upsetting that 10 minutes before our food came the manager (who was very friendly) let my friend know that they were out of what she ordered...sliced brisket. So she was served the chopped up brisket used for a sandwich. She couldn't let us know this as soon as the order was put in? \n\nI heard zero country jams while I was in there. How does that work? Earl's is good...but it certainly isn't the best.
3;loved to ambience. great food. average drinks.
2;I've dined here on a few occasions. Lunch has been fantastic! We had Croque Monsieur and Quiche Lorraine.  Dinner has been hit or miss, I suggest sticking with the steaks - the porterhouse for two was great. Haven't had much luck with the seafood or other red meats. Don't miss the cheese plates, they're excellent anytime.
4;Me and my husband LOVE LOVE Nello's! We have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out!
2;"This only gets a 3 because the cheese's and meats are really quite good, but everything is really average and the service is nothing special.  Try the cheese selection, go for seven as you can order 3, 5 or 7 and you end up ordering 7 in the end and if you order 3 and then another 3 it's more expensive than ordering 7.  We ate here twice on our 5 day stay, the first time we went we had the 7 cheese's ( if they have the robiola, get a few of them, it's so good, kind of like a sweeter, softer, milder saint andre)  the arancini, and 2 pasta's.  Again the cheese were good, but it's not like they're making it so whatever.  You'll get 3 accompanyments with your cheese and bread; black truffle honey, apricot mustardo and brandy preserved cherries.  You only get 3-5 cherries and you'll need more so order them right away, beware they only sell them by the 10's and it's $5 for 10 small (very small cherries)  Losen up on the purse string Batalli!  We ended up loving the cherries so much that we bought a jar for $35, they're jars are not seeled they'll put them in a mason jar for you to take home.\nThe arancini were terrible, although my husband didn't mind them.  The pasta was gross... I can't remember what is was and we also had the veal meatball with a polenta sauce, again not so good.  It was moist and tender but seriously lacked flavor.  We also had the \""pick me up\"" which is sort of a deconstructed tiramisu with expresso gelato, it was good, not great.  The second time we went we went straight to meats and cheese, paid too much for cherries again (server was a little annoying), had the tiramisu thing again and that was that.   3 because the entree's were really bad."
1;"I live downtown and was sooooo excited that we had yet another restaurant to visit..... especially since it is the same owner as AZ88 which I love!  \n\nWent for lunch with my bf and we both started out with a martini.  Mine had St. Germain in it and I couldn't wait!  We waited... and waited.... they finally came and wow... they were in miniature glasses.  Not so happy about the size.  When you order a martini... it should be in a standard martini glass.  They were tasty though, so we ordered a sandwich and a margarita pizza.  Meanwhile, a table of 4 sat down about 5 minutes after us.  Later when the server finally came with their wine bottle and 4 glasses they had already left.  The table next to us told the waitress \""I guess they got tired of waiting\"". \n\nAll in all, the food was average, pleasant decor, however, the service needs work.  I look forward to giving Hanny's another shot but will wait a couple of months."
1;So, Jolly Bob's is now closed, and I was in search of something to fill the massive hole it left in my heart (and stomach). Sadly, Jamerica just did not do that.\n\nImmediately, I liked the vibe: chill, serve yourself a beverage from the cooler, motherly figure waiting on you. But that was kind of it. The rest was disappointing.\n\nI ordered the chicken curry and a Jamaican beef patty to start, and was then told they were out of both. So I switched to a veggie patty and BBQ chicken. My companions ordered Mango Rundown Tofu and Jerk Chicken.\n\nThe BBQ chicken was good, but nothing particularly amazing. The sauce was spicy and not too sweet. The tofu was pretty good, but really sweet, and between the tofu, stewed veggies, and rice, it was all the kind of the same texture. The jerk chicken was best: spiced well and tender. The sides, rice and beans and stir fried veggies were nothing spectacular, but they rounded out the plate.\n\nOverall, it was just kind of underwhelming. Probably won't be rushing back any time soon.
1;I'm not sure about all of the hype surrounding this restaurant/gas station/car wash.  It's really a strange concept. I can understand why they sell what they do as it is the age old trick of impulse buying while you wait.  The difference is that their items are typically higher end than what you might find in a typical car wash.  I think it has something to do with the neighborhood it is in.\n\nWhen it comes to the restaurant, they can do better.  I had the crab cake salad.  It was a very small portion..... two small crab cakes, chopped tomatoes a little chopped green pepper and that was it.  This was all for $11.  My friend had the cuban sandwich.  He said it wasn't anything special and it didn't include a side dish.  When going out to lunch, I usually look for something that provides a bit more.
2;"Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \""afterparty\"" but I would rather stick to the main clubs."
0;Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them.
3;I liked their crab legs. I was second in a huge forming line. They are cracked, so no work has to be done. Sushi was very fresh. They have really cute bite sized desserts, so you can sample a lot of things. The dessert section is hidden away from everything else, so I think there is a good chance a lot of people forget about it. They have gellato in many different flavors like sour cherry. Very cute desserts. I don't know what kind of dessert I was eating. White chocolate with edible silver balls and soft center. Good what ever it was. I am very picky, and I found a lot of stuff I could eat. However for the price, I think I like the Bellagio better. Their is also a buffet on the stip with circular aquariums at the buffet with tropical desserts that are out of this world. Just can't remember the name of it :( I just remember you take an esculator down to get to the buffet. If you love Sushi Todai is a great fish and sushi buffet for reasonable prices. They have chicken and beef too!
0;Worst service ever!!!!\nThis office doesn't answer phone calls. They were supposed to pick us up from the hotel and never showed up. This office should be closed!
0;The rooms are actually very modern and nice. I had two separate rooms for my group.  Three bay suite and a two bay suite. So why they 1 star? Its not the staff. Its the casino allowing smoking anywhere and everywhere. Its the pool party with DJ on Saturdays. If you want to see white trash at its finest, go ahead. People throwing up, cops throwing people out, people having sex in the bushes....give me a break. What a joke.
0;"We stayed at the Flamingo last week since my friend had a free night from the last time he was booked there.  During that time, the front desk lost his reservation and apparently was very unhelpful with finding him another spot to stay...leaving him stranded to fend for himself on his first night in Vegas.\n\nWe got a late flight so checked in at 11:30pm (after an hour long wait).  the room we requested was unavailable, even though we called ahead of time to make sure they still had our reservation and our room.  They preceded to check us into a temporary room with a room change to be made the next morning.  Renee on the front desk was a sweetheart and the only person in the hotel who really seemed to care.  We preceded up to our room and all of a sudden I started coughing and sneezing and was having a severe allergic reaction.  My friend went out in the hallway to get ice and noticed we were in one of the only \""Pet Friendly\"" rooms in the hotel.  I have severe allergies to pets and no one informed us that it was a pet room.  We called down and were placed on hold for 15 mins when we decided to not waste our first night there and hung up to head downstairs to the casino.  We came back to our room at an obscene hour only to find ourselves locked out of our room.  I guess the reasoning was that they changed our room and keys but neglected to tell us this.\n\nThe next morning we phoned front desk to see if our room was ready.  They gave us a timeline of 1pm but when we went to get our new room keys,  the room was still not ready.  Were were given a fantastic room on the 20th floor with a strip view, which is what we wanted in the first place. The only plus of this whole experience.\n\nWhen we checked out we had a charge of 160$ in internet...OUT OF THIS WORLD.  when we explained to them how disappointed we were, and how the internet barely worked, the front desk (including supervisor) refused to do anything about it.  They also blamed us for not reading the terms and conditions or telling them about my allergy.  Internet is charged per person per location, so 3 charges were from our initial room., and another 3 from the new room..in the same day.  We had to ask for the number to the internet company and call from our Canadian cell phones because apparently all the phones in the Flamingo are for in house, which I know is a complete lie.  I work in a hotel and this is by far the WORST customer service I've ever received. If the Flamingo is supposed to be this wonderful \""centre of the strip, historic, Vegas resort\"", the staff should stand beside it. We never heard an apology out of anyone.  The internet company ended up taking off the charges for us, and could not believe that the front desk did nothing about it.\n\nI will NOT stay here again, even though the casino, restaurants and rooms were great for the price.  Customer service is #1 and I was overly disappointed with the service received."
0;2nd attempt at this place. The only reason we did go back is that we had a gift certificate (which is now useless).   Aftef the disappointment a few weeks back we decided fo call to be sure they had a cook on duty and we could get something to eat.  They told us they would be serviing appetizers until 7pm.  We got there about 2:30 and asked the bartender/manager if they had a cook there and got a completely different story than the one on the phone.  Not only do they no longer serve lunch or dinner but they don't even serve appetizers.  What a crock of ____!!!  How can they ever stay in business?  People want food when they are drinking.  The manager gave us a story that they bought only the bar and the restaurant was a separate entity..We will definitely not be going back for the 3rd time nor ever again. Kiss my certificate goodbye!!!!!!
0;"What a joke! I had high hopes when I saw the Illy sign and read the menu...what a let down. The service and food were both horrible. I had a sandwich from the specials menu...a Pesto chicken sandwich; for starters it took too long to get the food...broiled pre-cooked chicken, plastic bag puree avocado, flavorless bread! If this place was in SF it would fail---but that's true for most places in Vegas---what passes for food here is a joke. Oh and before you say I don't understand French cuisine....I'm half French, half Italian, and travel to Europe every other year for the past 12 years."
0;Do not wash your car at this place. The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.  He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right. This place is no good be warned.
1;The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\n\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.
0;Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do.
3;I love this place! I have a problem with their crappy customer service via their website and how they don't allow long ranting complaints (which I have, but will set aide). They have a text limit, so when I wrote my awesome e-mail from my phone to send, at the end, it said their website couldn't process my complaint at the time... I tried from my computer writing a new e-mail (since the other one was erased), but that one wouldn't submit either. Then I sent a 1 word e-mail. Hey! That went through! Apparently, they want to hear your comments, just not long ones. My friend also wrote an e-mail stating that she wanted to set up a PARTY to come to this theater. No reply. I'd say they should improve that. Moving on to the awesomeness.\n\nFULL sized reclining chairs. They are comfy and lush, and actually served as a nice nap area when Epic (Disney's attempt at making an epic movie) got boring. I love their reserved seating option (which doesn't work on the mobile version, so make sure to click on full site, or book from a computer). The people who work here seem to really like their job and I like the usher that tells jokes while we're waiting for the previews. Ticket prices are the same if not lower than others. I took my kids here and they were in love. Now when I'm sitting at another movie theater, I just wish I could be reclining instead. I am definitely a fan, even after I let them eat up $30 for Ironman 3D on top of my other Ironman movie tickets (I paid a total of $54 to watch Ironman 3. It wasn't worth it). Come! Reserve your seats so it doesn't matter if you're late. Bring a blankie. Enjoy!
4;fried chicken -------b-a-n-a-n-a-s
1;I guess maybe because they have a great location Z Tejas doesnt think it has too work that hard anymore.  I was there with a large group and we were all extremely disappointed across the board.  The service was really slow (even with the bar being slow) and almost non existent.  It took so long to get drinks that some people were questioning if they had ordered or not.  We had dirty plates and old drinks on our table that we couldnt get rid of even when we piled them up and shoved them all to the corner of the table. The food took even longer.  20+ minutes for shrimp tostada bites and the had clearly been sitting for a bit since the shrimp was cold.  Chicken burritos with minimal chicken-if you ask for more beware you will be charged 8 more bucks for it!!   The cheese quesadilla didnt have enough cheese either.  I was very disappointed and will not return.  The only plus was sitting on the patio.  maybe the service is better during there prime hours but it should be the same all the time, right?
3;Great French onion soup and French dip sand
0;Bleh.  This place isn't even good when you are drunk.
0;I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask.
0;I purchased a jar of palm sugar . I had it in my pantry for about 3 weeks. I opened it today and there was mole flowing on top of the sugar & lid of the jar. I took it back to the store to exchange it. The store clerk refuse to exchange it because I did not have my receipt. I explained to him that I have never had problem with purchases from the store . And I shop there 2 time a week & was accumulating so many receipts I decide not to keep them. He was very rude and lie to me there was no manger in the store. I will be reporting them to the Southern Nevada Health District.
4;the last time i was here 4 years ago i was still eating meat, and i fondly remember how good it was so i just have to go back. we had a bottle of the Col Solare and i love how it's not too dry and not too sweet for a red wine. for the appetizer, we had the tuna on a himalayan salt block - perfect tuna sashimi texture, and i love how you rub each slice on the block for additional flavor/saltiness. for the main course i had the grilled salmon beurre blanc - the salmon and the mussels were very fresh, and the creamy wild mushroom risotto was very flavorful. our table also ordered the deconstructed rib eye and i was told it was fantastic also. our perfect dinner wouldnt be complete without dessert, so we ordered the 6 flavor sorbet shooters (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, coconut, and mango), and the coconut cake (im not a coconut fan but this one is very subtle, not too sweet, very refreshing). The manager, William Wilson, was very friendly and warm and attended to our whole dining experience. I recommend this place to all my friends. Very happy and satisfied customer here. :)
2;This is one of those places where the food looks better than it taste.  It doesn't taste horrible, but definitely not as good as it looks.  \n\nMy favorites were the miso butterfish, kimchi fried rice and tuna sashimi salad.  It's a great place for you to try many different (small) appetizers at an efficient cost.  The vibe feels very Japanese, as if you really are in Japan, which was something I liked.  \nIt's a fun experience, but I didn't feel like it hit the spot when I walked out the door.  Probably won't come back to try different items, just my favorites.
4;"I think I actually felt the story and history of Titanic, the \""ship of dreams\"" with all my heart during my visit. I wanted to visit this exhibition so bad because it was our one year anniversary and 100th anniversary of Titanic, it was just such a touching and romantic thing to do! \n\nThe tickets are $32 each for adult, they have photographers take photos for visitors with 3 backgrounds. The scene in the very front of the ship from the movie, the portrait of the big piece of Titanic, and the re-creation of the Grand Staircase. You can decide if you want those photos after your visit. They don't allow cameras inside, all the phones have to be turned off as soon as you enter the exhibition. \n\nThe 25,000-square-feet exhibit was fantastic! I loved it how they re-created the first and third class rooms. We could actually walk through it, even the furnishings were by original manufacturers. Lots of recovered artifacts from Titanic, lots of detailed descriptions about the ship and passengers, even the stories about survivors and victims. \n\nI was surprised first class suite cost that much money per person for this voyage, more than $50,000 a suite in today's money value! In the movie Kate's fianc\u00e9e must be so wealthy to book 3 suites! And how luxury the first class areas were, only they had running water, and everything was as luxury as Ritz. Wow.. Amazing! \n\nI almost lost words at The Grand Staircase ... It was just like in the movie! My favorite set! We got to walk up and take a photo, my dream came true! The actual big piece of Titanic was so surreal to me, I couldn't believe it was an actual piece from the ship! And the rest of the ship in the bottom of North Atlantic Ocean is going to disappear in a decade or two from decaying. \n\nIt was very educational that they showed us when Titanic hit the iceberg, why, and how she had no chance but to sink....and why many passengers died from the cold so fast in North Atlantic Ocean, the water was even colder than the iceberg they put there for visitors to touch and feel, it was freezing! Most passengers suffered psychological and physical panics in the water, their body temperatures dropped very fast, so that they died even faster in the water..... so sad.....And they re-created the moonless night on the deck when Titanic hit the iceberg. I swear I could feel something around me, I hope they were not spirits or something... \n\nThis exhibit was just too touching, too real, I had tears in my eyes, I couldn't imagine how people went through all that, such a great tragedy... I even told hubby that I would never get on a life boat without him, just like Kate & Jack in the movie! Well, I am just a hopeless romantic! \n\nThey had a visitors book for us to write our thoughts about our visit. A gift shop to get something to take home of this amazing Titanic artifact exhibition. \n\nAbsolutely loved this exhibit, can't even describe how much I enjoyed it, it was really a romantic thing to do for couples, I highly recommend it!"
1;The pictures on the internet all doctored up and nice looking really had us fooled!\n\nAs soon as we walked in we knew this place would be way more ghetto than the pictures.  Smelled gross.  Other people staying in the hotel were pretty ghetto as well.  Reservations screwed up when we checked in resulting in us having to wait awhile.  Room wasn't too bad and the king size bed was nice.  \n\nHaving to walk half a block to get to the parking lot was a pain.  Having the hotel connected to what I believe was a bus station led to lots of fun interactions with bums and vagrants!\n\nI thought the in hotel restaraunt was going to blow but it was actually the best part!\n\nMEHHHHHHHH you get what you pay for i guess
4;Came in for 3 nights. I was upgraded to a suite on the 11th floor overlooking the Wynn Golf course - Awesome views.\n\nThe hotel has  new management and a new food manager. The customers service has always been solid in the past but they staff has really stepped up their game. Even the food in the club lounge has really gone upscale in the evenings. I've experienced many Marriott's family hotels and this location has some of the best tasting food for a club lounge. Medallions of beef, shrimp lettuce wraps,  shrimp poke on shredded lettuce, lobster mac & cheese, tilapia with capers and lemon sauce were some of the food offered for three evenings. The desserts were also impressive over baked cookies - one evening they had flan and another evening yummy warm bread pudding. In the morning the club lounge installed a pancake machine to where I just pushed a button and within seconds two pancakes popped onto my plate. \n\nOverall I was impressed more so then previous stays and I'm looking forward to returning.
4;"My husband and I recently found out that the same people that owned Mama's now own this restaurant. Being regulars at Mama's we decided we had to go. As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted by the hostess who was very nice and friendly. The food was wonderful. We tried the mussels in a red sauce as our appetizer and they were outstanding. We also had the lasagna and the chicken don carlo. Both were excellent and there was plenty to take home for the next day. The service was fabulous, our waitress Samantha was amazing. She was very attentive without being overbearing and annoying. We had been to Fontanella's a few times before the new ownership; however the food was never this good. We will definitely be coming back."
2;Open 11am-9pm. Greek guys doing white broccoli & white shrimp pizzas with buffalo wings, hot & cold subs, calzones, stromboli's, ziti, lasagna, chic parm, spaghetti. Free limited delivery
2;"I've been here a few times now for the unlimited sushi deal.  It's pretty easy to get your money's worth.  However, like most places on campus, the sushi just isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.\n\nI always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty."
3;We recently stayed at the Encore for 3 nights as a part of a packaged deal which included a 3 night stay, 2 tickets to La Reve, and a $25 dollar slot machine credit (which I promptly lost in about 20 minutes).  \n\nOverall, the hotel was very nice.  The lobby and casino decor is very gaudy, as is the Wynn, but since that's what they're going for, I won't hold it against them.  The hotel rooms and hallways were lovely.  Our room was beautiful and comfortable, although the view of down town Las Vegas left a bit to be desired.  Don't listen to those warnings from the front desk about noise from the club.  Get the view of the strip and wear some earplugs.\n\nThe pools were fantastic.  Very beautiful and plenty of chairs to be had.  If it hadn't been so hot we would have stayed out there longer and rented a cabana, of which there are tons.  The casino itself was nice, and smelled good, which is an accomplishment, but not much different than the other hotels in this class.\n\nAlthough the hotel was nice, our customer service experience was a bit disappointing.  When we checked in, we were offered a selection of about 5 available rooms.  When we chose one on the 34th floor, we got our keys and headed up.  Upon arriving, we noticed a $20 bill and some change sitting on the desk, and then an open bottle of lotion on a table, and when I looked in the bathroom and saw multiple personal belongings on the counter, it was confirmed - the Encore front desk had checked us into someone else's room!  Thank goodness those poor people weren't IN the room when we opened it up.  And thankfully we are honest people and didn't steal their belongings!  \n\nWe immediately grabbed our things and left to tell the front desk that they had checked us into an already occupied room.  The woman at the front desk acted flustered and irritated (not really apologetic though) and offered us an upgrade to a panoramic suit (over the regular suit we had booked).  It was basically the same exact room on a higher floor, which afforded me a better view of the Riviera.  Great. \n\nWe also inquired about using the gym.  Your choices are 15 bucks a day per person, or pay the resort fee for all nights you are staying, which was $67 dollars in our case.  No, thanks, that's TWICE what I pay for my monthly gym membership!  Considering how expensive this hotel is, you would think the guests at the Encore would be allowed to have full use of the facilities offered without paying extra.\n\nI also agree with some other reviewers that the food options at this hotel are a let down.  $3.50 for a small black coffee and 4 bucks for a croissant is not the best way to start your day.  We wound up walking across the street to Fashion Show mall for several meals for better dining options at better prices.  I suppose I can include close proximity to the mall as a plus.\n\nAs a side note, La Reve was completely amazing, and whether or not you stay at the Encore, it is definitely worth seeing!! \n\nOverall, the hotel was nice, and as long as you don't mind spending a lot on your trip, you will have a great stay.  Well, if they don't let strangers into your room, that is!
3;I have been seeing Dr. Johnnie Woodson for years.  He is always very nice and willing to talk to me about my condition at length.  The office has gotten so much better since new management has taken over.\n\nSometimes the wait is a bit longer than I would like but the Doctor is wortht the wait!
4;I'd been wanting a tattoo detailing a concept from my favorite all time book series, The Wheel of Time. I knew Tone's work from a friend of mine and he did an absolutely beautiful job with freehand detailing that is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!!
0;Unfortunately, I had a really terrible experience at this salon. I was excited to try a new place for a great price (with a gel manicure groupon) however when I got to the salon, the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened. I saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke. After I showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying I need to pay again, that my groupon was invalid, and basically accusing me of stealing. I was horrified. She then proceeded to turn to  her coworkers and very obviously talk about me.   It was the most appalling customer service I have ever seen. She went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though I had a legitimate groupon. I would have left immediately had my friend (who also had a groupon) was not already inside. My friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any  problems. She also simply showed her phone to the person, pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace. We were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer.  I am never going back.
3;Went to this location because my normal location was out of something. They were very nice here and held my items no problem.\n\nThis store has a very different vibe than the Summerlin store. It was kind of weird but fun. Everyone here was very nice and helpful.\n\nAs usual, they had a great selection of everything. The produce is always amazing and the meat and seafood counter is to die for. I would definitely go to this location again if I was ever on this side of town.
4;Awesome show! Terry Fator has definetely earn his spot on the Las Vegas Strip as the headliner for the Mirage. Probably one of the best comedy performances I have seen (And I have seen plenty... like Dane Cook live). \n\nFirst of all, I remember when the 'Terry Fator Theatre' was the Danny Gans' theater. They truly did a great job renovating. Terry Fator Theatre is very modern and plush, with great lighting and a stage that would remind you of a game show set. The crowd is warmed up by other comedy performers and  DJs, who plays a danceable mix of pop songs.\n\nFator uses a series of TV-famous plushy, pop-eyed puppet characters, a crew of Muppets knockoffs. But trust me when I say, they are more entertaining than the muppets (they come closer to Avenue Q style puppets).  \n\nFator shows his expertise in ventriloquism within the first five mins of the show, and his animated and expressive characters are a foundation for his true talent: He's a singing impressionist conjuring the distinctive sounds and styles of Garth Brooks, Rod Stewart, Etta James, Louie Armstrong, Axl Rose and even Elvis.\n\nHe is very interactive with the audience, and performs songs that  everyone in the audience should know. Fator is undeniably talented, likeable and professional, and his act at the Mirage shows to be around for a long time.
4;"Had a jarringly friendly counter-woman, which may be standard for Wisconsin.  On a road trip through we only had time for a quick lunch, and I think we made the perfect choice.\n\nThe store is littered with samples. We each ordered sandwiches which came with cornichons (I could take or leave) and a chocolate square (perfect ending). Surprisingly affordable sandwich deal for such a place, but otherwise pretty pricey. \n\nAs I approached the counter I kept finding things I had to buy, cheese squeaks (were great on the road), \""orphans\"" (little cut ends of cheese for $2-4), beer (self explanatory). \n\nWe headed out to the patio with sandwiches and haul in tow, but kept eyeing the grassy patch across the street for a picnic. We weren't sure what the rules were about drinking beer outside of designated restaurant areas, and inquired within. Not only did she say it was fine, the perfect picnic blanket appeared from her hands and we proceeded to have a genuinely great meal in the sun, on the grass, by city hall, watching the protesters and chipmunks scurry around us.\n\nAnyway, this counter woman facilitated a great meal, the bread is universally delicious and sandwich appropriate, though I was partial to the sunflower seed thing used for the PBJ. The cranberry relish on their turkey and the jelly used on PBJ were both similar, chunky, sweet and tasty. Smoked chicken was creamy and the cheese was mild, but could have used a more bitter green on it. I wish I had tried the Salami. Across the board, my only complaint is that I wish the cheeses had been more prominent on the sandwiches, and that I wish they had some kind of grilled cheese/pure cheese sandwich on offer.\n\nI had a local Wisconsin red ale (Quisconsin I think?), a friend had a cider. Both went well."
4;My 20 something son raved about this place! and he doesn't rave about anything. Unique steam punk interior - cool. Hot dogs?not just hot dogs, Old School Stuffed meat - each one made with local ingredients and specific meat combination for each dish. I had the Bahn-Mi - very delicious, served with some of the best fries I've ever had. The staff was into the concept and were excited about explaining the menu. Definitely will go back. We went on the weekend for lunch, not a game day, students hadn't moved in yet, so it wasn't busy and we parked across the street. Given that it is on Regent you have to be creative if you need parking. But very much worth the hassle. Great concept for a restaurant, I think it will be wildly successful when everyone finds out about it.
0;Pleasantly surprised. My room had new, very comfy beds.  No view. Price and location are great.\n\nIf the following did not happen, 3.5 stars.\n\nHowever, service is lacking. Security was rude and ignorant. Manager was rude as well.\n\nBetter places to stay for the same price. \n\nIt is competitive and after that slap in the face I will certainly go elsewhere.
4;I've never had such great customer service in years, until these guys showed up to my home.  They were very professional, courteous and very knowledgeable about their trade.  They put us at ease within minutes even though our entire home was flooded.  I'd recommend this company to anyone in need of their services.
3;Fish is very good and the chips are good if you don't get them to go.\nThe bar area has a good selection of beers on tap (Kronenbourg being my favorite)\nThe staff are friendly and the prices reasonable.\nAs other reviewers have said - the decor is simple, and does remind me of Fish and Chip Shops back in England (I am an ex-pat)\nThe grocery section has a decent selection and you can find some decent imported English foods
0;"Used a groupon prepaid copon for dinner.  Service was very good; after that not so good.  Food was luke warm and the salad was just average.  The Gyro plate was greasey and bland.  For $9.00+ it should have been much better.  I have had Greek food at many places and this one is at the bottom of the list.  I would pass on this one."
1;Waited over 30 minutes for our food... Fish and chips, lamb chops and lamb shank were ok. Scallops had no particular flavor. They were just salty. Accompaniments were less than desirable. Waiter was busy flirting with two ladies sitting at the next table. He stopped by once to check on us when we were nearly done eating. Don't come here if you want service. Trying to get someone to take our credit card so that we can pay and get out of here...
1;There are only two good things about staying at the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. The location and the bed. First of all the super gay employee who checked us in had an attitude when he told us there was a $200 fee to check in and we only had cash. I had no idea of the fee to begin with. Then we were never able to log in with their WiFi connection. Super complicated and it never worked not even offline my phone couldnt connect. I dont know if they have a signal jammer or what. The walk to the room was half a mile. I guess we made the mistake of staying when that loser miley cyrus was booked so the hotel and the parking lot was jam packed with the fall of americas future clogging up the hallways, elevators and parking garage. Spent over $500 for a 3 night stay which was really worth maybe $200. Im Definitely choosing a better place next year.
0;As a NYC girl I have to say this is the first time I ever ordered from here and had delivery from the Surprise AZ Chain, and this will be the last time I ever order. I ordered baked Ziti and it was so dry and looked like they baked a whole pan of it and then take from the pan and Microwave it to heat it, The Ziti noodles were hard I ordered chicken wings as well I did not get any blue cheese dressing & Celery as I asked for and there Garlic Bread was definetely nuked, it is as hard as a Hardball you can not even chew it. what a waste of money. People who say this place is excellent must not be from NY...Sorry to write such a bad review but it is the truth...
1;"When in Vegas, you have to know your way around. I like to think that I'm pretty knowledgeable about the club scene. Well, my girlfriends and I happen to be in Vegas on a Wednesday so we decided to hit up Eclipse. Since discovering Surrender's nighttime pool club, we've been a fan of that scene since. We got a $500 comped table from a host, Kwame, who was awesome btw! He got us checked in and everything ran smoothly. \n\nWelp, that's where it ended. Our waitress, Kelly, was awful. Awful awful lady! She didn't seem to want us there. She over poured our drinks, which I assume to get us to buy a new bottle quicker. My group of girls are all pretty petite, I think you can assume that our tolerance isn't that high. She made us 6 drinks, and the entire bottle was almost finished. You can only assume that those were some stiff drinks! Then when we found out we got charged for 8 water bottles, totaling to over $50 we were super annoyed with the fact that she was annoyed with us. She tells me, \""You said you wanted water.\"" I kindly replied, \""Yes, I did want water, as a mixer for my vodka waters, but I did request 8 bottles.\"" Especially at such a high price! I'm not that frugal but her attitude stunk! She made me feel cheap. Look lady, your 22% gratuity may already be included, but you can at least try to act like you're working for your money! After that, she took our whole bottle service away, just as quickly as we finished our last drop of vodka. RUDE! I've never felt so rushed and embarrassed. And the shitty thing is that her tip for her hour and a half of waiting on us, which was very minimal might I add, was over $130. \n\nEclipse, itself is okay. Big ordinary pool in the center so you can walk around the entire perimeter. DJ set up is at one end of the pool and the bar was opposite of that. It wasn't too visually appealing though. Nothing to rave about. Not visually stunning as you'd like and hope for."
2;Have been here several times and plan to keep going as i have high hopes. I like the atmosphere -nice patio and can't wait for live music. Both service and food a bit uneven. The 50/50 sandwich/.salad is a nice option. Salads are interesting but sometimes dressing seems watery and lacks taste. I rarely eat beef except for here as the carne asada is tasty and burgers are cooked to order. My greatest complaint is that the iced tea always tastes stale.  That is my marker for a good restaurant so i am hoping they figure that out.
0;It's 11:30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again
3;Minus one star for the slowness of service and the room in general. I get that things need to be cooked to order, but some attentiveness in between or acknowledgment that it had taken over 30 minutes for us to get from the first course to the next one would have been nice. \n\nAlso, I felt like I was sitting in the lap of one of the people in the table next to me. We basically had to maneuver our table in order to go to the bahtroom and I'm a small person -- I cannot imagine what someone of normal height would have to do. It's also not as if we were a surprise guest -- I made my reservations well in advance. \n\nThanks to the food, both of these issues were very much overshadowed.  \n\nOur meals began with their squash soup shooter and bread amuse bouche. Both were great. Then came the bread platter. Amazing. Between my boyfriend and I we tried all of them, our favorites being the bacon one (bacon!!!) and the lemon/rosemary one. \n\nFor my first course I had their seared foie dish. It was superb. Su-perb. The boy got the fruit de mer bowl and all in all it was good but not impressive since we hail from the land of seafood. The highlight of it though was the tuna in the middle. It melted in your mouth.\n\nMy main course was the duck. That was also great. Well seasoned and the confit of some of the leftovers that they gave me was also very good. My boyfriend's rabbit was also very well done. He had never had rabbit before and enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nBy the time dessert arrived, we were both sufficiently stuffed. I ordered the chocolate souffle and it was everything I had hoped for. Rich. Creamy in the middle. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Sphere which was not only rich and tasty but also really cool to watch as they poured the sauce over it.\n\nI really like the petit fours at the end but they seemed a bit overkill given how rich everything else was. The mini jewelry box with truffles was also a nice added touch.
2;Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \n\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE
4;I was blown away by La Reve -- Steve Winn's version of Cirque du Soleil. It was nothing short of spectacular! The water elements were truly amazing. I couldn't believe the acrobatics, the heights, the dancing, the antics. I was also surprised by the depth of emotion I felt too. It was so abstract, yet so emo. \n\nI do wonder about the guy with the man boobs though... can anyone enlighten me? Still contemplating that one.
3;Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.
0;"I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their \""decorations\"" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  \n\nSo I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  \n\nI ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.\n\nMy overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's."
4;I would not trust anyone but Connie to watch my dog.  The pictures she has posted of her clients are so cute and adorable.   She is so flexible and when she has watched my dog in the past, I would always get a text message about how she was doing.  Great place highly recommend.
2;"I really want to like this 131, yet at the same time why should I care? The last couple of times I've been my experience has been subpar. Plus, the interior just has an odd feel...maybe it's me. The location is great, but the setup seems odd and the place has never been busy when I've gone. Anyway...\n\nWhen this place is on, it's pretty damn solid. I recommend sitting outside or at the cocktail tables in the bar. I'm no southern boy and, therefore, not a cornbread fan, but this place does something unreal with it. I order it every time. Drizzle the honey on it and....mmmmm. Try the awesome roast beef sandwich (I never recommend roti de beouf, but here I make an exception). The steak salad and the ahi tuna salad are both on-point; I'm a sucker for noodles, mango, avocado...etc. These are entree size portions, not your run-of-the-mill wimpy salad with a slab o' meat on it.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, however, I just haven't been impressed the last couple visits. A subpar veggie burger and a stale roll on my roast beef sandwich...seriously hard as a rock. Service was slow and didn't seem genuine, which doesn't make sense when the place is nearly empty. I don't know why this location struggles so. Will someone enlighten me? It never looks busy when I walk by either.\n\nAll that said, I recommend the Cornelius or Ballantyne locations over this one, which is too bad considering this one definitely has the best location."
0;"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....\n\nLast year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  \""You can't do that.\""  \""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\"" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \""The owners don't allow it.\""  \""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\""  \""No.  You'll have to put it away.\""\n\nNow.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  \n\nA couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    \n\nI'd kind of like the \""Restaurant Impossible\"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
0;1. The place was filthy! the window we sat at had algae and/or mold over the entire surface. The ceiling had water damage and had been spottily fixed. (Imagine what you can not see.) \n2. From the time we ordered the soup and salad portion took 40 minutes. Dinner was far over 60 minutes. \n3. We had to get up and find someone to get our drinks refilled for just water and tea. 4. The appetizer orders were half wrong. \n5. One dinner order was wrong. No manager came to talk to us or apologize for a thing. \n6. Potatoes came without sour cream..others came without butter. (which never came)\n7. Staff was not at all friendly or nice. They kept saying they were extremely busy but the dining room had only two tables with customers.....and there were more than 5 servers with at least two boys for busing, so I have no idea what they do when actually busy. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice marina atmosphere try Red Fin Blues Instead. SKIP THIS PLACE COMPLETELY!
1;Well we had a company function here today. Had fun bowling, then we wanted to get food. Went to the restaurant, only to be disappointed. Cajun fish is not Cajun, only blackened, not spicy at all. For those who can not have spicy food, do not order the Sloppy Joe, the menu says nothing but it is spicy. Did take time for the waiter to tell the manager of the problem, making it seem that I ate the sloppy joe. Not true, the sandwich comes with the bun off the sloppy joe with a pile diced spicy jalapeno on top. Took over 10 minutes for the replacement dish to come out by that time my co-workers were done with their food, so had to get it to go. \n\nNeedless to say that we will not go there to eat. Bowling yes and it's free for locals the first hour. Great service while bowling. They just need to have better staff and a menu that is correct to show what they do feed you.
0;I've been a loyal Home Depot customer for years, and this is by far the worst one I've been to in the country. I just bought a home in the area and have been to this particular location dozens of times over the last 10 months. The staff is in not knowledgable, helpful, or responsive. It's extremely disappointing, to say the least.
2;We went here on a Saturday night for my sister's bachlorette party - we were a group of 6.  It was busy but not super crowded - there was still room at the bar, although most of the tables were taken.\n\nOur service was extremely slow - 20 mins to get our first drink and another 15 to get some food (which the bride-to-be desparately needed if we were going to continue our night!)  I mentioned this to our waiter and he said he was just super busy.  We noticed that he was going around to all his tables to take orders, and then would go back to the kitchen instead of putting a few orders in at a time.\n\nLuckily, the manager checked in on us and I politely noted the slow service and things turned around quickly.  I can forgive slow service (everyone has their off days) if mgmt is responsiveness to their patron's concerns.  \n\nWe enjoyed it a lot, largely in part to the change in the service.  We had the s'mores platter - cute idea and plenty for 6 girls to share - as well as a bottle of Prosecco and a couple round of shots.  Our total was $165 for 6 girls for 4 round of drinks and our food which I thought was reasonable for a setting like that. \n\nGreat lounge atmosphere, and fun, unique idea.
0;"When we arrived at 6pm for dinner, the restaurant was busy but not full.  We were seated fairly quickly.  Then ignored for 30 (yes thirty) minutes, no kidding here.  We finally got bread and water from the single bus person in the entire place after about 10 minutes.  I asked one of the waitresses for help, after she took an order from a table that came in well after us.  She said she didn't know where our waitress was.  It appeared there were only two, and the one who sat us was our waitress.  The one who sat us was busy taking the order of a large table that also came in after us.  So once again, we asked the \""not our\"" waitress who was annoyed I was asking her again and still didn't even attempt to get us any service.  The ONLY reason we waited as long as we did was my father wanted to take us to this place.  So finally, at 6:30 we left and went to Zur Kate, another German restaurant in the same parking lot.  Which was good all the way around, live accordion music was fun. Service with a smile instead of annoyance.  The food was pretty good and the prices were much better as well.  But hey - if you like water and bread (ok, the bread was good) then head on down to Bavarian point."
3;"Forget Filiberto's. Forget Riva's. Forget Super Burrito and the countless other fast food Mexican places in the valley. So what if their fluorescent overhead lighting and cheap plastic booths give you high school cafeteria flashbacks? If you want atmosphere and more of that family feel, head to Abuelo's or Serrano's nearby. \n\nIf you're looking for a perfect breakfast burrito for under $4, Los Favs is the only place that delivers. The tortillas are always fresh, hot, slightly chewy, and ridiculously good. Combine that with fluffy eggs, soft potatoes, spicy chorizo (or ham, bacon, sausage, machaca or beans), and a handful of melted mexican blend; what do you get? A forearm-sized, artery-clogging gift from the gods that's just as good after a night of drinking as it is stone cold sober. Top if off with their tangy green sauce, and you'll be as addicted as I am. My only complaint is that they're not open 24/7 so that I can get my burro fix any time of the day! \n\nHere's a tip: call in your order early on a Saturday or Sunday morning for a cheap, delicious breakfast that'll fuel you up for the long day of beer and football ahead. Cheers!"
3;The Piemaker boasts that it's sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry. \nDouble pastry?!?!?!\nToo perfect.
2;You can't go wrong with a Club Lulu w/ cheese - that's been at five stars in my book since I first discovered Jimmy Johns in college (Columbia, MO).\n\nThis review is specific to the experience I had at this Las Vegas location.\n\nI called for delivery, but was shot down by a rude female who said my location was out of their one-mile radius delivery range even though the borderline intersection she mentioned was outside the apartment I was visiting. Despite trying to explain this to her, she would not back down and so I didn't place an order.\n\nGoing over the options of what to do (e.g. walk or drive), I decided to call back one last time. As I hoped, a different worker answered the phone. Although he did mention that my intersection was the furthest they go for delivery, he heard me out and placed my order. It's because of that fine human being that I got my Club Lulu w/ cheese delivered.
3;First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back. \n\nI hope it is............
4;We just moved to the neighborhood and we were looking for that new local spot, we were nervous after reading the reviews about slow or bad service.  My wife and I have been several times just for drinks as well as we have brought the whole family for lunch and dinner.  We have not had a bad experience yet!  My guess is some of these reviews may have been when they first opened and were not quite the fine oiled machine of today.  Good food and drink menu with reasonable pricing and specials.  Check this place out!
3;"I've been obsessed with the Bread Basket granola for years now... it's soft and sweet and salty all at once and goes perfect with yogurt and fruit for breakfast!  I usually purchase it at Sunflower (which is now Sprouts), but I decided to pop my head in their actual store the other day to see what other tasty treats they have...\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that a tiny little storefront had such a variety of options to choose from (including my fave granola).  I could have literally purchased one of everything but I took it easy as I know I'll be back.  I went for a few muffins (raspberry and apple cinnamon) and of course some of the original granola that I so love.  It was hard to say no to the cookies and fresh made breads, etc... and I learned that they offer a full lunch menu full of salads, sandwiches, and soups too.\n\nService (from a fellow named Reuf) couldn't have been more friendly.  I'll definitely be back soon and can safely say that \""Yay! I'm a fan.\"""
1;"I'm not usually one to pay double to have my oil done in fifteen minutes, but a couple times, like before a road trip i would have no choice.\n\none time everything was just fine, everyone was pleasant. but i hate the nonsense of them pulling you out to your car, lifting your hood and giving the rehearsed, ten times a day spiel about needing a new air filter, windshield wipers, windshield fluid..blah blah blah. one time in the spiel i totally thought the guy said that my \""cabin pressure\"" was off. when i interrupted to ask \""did you just say cabin pressure?\"" he was so taken off guard that i was listening to everyone word, he didn't know what to say.\nanyway, not a fan of this location"
0;The Bootlegger RUINED my wedding! About 2 months ago, I inquired about the copa room for a party of 100 people. Every time I called, the event manager was not in and I was told to call back later. After a month of trying to call, one of the managers gave me the email address to contact Denise the events manager. She was out of town, so I spoke with Ron. Ron said come in any time and someone will show me the room. My mother-in-law and I went there, FELL IN LOVE with the room, and spoke to 3 people who said it was a Wednesday and its slow and no reservations have been made for 12-12-12. I finally got an email back from Denise a week later, and she told me the date is open, people have inquired, but no one put down a deposit. She also sent me a contract which stated the prices on the web site. When I went to call her, she was at a wedding show, and would not be in until monday. So Danny showed me the room again, and took my $1,000 deposit. After a few more emails trying to contact her to set up a meeting so I could pay in full the rest of the package, she emailed me back saying she would only rent the room to me if I paid $150 a person which would come out to $15,000! (because of the 12-12-12 date). I called her and basically got the reason why : Another couple who inquired AFTER I put down the deposit was willing to spend $150 a person. So I was BACK BURNER because my package was just a basic package stated on the website and they could make more off of someone else. WOW.....they don't honor their deposits! And they don't care if you have family that got invitations flying in from all over the country..... or that you hired a celebrity entertainer that doesn't return deposits. \n\nDenise did say that she would return my deposit in check form, but I paid cash so I called Danny and he pressed to give me cash back.\n\nUnfortunately,  they lost more than my business over this. A lot of people who were coming most likely would have rented the venue for business on a monthly basis. Or that they could use my celebrity entertainer as a marketing tactic. I will warn them NEVER to book the copa room because of this terrible experience. And the grooms family who have been customers since the 80's will never eat there again.
2;"It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \""OK.\"""
0;This place is really bad.  Not sure how you can have such bad service when its so empty but they pulled it off.\n\nThe food made me sick.  I am sure there are no stray dogs or cats in the area because the pork I had tasted like something totally different\n\nWill not be back here.  What a waste of a meal
3;It's been almost 2 years since I've been here. the fact that they're still open is a good sign. I tried the to slice in a drink combo again today.\n\nThe crust is amazing, thin and crispy yet chewy at the same time.The butter garlic sauce on the back of the crust was excellent. The cheese was fresh the sauce was light but good, I would recommend extra sauce. Service was good, the owner asked how everything was and made some suggestions. Too bad I am outside their delivery area.
1;Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average.  There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland.  I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food.  Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back.
3;Went to Sears the other day. My fridge broke. So I was due for a new one ASAP. As I found the appliance section, a gentleman by the name of Marcus greeted me and asked if I needed help with anything. I handed him over the paper I had printed out from a fridge I found online on their website. He brought me over to that fridge and it ended up being way smaller than I was hoping for. No wonder it was so cheap... \n\nHe than asked what kind of fridge I was looking for and if I lived in a condo or home. He than suggested the fridge that was next to the little one that this was the normal/standard size fridge. It was $100 more but it was what I needed. I called my mom to let her know I found a Kenmore fridge and she told me kenmore motors are known to be loud when they're running so I should check that out. Marcus without hesitation turned on the fridge for me and even let me know that the fridge next to the Kenmore I decided to pick, the motor was loud and his previous customers returned it. I appreciate the honesty. After that was done we proceeded to ring up. When ringing up he waived the $9.99 8a-12pm delivery fee. Wish he could've waived the $15 haul-away fee too! Oh well. Everything was quick and easy, but I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted so, that helped.
4;I just wanted to complement Ali Murray, the Catering Sales Manager at the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas.  I had been communicating with Ali regarding possibly having an upcoming event at the resort.  She was extremely timely, helpful, and detailed in her email responses.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was able to pre-arrange a meeting in person to discuss details, and she was even waiting in the lobby when we arrived. She gave us an outstanding and thorough tour of the Mandarin Oriental, which by the way is gorgeous!  Ali also followed up upon our return to see if there was any additional assistance she could provide.  \n\nAs far as the resort itself goes, the Mandarin Oriental is sophisticated and provides a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, among the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, without being far removed.  it is definitely the best of both worlds.  \n\nAlthough, we ultimately decided to go in a different direction, we will definitely consider this resort for future events.  Hopefully, Ali will still be there!  She is sensational, a joy to meet, and represents the best of the Mandarin Oriental.  I would HIGHLY recommend working with her.
0;Their menu looked like a great place to go to... Especially when looking for a late night place to eat. However, I was HIGHLY disappointed. I ordered chicken tenders and fries and my boyfriend ordered mild wings. It honestly tasted like it was just frozen store bought food. It was also quite expensive (around 28$) for the value and quality of food that was given. I'm sure it's a fun place to have a couple of drinks but I will not be returning to eat here anytime soon.
1;I was hoping for a spectacular neighborhood diner but it's rather ordinary as far as food, menu, and atmosphere.  I had a full breakfast and everything was just ok, service was just ok, and I don't think they've updated the furniture for decades.  Must be the location that explains their success, and those retired folks sitting up at the counter.
3;I dined here on Monday 04/29. I ordered the Korean steak tacos, they were ok but nothing special. The vanilla bean cheesecake however was good. The waitress young lady long blond hair, was very good and attentive.
0;I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!! \nJust not this location -_____-\nI feel horrible giving this place a one star but even Steve Ells (Chipotle GOD) would be appalled to see the long, stagnant lines in this place!! I mean 30 minutes to actually get your order in and another 10 minutes as you go down the array chipotle goodness... 40 grueling minutes just get your food! All due to inexperienced, always flustered, untrained staff... BYE FELICIA. \n\n*take note I usually go here around 230pm and 8pm... Not really peak times for it to be crowded. \n\nIt's like this location messes with my emotions , I get so pissed waiting almost an hour for my chipotle bowl ... But once I take a bite out of that chicken... I fall in love with chipotle all over again.... Ugh! Management please do something about how your staff is trained !\n\nAnd PLEASE teach your staff to change their gloves,,, wiping your nose and touching food is only okay if it's your own not for customers ......
2;I love me some asian markets! Why? Because I am half Asian Duh! You get over the smell after a couple years practically growing up going to them your whole life.  What I love about this place is the bakery selection. I still did not see my ensymada cakes with ube or macapuno in them but they had red bean bread(SOLD!) and different flavored mochi etc etc etc. The produce looked kinda weird but the Philippine champagne mangoes looked on point almost bought a case but I cannot eat a whole box to myself. The prices are somewhat steep compared to Lee Lees so i think i will have to stick with lee lees since they give you 10% off every day.\n\nI am all about a good deal and lee lees has those.
0;Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.
2;"really nice space. a little too dark but i guess that bodes well for people looking to hook up because after a few drinks everyone starts to look good in this place. my friend and i made this our first stop to begin our adventure for the night. drinks were pricey but i always expect that at most places. didn't have to wait very long for drinks. i loved that the ladies room had \""sexy bitch\"" on the door. an obvious photo op. the music started out great when we walked in and then started getting a bit too house for us. so that was our cue to leave. i'd come back."
2;"I came here with my team of staff for a staff meeting because we prefer going and supporting local business than chains like Starbucks. And if we are meeting, why not take the opportunity to treat our staff at good quality local coffee shop too, just makes perfect sense to us.\n\nWhen the 4 of us arrived, the general indoor seating area had a few large tables (large enough for 4 people) that were taken by single persons. So we resorted to having our meeting in the \""vault\"" which has an open table large enough for us. This was our first time here and did not know whether the \""vault\"" area was a quiet area or not, but we tried to discuss work without being overly loud. An hour later, a fellow patron leaving the room told us that it was the \""quiet room\"" and that we should not be in there. \n\nNot seeing a single \""quiet\"" sign around, I decided to confirm with Xtreme Bean staff and their response was that they don't know why people have the impression that it is a quiet room. It is just another room, nothing special about it.\n\nSo I want to make sure my fellow patron knows, if you want to have a super quiet space to work at, maybe staying at home is a better option, or go to the library. Please don't tell fellow customers to leave, especially those who could not gain access to the large tables, because those were taken by other solo customers who love to spread out their belongings on a table large enough for a group of four.\n\nWe all love to support local businesses, so please make sure you know what the \""rules\"" actually are before confronting other customers about your need for \""quietness.\"" If that is so important to you, please stay home.\n\nSorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review. But I just want other customers to know about my overall experience here was a good one. \n\nThe staff was helpful and the drinks were decent, but us customers could do better to help support the business by being a little more considerate and not take up more space than we need to. \n\nIf you take up a table large enough for four and others had no choice but leave because of that, you are indirectly taking the business away from the coffee shop. With more people there, they will sell more drinks and food. Of course, unless you plan to purchase enough food and drinks to cover the difference between one customer and four customers. I am just talking from a business owner's point of view, since I run a small business too.\n\nNote to staff of Xtreme Beans, please let me know if I am wrong about the \""quiet room\"" since I last talked with you. I will be happy to take my staff somewhere else if the large tables were taken by single users and we could not use the customer designated \""quiet room.\"" \n\nWe are definitely going to give Xtreme Bean Coffee another try though."
3;I am a huge fan of Re Salon & Med Spa! \n\nEveryone that works at the salon is amazing - all the special attention you receive definitely makes for a great experience. I have been going to the salon for 6 months now and have had multiple visits - everything from cut & color to mani/pedi. \n\nIf you are looking for someone who is magic with color & cut you have to see Bethany - she is definitely one of the best!
2;"One of the older station casinos I enjoy going to. It's close to my house which makes it a sought after place for gambling, eating or bowling. Parking never seems to be an issue since there are lots around the entire casino and a decent sized parking garage.\n\nThe eateries are nothing spectacular in my opinion. I have tried a few places but never returned with all of the other options in the area. I will find myself having a small bite in the \"" cafeteria \"" are with fast food options for a quick or to go meal.\n\nI mainly come here to play the slot or bingo from time to time. I like the layout of the slot machines and the fact that they are not right on top of one another. Being so close to where I live I will come back from time to time but I usually drive a little further to GVR for my local place to play."
1;"Ohhh I wanted to like it! We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \""disgusting\"". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \""disgusting\"" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \""natural\"" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger."
1;"Seriously had to meet the driver at Brillobox, because it was the closest he \""was allowed\"" to get to Larimer/East Liberty. Cried insurance wolf. Honestly, is it still the 80's? (Besides 80's night at the 'Box! Let's be serious here!) Are we not progressive, forward-thinking individuals? East Liberty is TOO SCARY for you? Hey man, I'm hurt. We're all hurt over here. And since we know what it feels like to be hurt, we wouldn't want to hurt you, man. Cause it sucks to be hurt. \n\nWorld change starts with our attitudes."
0;If you're vegetarian this place is not for you.   The food sucks.  I can make better veg byrani and paneer tikka masala at home.   I gave one star for naan roti.  Least they got that correct. I would not come here again.   I was expecting good food similar to Shalimar in northern California.
4;This is one of the best if not the best coffee haven in Charlotte. The atmosphere is terrific the product is fabulous the people are awesome and now I have a great rewards program on top of everything else
2;We were staying at the Venetian and came downstairs to Bouchon for breakfast at 11:00 since it's convenient. Only to our disappointment, breakfast is over at 10:30. BOO! This is Vegas people! 11:00 is early for us, especially from partying the night before... Sigh...\n\nThey showed us their lunch menu and there were very limited items: 3 desserts, salads, and sandwiches. I got the chicken salad and my boyfriend got some sandwich with a crazy name. \n\nHis sandwich was okay, but my salad wasn't great. It tasted dirty and the bread was stale. \n\n3 stars because the service was really good, my boyfriend liked his sandwich, the interior is nice, and you get a view of the pool. I guess seeing the pool could be a pro or a con. Luckily no gross looking people were outside waddling around while we were eating. :) lol So mean..I know...
2;"It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \n\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \""sweetie/honey\"" southern hospitality and down home appeal. \n\nIt's a solid spot for a low budget meal.  You will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation."
2;"After living in Vegas for over 8 years now I've eaten quite a few burgers all over town, but since starting this blog I've had to look at many of them in a whole new light. One burger I've eaten many times is the one at All-American Bar & Grille at the Rio because I used to work down the street. I remembered it being decent, but how does it hold up now that I'm being completely subjective?\n\nThe front seating area of All-American is a fairly clean, loud area with a big bar and lots of TV's, open directly into the equally loud and slightly more hideous casino floor. It's great for people watching as the Rio doesn't always attract the most savory folks. It was especially great the day I went for my burger, as NASCAR was in town. Need I say more? The back seating area of the restaurant is a bit 'nicer'; if you're coming here for a steak you might want to eat back there.\n\nBoth the lunch and dinner menus are fairly similar, featuring a wide variety of steaks and pretty much every generic thing offered in all bars across the country. The choice of the day for me was the All-American Classic Burger which I got with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and the standard lettuce, tomato and onions. What gets served to you is a decent presentation, but I was a bit disappointed by the waffle fries that I immediately saw on my plate as I'm typically not a fan and I wasn't given a choice for anything else. The meat had decent flavor, but was way overcooked from the medium-rare I had ordered, while my friend's medium was cooked how I would have liked. Did they mix up our orders or can they just not cook to order properly? The bun had good flavor, but was a bit too thick and way too dry. The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms had peppery good flavor, and the Swiss was melted and tasted good. And while I used maybe  of the lettuce they provided me, all of the veggies were fresh and good as well.\n\nMy waffle fries as I mentioned were quite disappointing; kind of stale, not very hot and pretty generic. For years coming to All-American I remembered getting a basket of random fries; some waffle, curly, skinny, and fat. That would have been more welcome as I liked the variety, even if it seemed like you were always eating from a mixed bottom of the barrel.\n\nOverall the burger was good, but nothing out of this world. $12.99 is probably about right for a casino location such as this, but I think it's a little steep for what it is. Plus the service has typically been less than stellar every time I've been there. I think on this particular trip our waitress took our food order and drink order at the same time. Talk about being prompt. There probably aren't too many other choices off the strip by the Rio, but if you're at the property and want a burger you can't go wrong, just don't go out of your way to come here."
3;Took my mom here for her birthday last week and we had a fantastic time. ( the added fun of seeing her sitting on a saddle and being YEE-HAWED! By a room of patrons didn't hurt!)    But the food was very nice. Mom had the prime rib and swears it's the best she's ever eaten. I had the Tbone and was very pleased. The thing that puts the roadhouse at the top of my list however, was the perfect spicy bloody Mary from the bar. Soooo good.     Give them a try.... Try not to slip on the peanut shells.
2;No free refills on drinks\n\nGreat service ... that was a 5 star rating\n\nToo expensive for what it was. Priced like a Baton Rouge or the keg. \n\nI probably won't go back\n\nThe desserts looked great though
4;Phenomenal service. Fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch! I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to eat healthy.
0;We have brought our jeep to be serviced here for the past 6 years. Last week we brought it in for a simple oil leak. They call back notifying us that the computer fried. When we went to pay our bill for the oil leak, they had tacked on about a thousand dollars for the computer they broke and tried to charge us. We were very upset and was unable to talk to a manager till they next day who claims that they would give us a discount rate but wouldn't pay for the computer that they broke!
0;Do NOT eat here! Customer service sucks! We were waiting for almost an hour and we haven't gotten our food so we left! Run far away from this restaurant!
2;Had chicken tacos for lunch.  It's fast and inexpensive.
0;I had him fix the front of my house and he did a decent job. Then I gave the assignment to do my entire backyard. To my utter disappointment it's 80% clover. He gave an absolute assurance that this will not happen. Don't waste your money get a real professional company.
2;What to say what to say...\nhmmm\nfood is consistent & classic - nothing really 'new' or trendy on the menu - but thats what durants is known for, classic steak.\nwe live downtown so have gone many many times (in fact my grandmother has stories about going since they first opened...)\nanyways - its good, its kinda salty, and if youre old & white they will probably kiss your ass, sorry had to say it!\nId rather hit City Hall or J&G, but i do LOVE their shrimp cocktail!
2;Another neighborhood Thai place NOT in Chinatown area.  Love when we can save time and not have to drive all the way to Chinatown.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were quickly greeted by the server and seated, and I have to admit that I was quite impressed by the well done decor.  That aside, I would have to say that I was pretty satisfied with the food experience.\n\nHad to order some our usual fav's (Being that it was our first time here, we decided to play it safe and order 2 out of 4 level spicy just in case we didn't want our bootays kicked too badly):\n1.  Papaya Salad - We couldn't taste the spiciness at all.  However, I still enjoyed the tangy and sweet refreshing and crunchy papaya shreds.  Perfect for summer.\n2.  Tom Yum Gong - This soup I felt was way too sweet and also lacked any spiciness.  Someone was a little heavy handed with the sugar ladle, but the bf seemed to slurp his up happily.\n3.  Pad Kra Pow - We ordered this dish in the chopped beef form and it actually had some spicy kick.  Maybe they forgot to add the spice in the other two dishes?  *shrug.  Either way, this dish was my fav of the night.  Spicy, minty and flavorful.  =)\n\nConclusion 08.02.2010:  I've certainly have had better Thai food at other places, but this place is very a-ok in my book.\n\nConclusion 08.03.2010:  Yup!  I went 2 days in a row, but it did help me solidify my conclusion that the food here is definitely on the wayyyy sweeter side.  Still just a-ok and prefer other Thai places over this one.  Sucked in by the nice owner and the wonderful zen decor!
3;"Niiiiiiice! \n\nDid not know the Golden Nugget had been renovated! I heard they had a new pool, but did not know the whole place had had a face lift. It certainly has and man, it is looking nice. It is definitely a welcome change from the other casinos on Fremont Street.\n\nInside there are nice colors, new carpets. There is a mellow orange/yellow/bronze theme going on. Nice chandeliers hanging from the ceilings, looking kind of art-deco-ish. Smokey smell is kept to a minimum as well! They probably put in a new air system.\n\nMy relatives had three rooms here. One in the Carson Tower and two in the Gold Tower. Oh dayum, their rooms in the Gold Towers were great! All new furniture, flat screen TVs, nice beds. I can't comment on their room service or anything, but the rooms - definitely looking good! The room in the Carson Tower was much smaller, but still nice.\n\nI did not get to enjoy the pool, but from looking at it, it seemed a bit small to me. However, the water slide looks fun! And of course they have the aquarium with the sharks in it right next to the pool. Oh and word to the wise my relatives said there is a pool called the \""Hideaway\"" which has less children and is 16+. \n\nI just really enjoyed my time in here over the weekend meeting my relatives."
3;Everything is great except for service.\nSeeeeeems like you will get ignored more and more the longer you stay for AYCE.\nI don't know if this is a tradition at AYCE sushi places, but this time it seemed quite obvious that they no longer wanted to take our orders.\nEverything tastes very good, when you get it though.
2;Food was very good. Service was subpar. The bartender seems to ignored us and was very curt and distracted.
3;I found Snick's first on Yelp looking through a list of dives near Theatre 7, and through word of mouth (a friend who had been there before).  Snick's, being just two spaces down from Theatre 7 was the ideal candidate for drinks after an event held in the lot this past First Friday/Pollygrind kick-off party event.\n\nThe bartender (the shorter, gray haired fella) was incredibly friendly, and cracked jokes all night with everybody he talked to it seemed.  The drinks, even the more quality beers, were relatively cheap.  I'm told that on Saturday nights there is an evening happy hour that is awesome, but we didn't make it out there the following day.\n\nThe jukebox is great!  The selection is good, but it really shines with the search feature.  I've searched many a juke in my day, and this one turned out some of the most obscure tunes I could think of.
1;Omikase was not worth the price. Service wasn't great. The server told us no sharing, which was a big turn-off. Would not recommend.
1;This restaurant is located in The Sanctuary, a posh mountainside spa and resort. Prices for midday lunch at the bar were reasonable, but our waiter was terribly slow and unattentive w/ no good excuse. Other patrons noticed and he started comping things, but unevenly. We ate at the bar - the caesar salad and sandwich (which they did graciously split for us) were both, fine, but nothing to write home about.  It had a cool little vibe I guess and in a really pretty hotel.
0;Skaters beware,  this is a communist park ran by racist people who don't like skaters.  This place had ridiculous rules that constantly change.  Be very careful, if someone there doesn't like you ,  they will kick you out.   Don't waste your time or money here...   sucks sucks sucks sucks.  Including the staff!
1;I wanted to love this place so much. It's around the corner from my place and was super excited to hear of its opening. Went in today right at 5. It was hard to miss all of the employees in the restaurant,  and equally hard to miss how messy the salsa bar and drink station were. Surely one of the employees could wipe the counters?  The best thing I ordered was a side of beans. Beans. My turkey mole taco was ok. But the pastor taco had no flavor. Both tacos needed salt. I'm so sad that the food wasn't better. Not sure if I will try again.
1;Close to my house so I checked it out again. Maybe 3 ppl plus a very in attentive bar tender (dare I call him that). More interested in goofing on his iPad than trying to provide any kind of service. I quickly dropped $45, practically had to beg to get a beer. I'll pay for the beer, just actually pay attention.\n\nProlly try it in a few months but I doubt anything will change. Hasn't in over a year. No wonder it's empty at 1am
3;"While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!"
2;I've been to Chop Shop a few times now, and while I appreciate a new, relatively inexpensive healthy place to grab a bite to eat, I'm just not super impressed. \n\nThe first time I went I wasn't very hungry and was hoping for a yummy juice or smoothie. I do like how they offer cold pressed juices and am looking forward to trying one someday. I picked a fruity smoothie I believe called the Beach Burn. It was alright, but absolutely not worth $6.\n\nOn my next visit I popped in for a quick bite before work. They delivered my girl friend's sandwich significantly before mine even though I ordered first, which was annoying but not the end of the world. I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich and my friend had the club. Both were good, just nothing to write home about in my opinion. \n\nI'll probably give Chop Shop one last try to find something I really like because as I mentioned it's not too pricey and within walking distance of my work.
0;I ordered the ramen bowl and the broth was completely inedible. It tasted like water and oil. They didn't have any additional condiments like soy sauce or salt and pepper on the table. It took another 15 minutes to flag someone down to get some soy sauce. \n\nFor $12 bucks it was a total rip off. Not only was it inauthentic but it was not even palatable without copious amounts of condiments. \n\nIf you're looking for good and cheaper noodles, go to Umami or Ha Long Bay instead.
4;Atmosphere is lovely, and most of the time the staff is awesome. If you like strong coffee, be sure to specify so they make it strong! :)\n\nPrices are good. Best hummus I've had in a long time.\n\nChocolate chip cookie was delicious,.\n\nToxic shake is to die for! Amazing.
0;"I was not impressed with this Thai restaurant. The ambience was missing, and the service was severely lacking. My friend and I decided to give it a try after hearing many good reviews, and it was a mistake. We came there at lunch time and had to wait to get seated. The place was extremely small and dirty. There were many pieces of food thrown about on the floor and the odor was not very pleasant. Eventually, when we got seated, the waitress was rude; she threw the menus down on the table and did not provide any pleasantries. \n\nOur food was average at best. The spice levels were completely wrong. I like my Thai soups at 3 at most, and it came out at 6. Upon asking the server to amend this mistake, we were met with attitude and frowns, even though I was very polite about my request. The food was okay, but I didn't feel that it was fresh tasting. In fact, the rice was rather dry and traditional Thai drinks were tasteless.\n\nI didn't really like anything about this place. Maybe, I'll give it another try at its other location, but I am never coming back to this one."
0;Pros\n-tram in city ctr that goes to bellagio/vdara\n-comfortable bed/pillows\n-2 separate closets\n\nCons\n-not efficient\n-service slow starting from checking in to checking out\n-no face/hand towels.only 4 body towels total\n-bathroom door is a sliding dr cheap handle came off.\n-technology too high tech made it confusing\n-tv didnt worth took 2hrs then called front desk (they dont answer their phones.slow service...it was a tues night)\n-tv repair man came turns out hdmi cable was loose so he had to unplug and plug it back it. plus remote batteries die so he had to replaced that.That's why the remote/tv didnt work\n-cafe vettruo slow.dont order alcohol cuz its water down\n-complimentary late check out at 1pm have to call front desk on the day of only (not day before) and that's if you get a hold of them\n-casino floor dark and small.mostly new games.even the $0.01 slots are minimum $0.40 plays.Missed the old goldfish machine.they have a new ones only\n-ticket/bill breaker machine doesnt even work.didnt accept cash.wtf???\n\nOverall got more cons than pros.wasnt happy with my stay here.lucky it was for business trip so it was free for me.
0;Avoid! Now I know why all of the positive reviews said great late night place. You need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food. We were 0 for 4 on dinners. BBQ chicken pizza crust was burned and lacked flavor. The pulled pork was dried out, tough and lacked taste. Buffalo Mac n cheese was too thick tasted like they just dumped Frank's Red Hot Sauce in. Lastly, the jerk chicken was too jerky. Waitress took our order and didn't check on us or offer to get more drinks.
3;Came here with an Australian friend I ran into, we wanted to do the whole American diner thing, and boy was it fun.\n\nVery warm welcome for us, as a Brit & an Aussie we instantly hit it off with the staff and had a laugh.\n\nFood was superb, I LOVED the chilli cheese fries, very hard to find over here and actually enjoy. Had the Chicken Philly cheese steak and it was great, really well prepared and quickly delivered. Prices were fantastic and service efficient and friendly. I'd love to come again for lunch.
3;I found nothing wrong. Nice staff. Food was fine. No complients here :) mananger was super cool.!
3;Pretty good and cozy Place for casual dinning.... Steak and lobster bisque soup were really great!!!
3;Good service, tasty food. However, I have never been to Tibet so I can't compare it to the authentic one.

0;"I have visited this store several times beause I want to look cute while pregnant. I was excited to see they carried maternity versions of brands I normally wear, but buyer beware! I bought a pair of Sanctuary Pants (over $100) and the first time I washed them the buttons fell off! I washed them on cold, gentle cycle, inside out (our washer is the kind without an agitator) and didn't even dry them. I have several pairs of Sanctuary pants that are not maternity and worn them for years without issue. Everything I have purchased were top dollar desinger brands and they don't wear like their non maternity counterparts. And watch out for the \""FREE\"" Parenting Magazine they want to sign you up for. We got charged $20 for it on the credit card we used for one of our purchases without being notified. Cute clothes but really check them out before you buy and don't expect anything to last through your pregnancy."
3;"I think Ishi is an unnoticed gem in the Charlotte sushi scene; I go there a lot and the food is always of consistent quality and they have a BIG variety of rolls. They're also one of the few restaurant in Charlotte that serves simple but quality hibachi entrees at fair prices, and fast!\n\nI have to rave about their sushi because Ishi does not come off as a fancy, high-end sushi bar, but their rolls are fantastic! They must have a good chef because the special rolls are well put together and delicious, plus they are always tightly packed with perfectly cooked rice. Cold ingredients are cold and fried rolls have just the right amount of tempura. ALSO the presentation is great, the plates are always beautifully arranged and decorated! If you get hibachi, the shrimp sauce is not too runny and the meat is cooked to order and cut into small pieces rather than huge chunks. The meat and vegetables always taste fresh.\n\nTheir prices are extremely fair--maybe even a little low--for the quality and quantity of food they serve. The building they're in now seems a little too big for them and is poorly decorated; but like I said, this is not a high-end Asian steakhouse so maybe you should expect as much. The facility is usually pretty clean and the booths/tables are in good repair.\n\nMy only complaint is that the service is generally AWFUL. Their servers are obviously untrained and can get very obnoxious; when they hand you the menus (which, by the way, are paper ad sometimes re-used a few too many times before they are tossed) they expect you to know what you want right away, then come back too soon and repeatedly to nag you about your order. Usually the food is ready promptly, but once I waited 40 minutes for a simple sushi order while my boyfriend's hibachi meal arrived quickly--he was done eating before my food even got there. A few of the employees are very friendly, but most of them don't seem to care about the customers at all and it shows.\n\nSo: great food, lots of variety in the sushi, but get it to go if you don't want to deal with the shitty waiters!"
2;Need a 1/2 star button. 3-1/2 stars here. Tried tamale chx salad and raspberry tea. The chx salad was good (grapes, celery, green onion, almonds) sliced so thin makes not one thing overpowering..tamale was not bad not dry somewhat flavorful...they were out of strawberry honey tea, settled for raspberry-typical... Meal was only $8, not bad..probably won't be back except to try this strawberry-honey tea ppl are yelling about..very friendly and fast
3;R.I.P.\n\nChocolate Swan \n[January 1983 - March 2009] \nResident of Mandalay Bay\n\nAfter a courageous 16 year battle with erratic consumer demand and developing trends, Chocolate Swan passed away peacefully at their home in the Mandalay Bay.

1;How bad is it when you don't want to go to Target?\n\nThe issue I have with this Target location is the crowd capacity. Every weekend it's like Christmas shopping season. You can see the packed parking lot from 51. I personally would rather go to 3 different stores in less crowded areas then go to this target on a weekend. In fact I have driven out of my way to go to Wal-Mart in Indian Trail just so that I don't have to go to this Target. The designers should have doubled or expanded this location a long time ago and now with the addition of the fresh food department to the store I'm sure even more people will be shopping here.
0;"One star just because it is the lowest score I could give it. If there was a zero star option I would give it! \n\nWent there with a few family members, one being my grandmother. It was a busy Saturday and there were vert few bowling balls available. We wait for awhile and still had little lighter bowling balls to choose from. We spoke with the staff, which were NO help. They stated that bowlers were allowed one ball per person. Clearly most people there didn't get that memo. We asked if we should speak with patrons about which bowling balls were not being used or if staff there would be checking. They, of course, suggested that we check. So my cute little granny and I went to each lane and asked and of course, no one was \""willing\"" to give up a bowling ball. I believe there was some large childrens group there and seriously were lacking parental units. It was borderline chaos! We let staff know that most people were unwilling to give them and staff said, they would look into it. I also let the staff know that we would be waiting to hear back and that my elderly grandmother who happens to have hip problems could not lift any of the heavier bowling balls. We were in no hurry, so we waited another 15-20mins to hear back from staff. We decided to go ahead and maybe try a few frames out with the few bowling balls we could find. My poor granny could not even pick up the bowling ball let alone throw it. We decided to stop right away and end our game and make sure she didn't get hurt. When we went to return our shoes and let staff know WHY we were leaving. Their exact words were... \""Oh well. Bye!\"" This was from the MANAGER! Older gentleman with glasses and salt and pepper hair. He even tried to make us pay for the game! We hadn't even thrown one frame!! \n\nSteer clear. Shenanigans, poor service, and lack of respect for costumers."
0;Is there a way to put a negative star. This place deserves it. It was the first apartment I moved in to post parents. Cheap and all I really needed. I stayed in my one bedroom for 3 or 4 months. I actually like the one bedroom best but it still wasn't great. It's in a bad neighborhood. I stayed in the inside near the playground so I always heard kid yelling and screaming. \n\nEventually I got a 3 bedroom with my friends and moved right upstairs from where I was. Worst apartment I have EVER HAD! When we first moved in there there were multiple problems. The worst was the bugs. I hate bugs. They were everywhere and it was disgusting. I eventually had to walk down to the office and ask to speak with the manager personally. She then talk to me and it took weeks to find out what the problem was. Ugh! \n\nWorst part was leaving.. I got charged sooooo much for all kinds of crap. They didn't make me aware of my early leaving. Over $1800. I couldn't believe it, worse they didn't send it to me so it went to collection.
1;The staff here was very kind and helpful. I found it interesting that you could buy the hotel room you where staying in... The modern look of the hotel was appealing to me, but it didn't quite carry over to the rooms. The furnishing in the rooms were cheap and felt like they may break when using them. One plus is there was free internet that worked well. The biggest problem was parking, which is valet only ( understandable). It took over 30 minute to retrieve your car from valet. The experience was just okay for the price that was paid.
4;Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure.
0;This restaurant is out of business. I was really disappointed!
1;The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me.
2;This is a good pizza place, but not up to all the hype. If you want a great pie, then take a trip to LA and visit Monzza.  Monzza makes the best pizza in all the land.
1;I sort of kind of really really wanted to like this park, but pulling in it clearly was going to be the lesser of all Phoenix 'mountains.' \n\nIt's not a big place and in some places it's littered with garbage and broken bottles, I even saw a dirty diaper. Listen, there is nowhere in the world that anyone wants to see a dirty diaper, FYI. I don't even want to see it in a garbage can, much less in the middle of NATURE. \n\nThere is also a horse corral near so you get that lovely aroma along with hoof prints everywhere. It gets more peaceful and beautiful the higher up you get, but I was even sort of discouraged from HIKING by one of the riding guys. I thought those hills were for hiking. Apparently not.\n\nIt can be pretty, it's easy to hike and there are a lot of pretty rocks, but if you want something that will take your breath away you might want to go to Camelback or Superstition, etc.
1;I have had their Veggie Hummus Wrap which is super fresh and super tasty one other time. Two days ago, I went for a return to visit to find several people waiting for their food and it wasn't until after I ordered, I noticed one worker doing ALL the work. Yes, flying solo, doing everything on her own. This girl was amazing, she did the register, the smoothies, and all the food on her own. By no fault of her own, it made wait times frustrating and long. I'm not sure why there would be one person working. Perhaps, a no show or sick call? Who knows. I do wonder how much one values his or her business when he or she doesn't provide adequate staff. I saw several people walk out and I'm not sure I want go for another return visit. Especially, if I'm in a time pinch. Two stars because their employees seem to work hard (when they're actually there) and the food was actually very good.
1;Went here for a last minute Mother's day trip.  \n\nThey were offering a special Mother's Day menu - not impressed.
4;Great Pho. I'm little Saigon area in so cal so I know good pho. This place is good. I have never tried this place due to the bad reviews on yelp. But tried it today and was pleasantly surprised. They have a very big menu. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes!
3;Went to Lulu's for brunch this past Sunday. Great atmosphere, delicious food, super friendly service!\n\nStarted off with french fries and aioli- Probably the best fries Ive eaten in Charlotte. We had four or five dipping sauces from which to choose. They were eaten quickly and with fervor (that's for sure!) \n\nFor my entree I had the burger with jalepeno relish and a fried green tomato on a challah roll - Oh the Challah roll, I wish you were utilized more often. An awesome burger all around!\n\nEveryone I was with seemed to enjoy their dishes as well. \n\nI will be back shortly !
2;Not really worth the price to be honest. It's only so expensive because of the prime location.\n\nFood was okay. Nothing is very outstanding in my opinion.
0;When you look at the decor, ambiance,and reputation you think you are in for a good meal.  I should have known when we went during prime dinner time before the 9 PM Zarkana seating (Zarkana was ok but there are much better Cirque shows than this one) and the place was practically empty.  But it was easy because it was in Aria by  Zarkana and we thought it couldn't be that bad.  I should have Yelped barMASA before eating here.\n\nHere is why barMASA fails: (1) the food is very average (not horrible but not good either - bland and super small portions), (2) service is average, and (3) the prices are ridiculous for what you get.  And this ridiculous prices comment is coming from someone who spent over $1,200 at Joel Robuchon for dinner for 2 the night before (there is a reason Joel can command that price - because you get what you pay for).\n\nWhen the waiter tells you their signature dish - the hamachi with jalapenos and crispy potatoes isn't good - there is something wrong with this place.  The black cod was literally 2 bites and the texture was off.\n\nDo not eat here you won't enjoy your food as its nothing special and you definitely won't be full.  After I got back to LA I had Sushi Gen (4.5 stars) and Hama Sushi (4 stars) - both were excellent and I paid less than half of what I paid at at barMASA and got twice the amount of food at significantly better quality.  Don't waste your time nor your money here.  This place was so bad it compelled me to write my first review...that says something.
3;only been there once and have no complaints.\nim not a huge fan of sushi, but actually tried a variety of things at this one and LIKED them. \n\nthe service was SUPER good. The lady that served us talked like she knew us for years. we were also there till closing and the rest of the staff started conversations and joked around as well. very easy going there. which is a big plus.\n\nits a little tiny cute place tucked in the corner.\ntheir prices arent bad at all.\n\nstacie roll, YUM.
3;As you walk in it smells like chocolate! Delectable treats at every turn. I had the steak sandwich with waffle fries...yum! Aioli was a great and accompanied the fries well.
1;I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff.
2;"The Blake hotel is a work in progress.  It is, overall, a cheaply made 1970's hotel in the process of being renovated into a modern hipster hotel on a budget.  When the renovation is someday complete it will probably be very nice but for now I rate it \""adequate\"".\n\nI stayed here for $99/night, so that makes me more lenient towards the Blake's shortcomings than I would be if it hadn't been so affordable.   I'd stay here again if I got that kind of deal.\n\nThe Good: very spacious rooms.   Firm beds (I like mine firm).  Nice views.  Friendly staff.  1/2 mile walk to the main downtown corridor on Tryon street. Good conference facilities.\n\nThe Bad: staff are nice but amazingly disorganized and very very slow.  Many things (thermostats, electrical wiring, plumbing) are not upgraded.  Can't turn on the shower without standing underneath it.  \n\nAs for the restaurant/bar at the Blake: don't.  Just don't.  It's not worth it."
3;Beer was great, atmosphere was great, food was great.
0;Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.
4;Great place! Incredible pedi's at very reasonable prices. The suite is clean and well maintained. They offer a variety of services so you almost have one stop shopping (add a hair salon inside and it's the whole package!). \n\nI had the cucumber pedi today. $35 gives you a standard pedicure with callus remover, paraffin wax, hot rock massage and a relaxing experience. \n\nI've been to other places, nothing compares. I won't go anywhere else and would recommend to anyone.
4;A few people have told me that La Paz just isn't the same since their move. Back in the day, they were a frequent lunch place of mine when they were on South Blvd.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but went with an open mind.\n\nOn my first visit I had the fish tacos - well one fish and one shrimp.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to try one of each.  They were good.  I would order them again.\n\nThe five stars come from my second visit.  I had the shrimp and steak salad.  They cook the steak perfectly to medium, as requested and the salad is simply phenomenal!   Their sun-dried tomato vinaigrette is delicious and was the perfect match.  If you have to eat a healthy salad, this is the one to pick.  The meat is spicy, tender and char-grilled.  \n\nIf you go to La Paz with expectations of their former self you might be disappointed.  I think they did a great job.  New look, new menu....just the name remains.  Plus, their house wine is one of my favorites.  How can that be bad?
4;LOVE this place!! Wish we had one in NYC! Its amazing! I first fell in love with Panda when I was in Texas a few years back... I loved loved the orange chicken but this time I changed to the Bejing Beef and that was a game changer!! OMG!! That was amazing. It was like generals chicken crossed with hunan beef. OMG! Unreal!! PLS PUT A PE IN NYC!!!
3;I completely dig this grocery, well as much as a dude can dig a grocery store.  I just happen to always go here because it is so close.
0;I usually go to this Einstein's when I have a buy one, get one coupon. This last time though it was pretty sad. I walk in, there's nobody there to greet me. I stand in the empty line right in front of the register for a good 4mins. Then a lady walks by, I was excited for a minute, but then she didn't say anything and just walked the other way. She handed some food over to a customer and the customer gave it right back saying it was the wrong order. She yelled for her coworker and this other lady came out to assist the situation. They discussed the issue while I was still standing there, at this point I was debating leaving. One of the ladies finally said she would be right with me, so I didn't leave. I put my order in, I was in a hurry so I took it to go. I got back to my work only to find out that the bacon was missing out of my breakfast sandwich. Argh!!! Bad service and no bacon?? It's not even worth the buy one get one!
4;"The servers there Kenny, Joe, bus-young man David, are excellent, efficient , knowledge about the flavors etc on menu.  We (3) had the enchilada plate, #10 plate, and tostado plate, each plate was 2 meals in one.  The flavors are very mild, so I could enjoy the flavor, and NOT the spice, it was EXCELLENT! We go after church, extra hungry, so we are really are very happy to get it the food hot and FAST! The restaurant itself is clean and open. You can NOT beat the price there and the food is INCREDIBLE!  Good menu selection.   Great portions.   This will be \""OUR\"" to go place on Sundays!"
1;Went here for pneumonia. Emergency room dirty and packed. Horrible reception staff. Nurses in ER especially Erin was awesome. Went into IMC/ICU for pneumonia and empyema. Docs inserted a chest tube. Which they did not drain enough and ended up hospitalized again 2 weeks later with a new chest tube at mike o Callaghan hospital (horrible ER awesome ICU care and specialized docs/pulmonoligist). UMC ICU had the worst CNA's (Sally was the worst no respect and careless) and nurses (1 good nurse Teresita she helped when she was assigned to me). They were rude. Esp the fact most were Filipino nurses. I am Filipino and my wife is white as snow. They did not treat her with any respect.  Careless and no care for the pain I was in.\nRude, dirty, bad care, bad doctors on decisions to discharge patients when not fully recovered. \nHopefully new president fixes the patient care here.
1;Over the years I have been here many times.  Typically the people watching is great, the food is reasonably good, service above average, and so on.\n\nHowever, this time it didn't cut the mustard.  A simple thing like a ketel one tonic or grey goose tonic, which is what a friend and myself ordered, terrible.  Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.  It would have also been nice if they had spilled a little in the glass, maybe two fingers.  There's wasn't anything.  It was diluted piss basically.  We ordered apps and waited a long time so we cancelled and closed out.  Went across to Yard House, much better.  Even the people watching was marginal - maybe the economy or have people just gotten sick of this place.
3;"Even as a gay guy, I can appreciate these beautiful women.  I thought the host was fine, though overly processed when she was singing with too much reverb and delay.\n\nThe comedian was very funny and racy.\n\nI've seen other topless shows on the strip like Crazy Girls,  but Fantasy felt classier.\n\nFantasy uses the same stage that host CarrotTop, so feel free to use this joke as you are exiting the theater \""Man, CarrotTop's show has really changed for the better.\"""
0;"Let me begin this review by saying the 1 star basically goes to management for handling the situation myself and my niece were in a few nights ago when we dined here before going to see a movie. I had never eaten here before, and I did indeed check the reviews before entering this place, but I threw caution to the wind because they had less of a wait time than Yard House. Oh boy, that's where I went wrong.\n\nThe hostesses were pleasant, and the wait really was not that bad. But then we were sat in this strange booth that was completely separate from the dining room and it was on the side of the bar, but not a part of the bar either because there was a railing between us and the bar. \n\nI'm not going to completely document our experience, but I am going to highlight a few of the more deplorable offenses. The waiter sniffed my drink to make sure it was Dr. Pepper. WTF moment number 1. We ordered pretty simple dishes because we were indeed going to see a movie. My niece ordered a BLT with the Doritos Mac & Cheese side dish. I ordered half a house salad and the Loaded Baked Potatoes with the Pulled Pork. We then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes before our waiter arrived at our table to tell us there was a big party taking up the kitchen and our meals would be out \""very soon\"". So, we missed our movie. Luckily there was another showing an hour later.\n\nNext, we waited again for our food. During this time the manager came up to us and apologized, comped our meal, and gave us a free dessert.\n\nThe meal finally arrived. They brought the incorrect sandwich to my niece. She ordered a BLT and it was a turkey club. She had to wipe all the turkey off of it. The salad was a poor excuse for a salad with tiny witherlings of shaved carrots. The loaded baked potatoes were okay, but the drizzling sauces they put all over it were not my thing. The Doritos Mac & Cheese was seriously one of the worst things I've eaten in my entire life. My niece and I both agreed would wretch right there at the table if we had another bite.\n\nWe then awaited our cookie (minus the ice cream) so we could take it to go. We waited, and waited, and waited. Our server arrived to inform us it was still being cooked (we already about to be late to the SECOND MOVIE SHOWING). I decided to leave, so we walked out the door. Our waiter (running) met us at the door of the movie theater to give us our absolutely cold and disgusting cookie.\n\nSad excuse for a place. It will not last."
3;Really good Thai food!  We got a mix of curry, padthai and another chicken dish.  This is the first Thai place in many years where the food isn't over-powered by fish sauce.  There's still a hint (hence the four stars vice five) but not too bad.  We ordered takeout so can't comment on the service, although, our food was done on time.
1;For the kitsch factor, for something to do for a day, this place is fine.  It's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts.  But it's dirty, it's run down, it's poorly planned, and I wouldn't stay here if my life depended on it.  (OK, MAYBE then.)  I tell people who come to visit all the time to not be taken in by the cheap rates here and at the Tropicana.  There's a reason WHY they're cheap.
0;Wolfgang Struck out on this one.  7 member squad and nobody liked it.  Very bland, very boring.  We're all from NJ & NY so maybe that's why??  Wouldn't spend another dollar there again.
1;came here with my mom for my yearly smoked meat sandwich (visiting the parents, from san francisco, for the holidays). altogether, it did the job and satisfied my craving, but i've had better smoked meat.
0;Went here after lunch at the sushi place next door, and cannot understand the good ratings.\n\nThis is NOT real gelato. It's like a real gelato place because it has a lot of flavors, but the actual product tastes like standard ice cream and was missing the light creamy texture of the real thing. \n\nThumbs way down. I could have gone to a Ben and Jerry's instead.
4;Quite crowded with visitors and very nice music. Awesome!
4;Wo, a great place in the airport. Both the breakfast panini and the cappuccino were perfect and the service was incredibly helpful and friendly. I would definitely repeat the visit.
4;Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!
4;Killer pizza!  If you are from the East Coast than it should be mandatory for you to eat here once a week!\n\nOutstanding garlic knots!
0;I bought my Honda new in 2007 from Honda West and have taken it there for all the maintenance (oil changes) etc. Every time I had an oil change, they always say ALL the fluids get topped off. I had always trusted that they did.  Well, be ware. The last time my oil was changed, my windshield wiper fluid was bone dry. I had noticed the place was unusually dead. I had mentioned to the guy that the windshield fluid was completely empty and he told me that is the first thing they do is top off the fluids. I also noticed that their prices had really gone up since my last oil change. Anyway they were finished with the oil change in record time. When I was on my way home I tried the windshield wipers, and it was still bone dry. So my concern was if they didn't even fill my wiper fluid, then they obviously didn't check the radiator fluid, break fluid, power steering fluid, transmission fluid. Last time I checked, they are considered fluids, are they not? So I went to auto parts store and got some wiper fluid which they should have taken care of for the price they charge. My radiator fluid is low, and so is the break fluid. Well I called them back and spoke to the service manager and asked him what kind of an operation they run over there? He claims he had no idea the guy didn't check my fluids and told me to bring the car back, but I already lost confidence in them at this point. So the bottom line is they have a sign out front that lists all the things they do with the oil change, which I might add is NOT cheap, and all they did was change the oil. But did they really do that even? \nI will not be returning to Honda West based on my own experience and what I've heard from other people. Bu bye.
1;"Not too bad, it's a cheap alternative to eating at the 24-7 or the other fancier restaurants in the Palms hotel.\n\nCheap, too. $7 for breakfast, $11 for lunch. Didn't do the dinner.\n\nBreakfast had an omelette station (they really overpack them), fruit, ham, bacon, and more.  Pastries, but no pies or ice cream, though. Ends at 10a for entry, I think.\n\nAfter that, the lunch buffet wasn't bad, pasta, pizza, corned beef, turkey, various American Chinese and other dishes that filled the plate and palate with all-you-can-eat goodness stuffed to the gills. Overall not a bad selection of different foods, including a Middle Eastern roast chicken dish. Different.\n\nIf you're a hotel guest or card holder, you get into the \""faster\"" line, and the regular drinks, I was impressed they had three types of sweetened ice tea (I had the green tea w/honey).\n\nService is a bit slow.  It is smaller than most casino buffets that I am familiar with, but not bad overall. Cheap. Order drinks separately at a different price."
4;Really good Sushi, all you can eat menu for 20-25$... pretty reasonable price if you can pack in 25-50 rolls of Sushi in one sitting. Ingredients are always super fresh, the caviar eggs are small and delicious, and the chefs do not get lazy and douse rolls with a mayonaise based sauce to make up for a lack of flavor. Definitely the best Sushi place on the West Side, although there might be some better deals east of downtown that merit a look.
1;I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.
4;Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up, with everything you need and/or can think of.  (try the grilled veggies, flank steak ...everything.!!)
2;Very good food.  They just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location. Good food can't really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum.
3;Great place for sandwiches and salads. It's a little expensive for sandwiches so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. But this place is definitely worth the splurge now and again!
3;We sat outside... It was 104, but we asked before and they said the spritzers weren't up and running yet. We had a great view of the village. Service was great! The staff welcomed us, our server was attentive and we had at least 5 people say good bye to us as we left. We ordered the portobello fries and they were great...(and I hate mushrooms). We stopped in for brunch and it was a fine meal. I imagine if we had ordered the meat options it would have been better, but that is may fault for ordering scrambled eggs at a steakhouse. Bathrooms were clean with a magical salt scrub!!! Good value and friendly staff :)
4;I really enjoyed going to this place. The place was clean when we got there, and I watched the staff clean various times over the hours that we were there. My daughter loved the various play areas, and spent time in all of them. I really liked how thought out and well designed the play areas were.There were areas for crawling babies all the way up to older children. We will definitely come back.
3;I was told this was the best buffet in Vegas and I don't see how anywhere else can compete.  They had everything from snow crab, king crab, steak, prime rib, shrimp, and all of the other typical buffet foods.  More on the expensive side, but you have to go here if you go to Vegas.  All the crab I ate, must have been worth so much at a normal restaurant.  \n\nWhat can I say, when John Wall is chillin right outside, it must be good.  Everything was tasty and very flavorful.  Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas.
0;I live nearby this new location, I have never been to a Texas Roadhouse before so I figured we'd try it some time. When we went for dinner it was a Friday night, around 6 pm. This place was packed!!!! There was a 45 minute wait, but we didn't care because we have never eaten there before. After our buzzer went off we went inside. We were immediately seated. Our server took a little while to appear and take our drink orders, which I could understand since they were extremely busy. As some one else noted this place is LOUD! You can't hear conversations amongst your table. While waiting for my food I started to feel light headed and dizzy because of how loud and cramped this place is. After we placed our order it didn't take long for our food to arrive. The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious, as did everyone's food. But when I started to eat my baked potato, and had already taken a couple of bites I noticed there was something in it... After i pulled what it was out between my fingers I realized it was a friggin eyelash. EYELASH! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! At this point I was already a little upset and disappointed about this restaurant. But now I was completely grossed out. Our server was at the table next to ours. She had been there chatting it up, clearly with people she knew. We called for her attention, 5 time! Finally she decided when it was convenient for her she broke away from her conversation, and approached our table. When we pointed out the eyelash to her she acted like it was nothing, and that people receiving eyelashes with their baked potatoes were a common thing. She asked if I wanted a different potato. DUH I WANT A NEW POTATO!!!!! No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it. My mother-in-law spoke for me since I was so grossed out that I didn't even respond. After that I finished the steak, but the new potato went to waste. As we were leaving, there was a burly looking biker guy who was extremely intoxicated, and rude to my mother-in-law, by saying obscene comments. The people who go to this place are seedy, and so is the service. The only positive thing I can say about that place is that it's cheap. But at that price who knows what you might find in your food. Never again will I eat here. I knew we should have gone to Black Angus...
0;I would do ZERO stars if I could.  Horrible, noisy, dirty, dusty experience.\nStaff was awful, service was worse.  \nBooked on LasVegas.com and they didn't stand behind their service.  I'll never book with them again ... not sure I'll ever go to vegas again.
3;Friendly staff, and great upstairs. Good views of the high street. They still don't get iced lattes quite right, but that's seemingly true for most Starbucks outside the states.
0;When we first starting going to this doctor's office we were very happy and pleased. Unfortunately, things went bad and I will not recommend this pediatrics facility to anyone. I called at 3:50 asking if there was anyway to bring my daughter. The lady that answered the phone put me for 30 minutes. When she finally picked up the phone I asked her if she knew how long I was on the phone? She said do you want to make an appointment as too ignore my question. I said I have been on hold for 30 minutes she came back at me with full force and said it is a Monday and 2 people called in today so we are doing the best we can. I feel very uneasy about a pediatrician's office putting a parent on hold for 30 minutes because that is the best they can do. So after I got yelled at for it being a Monday I again explained I need to bring in my daughter and again I was put on hold. Then after being on hold for an additional 10 minutes I was told there were no available appointment's left for today. I told the nurse that I had requested my children's medical records 2 months ago and I want to know where they are (due to a very bad experience I had with the doctor a few months before this episode) and again I was put on hold. I finally arrived at the doctor's office with phone in hand and still on hold. By the time I got to the office I had been on hold for 45 minutes because that is the best they can do. I was at the office for another 30 minutes while 3 different employees told me one lie after another on where my kids medical records were. So if you calculate it all up I was dealing with them for one hour and 15 minutes and in all of that time someone could of seen my daughter. I gave this office 2 chances with my kids and that was 2 chances too many.   \n\nOne last note...When my son was sick with RSV and I was trying to get ahold of the office I had to leave a message with triage and it took them 3 hours to get back to me. They told me they had lunch that is what took so long. I was already in the ER when they called back and ended up in the ICU of children's hospital that night.
3;We had the lunch menu and it was great .I am sure I will be back next time in Vegas .
3;"Don't let the Pizza Hut exterior fool you; this is a decent place to grab a quick, fresh and cheap sushi combo lunch. \n\nHave been a few times with friends and mostly order the Sushi A combo for $8.95, which gets you two maki rolls (generally go with the California and Spicy Tuna), a ginger salad, and an egg roll. The ginger dressing here is quite good, but be sure to ask for it on the side unless you want your lettuce literally drowning in ginger goodness. The veggie egg roll isn't too greasy and the sushi is average but fresh. All this for $8.95 makes it a great lunch deal if you're in the Cotswold area. \n\nA must have if you aren't ordering off of the combo menu is the Cherry Blossom roll. It's the best roll I've had at Koishi and comes out looking like a flower, which gives it a little extra something, in my humble opinion. \n\nService is a bit on the slow side but generally friendly. And there is plenty of parking on the side and behind the building. Only gripe is that it's tough to get in/leave with the barrier in center of Sharon Amity and the no U-turn signs, but no worries; it's worth the bit of extra maneuvering."
3;Excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)
1;As much as I like to patronize local establishments and small business in general, Roman is more style than substance.  Food portions are small, beer is overpriced and the service is hit-or-miss. Maybe it's just me being a young guy but as far as getting what you pay for,  there is better quality and value to be had.
2;Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken
0;"Incompetent and unprofessional.  I took my car in because it developed a miss, the kind typical of something wrong with the ignition system.  I specifically asked if they did computer diagnostics and they assured me they did.  They called me later with the results - said it needed the carburetor rebuilt for around $400.  I went over to pick up the car and decide what to do.  I asked to see a printout of the computer diagnostic so i could see if the ignition system had checked out OK.  He didn't have a printout.  When I asked more about their \""computer system\"" his answers got really weaselly.  I paid them the Diagnostic fee.  I didn't believe them and took the care to a different shop that I like but that was much farther away to have them check it.  They checked and said the problem was a bad spark plug that was all fouled and showed me the plug, it was a mess.  They had put in a new plug to replace it and they car ran fine.  They said it would probably foul it again because the valve stem seals were leaking.  They also said there was nothing wrong with the carburetor and the car ran great when I drove away.   I went back to the Shell station with the results and asked to speak to the owner.  Supposedly he wasn't there.  I came back later and the same guy was there and I finally pinned him down to at least admit he was in charge and showed him the results from the second shop and explained that with the 1 new $2 plug the problem was fixed.  Asked him how such a clearly bad plug, which I showed him, would not have literally jumped off the computer screen of his \""computer diagnostics\"".  He just try to BS his way around without answering.  I told him I thought they owed me my money back for their \""diagnosis\"" since it was so clearly wrong.  He refused to even consider it.    I wouldn't trust this place to wash my windows much less do any work on my car."
3;"I'd say it's great but not the best. It has the large dance floor, the long bar, the tables for reservations, electronic music, the dark atmosphere with colorful lights - but what it's missing is a place for conversation in case you can't afford the tables. It needs an outdoor area with tables too. It's the classic club, when you think of \""club\"" this is exactly what comes to mind.\n\nWhat I especially like about this place is the crowd it attracts. Lots of of people in their twenties whereas many other places have older crowds in old town. Not a bad thing, just when you're in your twenties, that's what you want to hang around with. Also, there's a variety of ethnicities and there's a balance of males and females, another rarity in old town. \n\nSeems I forgot, there's also go-go dancers and hot staff!"
4;Definitely still a big fan of Vivace. It definitely is (still) one of the best looking restaurants in town with a sweet patio and *stunning* upstairs lounge area. If you're seeking a private party space you must check out that second floor. \n\nService is spot on and are happy to not only describe the dishes, but they go above and beyond detailing the wines on special, where they come from, what the grapes are like, etc. The menu changes up on occasion and I had the pleasure of trying their new-ish chili capellini with crab. While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course. \n\nFor dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato. Vivace is still one of my faves in the QC. Grazie!
3;From a Chicagoan.....wow. Pretty damn good deep dish pizza.  They did forget my salad dressings for the salads. But fuck it. Didn't really want to waste good stomach real estate on salad anyway. Very very very good.  Will be going back for the Chicago dog and Italian beef sandwiches.
0;"I have tried this place about 6-8 times since moving here in 2002 because others rave about it, and I keep thinking it will be different but every time I seem to get something bland. Ordered some sort of peanut-spicy chicken thing and it was basically flavorless and the onions were raw. Are they in a hurry or something? \""Chicken\"" tasted thin and rubbery. Place was SUPER noisy - do NOT go on a date there! Ling and Loiue's on Shea and 96th blows this place out of the water in every category."
2;I promise I am going to give this place another shot at providing a better experience.  I always want to write a great review of a place.  Their sushi was really good, although i took it to go, it might have been even better if i ate it there.\n\nThere seems to be a pretty good happy hour menu that is on my list of happy ours to try.\n\nAs I was waiting, I noticed the music was loud, so conversations might be a little hard to have here.  The prices are pretty much in line with other valley sushi restaurants.\n\nSo I hope to actually dine in and upgrade my review.
2;Awesome property, bur the first night our room smelled like onions & ketchup.. Tonight it smells like fish sticks. We want to move but nothing is happening. Lame!
2;We recently moved to the area and were happy to find such a unique little market, but after going there several times in the last 4 months I'm a little underwhelmed.  They could easily be a 4-5 in my book if they made some changes, but at the current state they are fairly a 3. The atmosphere I love, colors, theme and overall look but they are lacking in consistency and very limited vegan options (zero for breakfast that I could tell).  The best part about this place is the soy coconut lattes which are to die for (if you happen to get a good one).....the problem is you've got about a 50/50 chance of that actually happening.  Sometimes they suck altogether.  The service is also very inconsistent....there always seems to be one super friendly hard working person and then someone that is just standing around sucking up air and not helping the other person even when there is a line 10 back.  I always end up feeling bad for the poor guy stuck doing all the work and over tip for a shitty $5 cup of coffee because they are too busy to put together a decent latte.\n\nAlso, they offer vegetarian and vegan cooking classes but very few vegan options on the menu? They do have a decent selection of frozen and dry vegan options that you can buy but 30% higher than other places which I understand is because they don't have the buying power other places do but sorry I'm not going to be doing much shopping there.\n\nI will continue going back because I don't know another place that has coconut lattes and am hoping that some day I'll walk in and see some more vegan options.
3;"State Of Mind is a rather \""cool dude\"" hip hop styled shop with tees, baggy tops and jeans, trainers, belt and various other accessories.\n\nIt's very American represents a rather niche market as apart from some of the t-shirts, I don't know many guys who fit the bill for the hot and happening clothes stocked here.\n\nIt's well stocked, well organised and as far as prices go, rather reasonable. It's nestled in amongst other independent shops on St Mary's St. and I guess, caters for it's target audience very well. There aren't any other shops like this in Edinburgh so if this is your thing, then you'll be in your element in State Of Mind."
3;I recommend a visit for two. Order one thing from each part of the menu: Start, Smaller Plates, For Sharing, Finish. We did just that and had an unexpected and delicious experience. We shared everything. The dishes came out one after another and not one disappointed in flavor or aesthetic. We found drinks to compliment the meal. Our service was excellent.
1;This airport is only coveted for the destination that it leads its fliers too... the view of the Strip is the only thing that redeems this hotel. The tacky slot machines in the center of the terminal is one thing, but they dont even have a smoker's lounge (its vegas for god's sake!) There are not that many options for food at the airport. Also, it is a TINY airport with a lot of traffic and THE TRAFFIC LINE OF DOOM in itself is a catastrpohe. To its defense, you can drink while you are in line, which i saw many people doing.
0;Stay away from this restaurant!.  Their food is loaded with grease, fat and soy sauce.  The most disgusting Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The only thing they do well is tape unwanted flyers/menus on resident's doors, no matter how many times you ask them to stop.
2;Foods okay. The chips were cooked there and its kinda quiet inside and not busy at all when I came on a Thursday's at 330 pm. I did a Togo order ...and order a salad ....and when I finally went to eat my salad ...they did not put a fork in there.....I was to far to go back....Was upset about that ...and the atmosphere was down ....the sandwich guy looked mad.... and the girl at the register was a little sad ...like she didn't want to be there.....this was my experience when I went.... Wow it's been sitting in rough draft for 1 or 2 years.... I wonder if it's still there and if so.... Is it the same ?
0;BEWARE!!!!\n\nI HAVE BEEN TO BEAUTY BRANDS SPA SERVICES TWICE AND HAVE BEEN OVER CHARGED BOTH TIMES!!!  That's 100% of the time!!!  The first time, my mother-in-law took my daughter to get a haircut, I had called twice- once to check availability and once to book the appointment, and both times I confirmed the price.  When my mother-in-law came back I saw the receipt and saw that they had overcharged us by $10.  I did contact them and they refunded me the $10.\n\nI decided to give them another chance and took my daughter back there to get a manicure a few weeks later, again I confirmed the appointment and price when I called.  We arrived 5 minutes before the her appointment time.  She was checked in, and then we waited.  The staff walked by us numerous times, two of them including the manager, were chatting at the desk behind us most of the time.  Finally, 15 minutes after the appointment was suppose to start, I went back to the desk, to confirm the appointment time.  The manager who had checked my daughter in acted like she had never seen us before.  I confirmed that her appointment was at 1:00pm, she said yes.  When I mentioned that it was now 1:20, she said she would check on things.  My daughter was taken back at 1:25.  When she came out, her nails were completely wet.  She said they didn't have a dryer- kinda surprised since they say they are a spa.  She also had hang nail, that they didn't even clip.  As we were checking out I noticed they had charged me $29 instead of the $17 they had quoted me.  Then the girl checking me out, pulled out their brochure and showed me where it said $29, but the brochure said that was for a pedicure.  I pointed that out to her, and she changed the price back to $17. \n\nWe then went home where my daughter waited 2 hours before doing anything so her nails could dry.  Then at 5pm, ( 3 hours after we left), she went to reach for something and the polish came of the center of her thumb nail!  \n\nI won't be going back.  If they overcharge the same customer twice, it's pretty obvious this is their usual standard of operation.
2;Attended here for the yelp summer soire...when you first arrive the outside is a little dated but as you enter it is a huge space, large enough for private events, I really like the feel of the place and would love to come for a scheduled concert event...it is very dim in the place as well. Has a Nice size bar. Since everything was free didn't get a feel of there bar to be able to get an accurate review. Overall the place is very inviting and clean. Would love to plan an event here soon.
3;I really enjoyed my evening at fifth and wine. The atmosphere was great and the service was attentive! I would recommend this And would visit again!
1;blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM
4;The California Club and Breakfast Buzz are both amazing
1;"The two stars are for service only.  Otherwise, the food does not get stars at all.  What have you done, Haus Murphy???  I've been coming to this restaurant since before it moved to its current location.  I lived in Germany for nearly 4 years, and the food was amazing.  I found Haus Murphy when I moved here and was overjoyed that the Schnitzel was very close to the \""real\"" Schnitzel in Pruem, GE.  But, someone has gotten hold of the ingredients.  Perhaps the quality and pride in the food got lost somewhere in all the times the restaurant has changed hands.  They have either decided to cut back on good, quality ingredients, or just don't care anymore.  My last two visits left me wanting.  As another reviewer put it, the food used to be really good, but now it's \""meh.\""  The only good part of the meal was the mushroom demi glace.  THAT was really good, and covered up the blandness of the dish.  The portions have really been cut back, as well.  Tiny bit of potatoes.  No bread basket anymore, unless you pay for it (way too much money), and the dessert was bland and too gooey.  Strudel crust is supposed to be flaky and crisp!   Service was excellent., however.  We sat on the patio, and some moron allowed his two little daughters to run up and down the patio, screaming and dodging in and out of the tables and wait staff.  One waiter was terrorized by these brats, as he had to swerve several times to avoid colliding with them.  He was nearly tripped with full plates in his hands, but never changed his expression.  Just carried on.  (People, please teach your children how to behave in a restaurant!! )  I know we won't be going back.  Husband was NOT happy with the amount of the bill compared to the unremarkable food.   I'm sad."
0;This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.
1;Six of us dined prior to seeing Celtic Women last night.  Very disappointing, very!  Made our reservation 2 weeks prior to going to Bravo Franco.  Hostess wanted to seat 6 of us at a bar window!  Portions were ridiculously small on the Virginia Spots, three meals should have equaled one.  Mentioned this to the waitress and she did nothing to rectify.  Bread pudding dessert was not good.  Taste was bland and service mediocre.  Will not be going back, ever!
3;Very nice place, Ate on outdoor patio. Shared a bottle of really good Riesling wine. All the food we had was very good.
2;I play a lot of poker and do not get me wrong now that I live in Las Vegas I believe the Bellagio is a great casino. I am slim and I cannot stand the position of all the tables. It is crazy you are always rubbing up on someones chair going to the restroom. Please fix that Bellagio and space them out somehow. And my only other complaint is when I was on the 2/5 nlhe game I was starving and so I ordered a falafel sandwich. And I thought to myself Jesus Christ did she just roll my food up to me on another poker table chair with a towel on it!!! This is the mother clucking Bellagio this casino put class on the map. I swear I had to stare at it for 3 minutes before I said to the dealer deal me out and grabbed my food and went up to my room to eat it. Other then that I love the B.
2;We came here for this place several times and everytime it is fully committed. But hey don't give up that's why we are here now! When I arrived, I asked for a party of 2, and the wait time is 30-40 min, it was barely 5:30! You can tell how busy it is so I will say if you have somehting planned later that night, make sure you have enough time as they do not take reservation. \n\n25 min later we got seated at a small table by the wall. The server came right away and asked for our drinks. They appeared to be nice and friendly. The place is a bit noisy because of how busy they are but that's how most Asian restaurants here, and I actually think it is more authentic that way.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, we ordered Beef Skewer (No.6 on Appetizer) It was amazing! The sauce that came with it is creamy and yummy! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered pork pad thai which is amazing as well. But for my yellow pork curry, I am not too impressed. I think personally I am used to Indian curry which is thick and creamy , so when I tried Thai curry , it is too watery for me. The veggie inside is not too cooked in my opinon, and I ordered a 7 out of a 10 spicy scale  which is way too spicy than any other 7 at other Thai places.\n\nAfter all, I still think of it as a good Thai food option, but I kind of think it is over rating on yelp, especially after a 30min wait. I still prefer Le Thai on Fremont Street better. \nBut I will return and try some other items on the menu if chances come.
3;Had dinner here for business, and it's a very nice restaurant. NY strip was cooked perfect and was very good. Creamed spinach side was also very good, mashed potatoes were average. NY style cheesecake was awesome. Service was over the top. Prices are high, but I wasn't paying!
3;First time and food was good. Ribs fell off te bone and loved the baked beans.
4;"I knew that the next time I came to Montreal I was going to pop my Garde Manger cherry.\n\nMy first time was everything I had hoped for, and more!\n\nWe made a reservation (smart idea), and were seated right away at the bar. Perfect place to sit for a small group of 2 or 3! \n\nMust have - Lobster Poutine. One might think this is probably Chuck Hughes' most overrated dish...but trust me, it was well due the accolades! Absolutely delicious. Poutine with just the right amount of \""fishiness\"" added to the gravy, curds, and frites. We also had the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork (equally amazing) and the Pierogies & Pork Belly (yum). \n\nService was great. Ambience was perfect. \n\nIt's a great feeling when a restaurant can live up to high expectations! I can't wait to come back again and try other items!\n\nC'est tres tres bonne!!!!!"
2;"Went for lunch here with my boyfriend and the setup/environment was quite nice. It felt like a different homey kind of place.  The food tasted pretty healthy, (mine and my boyfriend's) I ordered the couscous salad with strips of beef and dried up cherries while my boyfriend had a delicious turnip soup.  The service at first was great :friendly, welcoming. But then towards the end, one of the waiters was quite rude when I asked for the bill. He kept pointing to the bill and saying that was the bill several times. I was confused because there was no price on it, it just told me what I ordered. My boyfriend then told me I could pay at the cash. Um, why didn't the waiter just tell me to pay at the cash instead of wasting my time and continuously pointing to my bill and saying \""That's the bill.\"" Yes, I know that is the bill...Food was generally good though. Very healthy and tasteful. I give it three stars thanks to that weird waiter."
0;I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.
1;Hoping this is very much an interim review because my experience was so bad that I  managed a bite, waited for family to finish eating, and then went to get some bad food ( jack in the box) to cheer me up with the refund. \n\nThe latter was  fast and hot ,the antithesis of the Bueno Burger meal.    I will stipulate that the results of the evening were heavily influenced by under-staffing and a first night on the job cook  regardless half an hour to be served a chill bun, with tepid meat dragged down by cold ingredients ,in a very cold restaurant , was unpleasant to touch let alone stick in the mouth. That it comes at a premium was just annoying. \n\nSide onion rings were not hot either  which is kinda a no-brainer to get \n\nThankfully the manager ,in charge , probably the best thing about this place, has a clue  and  refunded mine and gave us a card for a future burger because there's a real disconnect between the reviews and our experience last  Friday and I wouldn't mind being proven wrong.
0;I'm a hardcore knitter, and whoever was working behind the register, it was a man, couldn't have been bothered with customers that day. Didn't say hello, didn't ask if i needed help or even acknowledge my existence. When I walked out and said, oh, well thanks, have a great day I didn't even hear anything back. so sad.
3;Since the last post my diet has changed dramatically. I had to learn how to find the right places to eat and Acacia was one that I now frequent because they are super flexible and when I told them what I couldn't eat they offered up alternatives.  THAT WAS AWESOME!  Sometimes it doesn't seem like the lady at the front register isn't so friendly but once you get to know her you realize she does care. It's quickly becoming one of my fav's.
1;The falafel pita was ok, nothing special. The pita chips were soft and soaked with oil (I could squeeze out the oil). Overall it was disappointing. Pita Jungle tastes better and is healthier, and costs about the same.
3;Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!
4;"We made a quick stop for a late lunch as we were drove through Wickenburg the road from Phoenix to to Las Vegas. The food exceeded our expectations and was served up faster than most \""fast food\"" restaurants. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, baked beans, sweet potato fries, and potato salad. My wife thought the sweet potato fried were the best she has ever eaten. I thought my brisket sandwich was great until I tasted the pulled pork, which I rated even higher. The baked beans were to die for. And to top it all off, they served up a warm triple chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Wow!"
0;Hot. Mess. No other way to describe the fact the sushi belt had no plates as it rotated endlessly, leaving hungry diners staring longingly for some morsel of food.\n\nService staff was frantic, literally running between tables. We were sat by a frazzled waitress who forgot about  us after dropping off our drinks. After sitting and watching the sushi-less sushi belt go by  for about 10 minutes, we got up and paid for the drinks we didn't even consume. What did frazzled waitress do? Not even acknowledge or apologize for\nthe lack of service.\n\nI wanted to support this small local restaurant but rest assured I will not be back any time soon, many more deserving establishments out there who deserve the support.
2;It is highly recommended by my colleague down here.  The atmosphere is great, cowboy themed restaurant and this is a great band playing.  We are seating by the windows and you can see a great view of Phoenix.  I ordered a T-bone steak but I have to say the the steak is good except it is not hot enough.  It will be much better if they can heat up the plate a little bit before they served the steak.
1;I have passed by this place for years and always promised myself I would give it a try sometime.  so last week having some free time I decided to have lunch there.\nI had the jerk chicken with rice and the plantains.  The chicken was tender and tasted ok but nothing to get excited over.  I enjoyed the rice with red beans,\nI wish they had a soda fountain as I do not like paying a buck fifty for a can of soda. \n  They did give me a little extra for free however.  About 2 hours after a dined, my stomach began to rumble and I spent the next 36 hours carving  a path between my bed and the bathroom.  Needles to say I am now ruined for Caribbean Spice and probably jerk chicken also.
4;One of my favorite spots in downtown!! Where else can you drop $8 and walk out with 2 nathans hot dogs, 1 deep fried twinkie, 1 deep fried oreo and the 1 football beer!! The pretty ladies in the front either lay you or bead you when you walk in as well. \n\nThe slots are fun if your into getting wasted on drinks and playing pennies or nickels. The cheap food is definitely where its at for me and next door is the cheesy souvenir store as well as the Gultch. \n\nDowntown Las Vegas is where its at!.
3;We go here quite often for lunch. The food is excellent. Service is friendly, but spotty. If your in a hurry for lunch, I would advise you call ahead. I think perhaps the time it takes is because food is made to order. A great thing for the quality and taste but not so much if you have a limited amount of time. The lunch specials are a fantastic deal, and no matter what else I get , I get the spinach salad. It's scrumptious. Definitely recommend this place. Dinner I have had a couple times and the food was good, but the lunch deals are awesome!
3;I went to Z-pizza with a groupon now coupon the other day and was very impressed. I got the Berkley vegan pizza and it was truly a GREAT vegan pizza. All of their pizza smelled so good and I am now IN LOVE with their wheat crust (they also offer gluten-free crust). This place is a must-try for any vegan or non-veg pizza lover.\n\nI will definitely be back!!!
2;Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual, and I don't mind the wait.\n\nIf  you don't like to wait in line to order your food, you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.\n\nThe location is usually very clean, loud either from the music or people talking, but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.\n\nThey have very good guacamole for a fast food place, and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well.
2;Loved the shepherd's pie.  Waitress was good and attentive.  I love Irish bars.  I think it's best place I have gone to for a place on Fremont Street.
4;My favorite Restaurant in Phoenix by far, I keep searching for better, but who knows why!\n\nDishes that separate Tarbell's from others:\n\n Soups to die for\n Caesar the way it was meant to taste\n Pommes Frites as heavenly as any in Paris or \n                                     Brussels\n Sliders to crave many days after\n Scotch Beef I continue to dream about\n Pan Roasted chicken - I NEVER order chicken in a \n                                     Restaurant, except here\n Mac & Cheese good enough for dessert\n\nIf this isn't FIVE STAR in Phoenix, I can't imagine what is, but I want to go there!
3;We came here on our last nite in Vegas yesterday.  We wanted to sit outside but the wait was an hour and we had a flight to catch so we just ended up sitting inside. the food, I thought it was pretty good.  We did the restaurant week menu.  which includes:\n\nBuffalo Mozzarella in Carrozza : mozzarella wrapped in house made pasta, heirloom tomatoes,parmesan creama, balsamic roasted red onion, basil flakes -  this was pretty good...very cheesy...i liked it because i love cheese but my friend thought it was too much...good portions and the vegetables was yummy\n\nChar Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak : summer ratatouille, red wine bordelaise, maytag blue cheese croutons, crispy fried onion rings -  huge huge portion, i didn't finish mine cuz it was too much food.  the steak was okay, a little chewy and I normally don't eat steak ... but I thought it was okay \n\nMudslide Ice Cream Sandwich : double chocolate espresso cookies, bailey's ice cream,kahl\u00faa chocolate glaze, caramel sauce - yummmyyy...loved it...\n\nthe meal was 50 per person.  with tips and tax, it was 62 per person but I thought it was well worth it for the size of the meal that we got.  i would definitely go back and try something else next time.
0;I used to like this place and went there every couple of weeks or so, but they've gone cheap and removed all their customer services now in an apparent effort to save money: You have to go to the counter to get a menu, then go to the counter to order, food comes on styrofoam plates, you have to clean up your own table.  \n\nThe food isn't any better and the service and experience is now much worse.  I'm definitely no longer a fan.  The food is good, but it's not not THAT good.  Heck, even Panda Express does better now!  Lost a customer with their cheapness.
4;My man and I go to Yummy grill about twice per week. Everyone I bring ends up becoming a regular. The fish is the freshest and best high quality selection in Vegas- bar none! Eric is the bomb. You WILL NOT be disappointed!!! My man came in eating california rolls and now he's a sashimi buff. Thank god for this place
2;This was my first encounter with any all-you-can-eat establishment, and my two outings here have been pretty good.  China China is in the Omni Centre, which also houses a Vue cinema, Wetherspoons, gym and others.  It thus offers plenty of choice for those visiting the centre who want to eat, and it seems to complement the other choices well.\n\nLet's be honest at the outset - not all of the food on offer is Chinese.  I'm sure I saw a curry or two, chicken nuggets, chips and waffles thrown into the mix as well.  The food is satisfying, if not amazingly tasty.  I guess this comes from having the food sat out for a while.  At my last visit, dessert was where the night really came together, and I consumed something like 12 pieces of cheesecake (an all-time favourite dessert for me).\n\nI would say that the prices are reasonable for the food that is on offer.  There is a small bar, but I find that it is best at these places to just get tap water, to add as little to the fixed price of the buffet as possible.  The interior is contemporary, if a little clinical, in style - but this won't  bother most diners, who will be focused on consuming quantities of food.  The few staff that I did see kept the food stocks high throughout the evening, but to be honest they played little role in creating the experience.\n\nWith China China, you get what you pay for - an all-you-can-eat buffet, and not much else.
2;I've only been to about 4 convention centers in my life, so I don't know how much my input can be taken.\n\nI thought that it was just ok.  The rooms were designed great, but the setup and acoustics were awful.  The sound folks really didn't know what they were doing and the video folks were fumbling around trying to get the powerpoints loaded.\n\nOn top of that, there were 8000 attendees all yelling for water, and the most Mandalay could do was bring water coolers out in the hall ways with 6...yes 6oz cups for people.  What did they think we were going to do? sip the 6oz cups? or maybe keep disturbing the speakers as we got up to refill 6oz over and over?  huge fail.\n\nFood Catering from them was good during our lunch event.
1;We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon
4;We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.
2;Came here one day for lunch with a friend (actually come to think of it, it was before the Brooklyn Bowl event) XD \n\nMargherita Pizza (Low-fat mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and basil) - To my surprise, i didn't know there was roasted garlic in this. If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X\n\nBison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....) Im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it, i didnt feel so healthy. LOL  \n\nOverall, nice place. A bit on the pricey side. These two items added up to i believe around $24? I guess a price to pay for fresh/organic? ingredients. May try other things next time since i think i picked the fattiest item on the menu.
2;searched for VPN pizza places and found this place.\nWe showed up at 5pm on Thursday and said they had no openings and we had to have a reservation but they squeezed us in right away.\n\nThe bread and oil/vinaigrette is really really good and we asked for more since we had 5 of us and they charged us $2 more. never heard of that. wow!\n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas. One was a specialty pizza with mushrooms and it didn't have red sauce and the other was not a specialty pizza and it had red sauce.\nWe didn't like the specialty pizza and the mushrooms where real soggy and mushy and it was kind of gross.\nThe regular pizza with the red sauce was pretty good but the pizza it self was really soggy and I hate that when my pizza is soggy.\n\nI would maybe try it again because hopefully the pizza wouldn't be soggy next time and it would have to be with red sauce. id rate it 2.5 stars but since I cant I will give it 3 since they squeezed us in.
3;What's with the 1 stars? Are you kidding me? I'm just going to assume those people were so drunk they forgot to chew. \n\nThis buffet was GLORIOUS! Part of that is because Gloria is the best waitress ever. She filled my glass of Orange Juice, I chugged it (needing the fluids) and she turned right around and filled it up again! That's great customer service if I ever saw it. \n\nWhen we checked in to the Flamingo we got a coupon book that gave two people $5 off of the buffet. That was a sign from above because there were 2 of us! Normally I guess the breakfast buffet is $14.99 but we got it for $10. No champagne in this one, but it being our last day, I could live with that. \n\nIf you've read any of my other reviews you'll know that I know my way around a breakfast, and this place did too! Bagels with smoked salmon lox and cream cheese, amazing french toast and waffles, a crepe station (ask for banana, they have it!), an omelet station (that will blow your mind! I'll get to that later) and bacon, sausage, an amazing amount of good fruit and everything else. \n\nIt was all to die for. Literally, the best omelet I've ever had, the ingredient were fresh and perfect. The crepe was huge and with just bananas and sugar the perfect amount of sweet. The fruit was better then any we had had so far and even the toast was so good I was eating it dry while waiting for them to make my omelet. \n\nWe were there during the lunch switch and I saw some people eating ribs, and I would have grabbed some if I thought I could get on a plane with that much food in my stomach. \n\nThis buffet is worth coming to even if you're not at the Flamingo. So fantastic. Maybe the best meal we had in the whole vacation!
0;"i was debating whether to stop at Jjanga or Sushi House Goyemon -- i so wished i went to Goyemon instead because I did not have a good experience at Jjanga. \n\nwe got there a little after 12:30pm and it was not crowded. We were seating and ordered right away. The menu says you have 45 minutes to eat for AYCE lunch. The service was SUPER slow. I didn't get my 2nd plate until 45 min later. I was thinking, they better not kick us out, I'd be so pissed.\n\nThe first round of hamachi looked incredible and tasted great. The 2nd round of hamachi were poor looking and was warm temperature! \n\nThe only fish that tasted fresh were hamachi and salmon, the rest of the fish, i can pass. \n\nI just cannot stand sashimi to be warm -- just not sanitary! \nand these fish weren't thick cut either.. they're quite thinly sliced.\n\nsome of the rolls were okay; spider roll was fine. I wish they would serve us faster so I can try different items. \n\nthe waitress wasn't great also, she forgot one of my order and charged us for dinner price instead of lunch. And no matter how i try to make contact with her or wave my hands around, I cannot get her attention at all! I was just annoyed. I was very temped to just walk out the door and not pay because service was that bad. \n\nno, i will not visit Jjanga again. I was glad that I didn't bring friends here, it would have been an embarrassment."
2;I have been shopping in this area for years and have never even noticed this JC Penney location. It's in the far part of the parking lot and nothing is near it making it a less than convenient or easy location to shop.\n\nThe store is organized and seemed very basic and typical for a JC Penney. Now that I know it's there I'll likely be more inclined to shop here in the future, but it's definitely not going to be easy to remember.
3;"I really like this place! It's small but I don't expect a grandiose atmosphere like some of the reviewers obviously wanted.  Like one said \""Go to P.F Changs for that\"".  I love the food here and the people! They are very nice and after you've been there a couple of times, they remember you.  Even when placing a phone order!  I have the house chicken, which is FANTASTIC! It is spicy but not so much that you can't even enjoy it.  They give you big portions, so one lunch special for $5.00 is enough for 2 servings.  $2.50 a serving?!? You can't beat that.  I can't really say anything about the oiliness of the food, since I do not find mine to be oily at all.  The food ALWAYS comes out HOT!  Some much so, that it can not be eaten right away. Never have I gotten my food in 2 seconds as one reviewer did and I eat there often.  If you are looking for good food that is not over priced and just want to eat and not worry about all the decor and what not, then you should give it a try!"
0;I have never been a fan of ulta, but my wife likes nice things, so we decided to come here instead of sephora because it is closer. Big mistake. \nThe store never has anything you need in stock. Ever! The staff is non existing if you have questions or need assistance, and the prices are horrible. You can't even use the coupons they send on 90% of the products they sell. \n\nNext time I will just take the wife to sephora.
3;"Every time we come here the store is immaculately clean!\nAnd they always have something interesting to watch on TV. which is great for me while I'm waiting for my husband to get cut, they also sell the pomade my husband prefers, Layrite. \nSince moving to Las Vegas we have been to High Rollers, Elliot and Co. another place (I forget the name) and this place. The first couple of times we came here he received a pretty good haircut. Wasn't the best he has had (we previously lived in Phoenix) but better than the other places we have been to in Las Vegas. \n(Especially when you factor in the wait time/inconsistency at High Rollers. And \""OK\"" cuts at other places).\nWe have only had one bad experience here, The last time we came, hubby was in a rush and ended up only getting his neck cleaned up, and the sides by his ears, the guy doing his hair didn't understand what he wanted which I thought was pretty simple. One side looked clean and the other looked untouched. The guy also cut him, he had a long thick abrasive scratch on one side of his neck that was bleeding when we left and stayed red for a few days. \nEven aside from the one bad experience, this place is pretty good.\nThe ONLY complaint that I could have about this place and why I gave 4 stars, is that the owner doesn't seem very friendly. Which can make you feel uncomfortable. I feel like every time we come here we've walked into a party we weren't invited to.\n\nOverall, it's more consistent than other places at a decent price."
3;In a bind to go to CES and couldn't believe I could find a hotel this close to convention center that didn't bankrupt me. Great location and found I didn't even have to drive anywhere. Nice friendly place and cool bar/small restaurant inside it. Looked like they were building something in the courtyard I will have to check out next time I am there.  Coming back in a few months.
3;Some of the best hot subs in Vegas.  No matter what you decide on it's always the way you want it.  The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before.
1;"So let me explain . . . \n\nLynn & I are once again in Las Vegas for et another DUI conference.  I know, I know -- it's either Vegas or New Orleans, but hey! both cities know how to drink!  Anyway, after several nights of excellent but \""fancy\"" food, we were thinking something light and Japanese came to mind.  The problem is, we're staying at the Death Ray -- sorry, the Vdara -- and there are no restaurants per se in the hotel, and the Japanese restaurants nearby in the Bellagio or the Aria don't open until dinner.  BUT . . . there is this place called \""Social Hall\"" that opens at 1:00 pm on Friday, so --\n\nNow 1:00 in the afternoon is a DIFFERENT CLIENTELE than a nightclub/bar/restaurant into the evening . . . all we really wanted was some lunch.  So readers would be well advised to a) take this review with a grain of salt, and b) understand it is a review of this establishment for LUNCH, in contrast to the overwhelming number of other reviews in which more sensible Yelpers than I went during the evening hours.\n\nNo complaints about the food.  It wasn't a \""Wow!\"" but we sort of weren't expecting it to be.  The kitchen was out of some things -- I guess they weren't expecting people to eat lunch (but then why open for lunch?), as we were repeated told that a particular dish \""isn't ready yet.  It will be ready for dinner.\""  Uh, OK, but why open of lunch?  The Bento box was fine; the sushi was good.  But overall it seemed to lack that certain *spark* that elevates it above the ordinary.  \n\nThe waitress was simply not interested in us or in our needs.  Water glasses went unfilled.  She never asked us if we wanted to order more sake.  And it took forever to get the check.\n\nAnd the pulsating techno music at 1:00 in the afternoon gets tiresome by about 1:10.\n\nHOWEVER . . . in a move that is VERY unusual for Las Vegas, someone in this place truly cares about coffee!  They have a beautiful Hario siphon setup, complete with halogen heaters, plus a La Marzocco 3-group Linea and three Mazzer grinders for espresso.  The Ethipoian Harrar siphon coffee we enjoyed was superb!  Bonus points for that alone!  \n\nIf I were here for dinner, or if I were clubbing, well, I can certainly understand this place getting 4+ stars in reviews.  But I will probably take a pass on this place for lunch . . . unless it's just to duck in for some truly wonderful coffee."
2;very busy place.  you have make sure you check your plate to see if it's clean.  I had got 4 dirty plates they still had some food left on them
1;2.5 stars, but I'll round down.\n\nReading review online, this was suppose to be one of the best buffets in Vegas.  It was decent, but not something to ride home about.\n\nThe theme is a world buffet, with different stations including Chinese, American, Mexican, Mediterranean and I think Japanese.  Though creative, each station only had a few dishes for each theme, which limitis the buffet.  \n\nMy husband complained that the crab legs were undercooked.  He was not impressed by their selection of seafood, however this is not a seafood buffet.  I had a roast pork that was very juicy, but nothing spectacular.\n\nI'd say, skip this and go out to a restaurant instead.
4;I've only had 1 other colonic at another company, however I can tell you that Las Vegas Colon Hydrotherapy is much better.  Both companies used the same machines, and the process was similar.  However, the customer service was much better at LVCH.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They massage your feet and stomach during the colonic.  (Some people may prefer to be left alone, and they will if you request) However, I think you benefit from getting the stomach massage.  Although, it feels like torture during the process.  Getting a colonic is not my favorite thing to do, but this place makes the best of an awkward situation.  I also recommend trying the sauna which seems to help if you get it done prior to your colonic.  There are many other treatments that I have yet to try.\n\nAlso, they have the most flexible hours.
0;"I cannot believe the following message that I received from the owner of this place.  Here is the yelp message word for word:\n\n\""Heard you were in my pizzeria.\nWe politely ask you not to ask for xtra wet ingredients as this will make the pizza soggy because it is a true wet dough pizza.\nWe trained in naples Italy not California like the above mentioned.\nWe like to tell our customers to watch youtube videos of Da Michele pizzeria.\nThen they know what we are doing and thank god for the thousands of customers we have each week that appreciate the freshness and quality that we bring at such a low low price.\nThanks for trying us but you seem to like the americanized version better.\""\n\nFirst of all, it's obvious that Mr. Classy lacks basic reading comprehension because most of his message doesn't even fit with my review.  For example, he politely (lol, politely, sure) asks me not to ask for extra wet ingredients, notwithstanding the fact that all my pizza had was sauce and cheese.  Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.  I'm sure that's authentic Napoli style, riiiiight.  \n\nI stand by my review (which wasn't mean-spirited in the least!), and it's a shame that this business owner lacks the class and decency to actually take feedback from customers and do something constructive.  Instead, he decides to send a private message acting like I am the one with an issue.  Seriously?  Someone has his undies in a bunch and seems upset with the fact that SETTEBELLO is far superior.  Here's a hint: If you want your business to thrive, then you might actually focus on making peoples' experiences more positive, rather than just insulting them.  Geez!"
0;"They care just long enough to get paid. And that's about it. Their unprofessional front desk administration is my number one complaint about this location. Clueless, careless, unaccommodating, bossy, unhappy, and slow. Come on people, how hard is it to enter text and numbers into a computer nowadays. A real shame because this could easily be made into a real professional business with the right staff. They better call in a business consulting service quick. They are now called \""Health Care Partners\"" I believe. Good luck!"
2;This place just opened up about 2 months ago. It is located right near Retro Bakery and serves up an array of different food. Here you can get a Teriyaki Steak Bowl,Chicken Ceasar Salad Hoagie, Turkey South Western Egg Rolls, and A mini Lemon Bundt cake...yup, you see an array of stuff!!! It is a small place with a nice family running the place. There used to be a few tables in there but because they do not have a public bathroom the tables had to be removed so to -go orders are most likely it -unless you'd like to sit on a chair against the wall with no table.....\nI liked the spicy corn salad, house salad, chicken sandwiches in which my pattie can be dipped in whatever sauce I like (Teriyaki) and their lemon bundt cake is good but the cake could very well come from a box... I did not care for the chicken ceasar Hoagie as the bread was too tough (hard to chew) and the Tomato Bisque soup tasted like straight up marinara sauce.The rice in the bowls need to be less mushy as well...\nEven though items on the menu don't seem expensive it can build up fast as sandwiches don't come with a side or drink.\nThey are new so I'm sure all the little kinks will work it self out and just today the owner gave me a free bundt  cake for coming back...If you are in the area give them a try - they just added some new stuff like fried shrimp,pulled pork sandwiches and I'm told that if you ask you can get Chicken curry on Saturdays & Burgers are coming....
4;First visit and feeling better. :) Hope it continues, will let you know. Clean, quiet though a bit weird being in the strip mall and smelling the BBQ from across the street. Doc was friendly and so was Alicia at the desk.\n\n------Edit------\nAfter a week my back is feeling better and hope it continues. They really seem to care, that's always nice!!
3;I now know where the hipsters are in Phoenix. \nAn easy ordering menu like In-N-Out, but with fresh rustic sandwiches.  \nOnly four different sandwiches, four different salads, and a small variety of sodas in a bottle makes life easy to decide.    \nI liked the quick service, the banter between the staff and regulars, and bench seating.  \nI don't like that it's only open for lunch on the weekdays.\nWhatever they are doing though, they are doing it right, because I think about eating there a lot and their other restaurant Pizzeria Bianco.
3;Mac&Cheese is off the chain.
1;"First of all, I really wanted to like this place.  I've read such positive reviews and I was really looking forward to a great pastrami sandwich.  \n\nI ordered an original pastrami on a french roll with potato salad and a soft drink.  The total bill was $12.88, so I would say a little on the expensive side.  The french roll and the pastrami were both very dry.  I had to keep adding mustard to moisten it up a little.  After every few bites, I had to keep taking a drink just to put moisture back in my mouth.  I've heard they make their own rye bread, so maybe that is better?\n\nThe potato salad looked good, but the seasoning they use is heavy on dill.  I don't like dill at all, and so that is all I could taste.  If you don't mind dill, you might like their potato salad.\n\nBy the end of my meal, I had most of the potato salad and the two ends of the dry french roll left on the table.  I ended up eating the rest of the meat plain.  \n\nMaybe I just caught them on a \""bad\"" day?  But judging that I was there around Noon (the lunch hour), and there were only three other people eating,  shows that this is not a local favorite."
2;Spinning classic 80's and 90's music all night.
2;The only reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the wife and I only stopped by for dessert.\n\nWe ordered the Molten chocolate cake and coffee. Are you kidding me?????? I know its only a molten chocolate cake, but damn this was one extra tasty molten chocolate cake.\n\nIt took them about 20 minutes to finally come out with it. Which was a good sign that they did not just heat up a pre made one.\n\nIt was so warm and a bit crispy served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Your taste buds will moonwalk with joy.\n\nAs far as dessert goes, this place did not disappoint.
4;From where I live I have to drive across town if I crave Poke. Low and behold there is a store right up the street from me. The flavor was not only awesome, but I have been craving to go back ever since.\n   Very modest looking store, but don't judge by that. The food is awesome and the prices are good.\n   Parking can be confusing. Just park across the street and carefully cross over to avoid a possible ticket.\n    I know where i'm getting lunch today.
2;My sister and I ate here on our first day in Montreal. My sister ordered a chicken-cranberry salad that looked out of this world. I ordered the crepes with ham/asparagus/swiss. My crepe had a touch of sweetness that I didn't care for in what I expected to be a savory dish, but it was cooked well. \n\nThis is a nice casual eatery, with healthy options. I would return...and order the salad. Our meals with drinks cost $30 CAD.
2;There's a lot to like about Essence:\n\nThe food here is really good.  Sometimes the portions are a bit small, but the taste is always there.  Same thing goes for their coffee, too, always fantastic and a great way to wake up... a little caffeine buzz balanced out with a breakfast bagel.  MMMM!  \n\nTheir macaroons are really fucking good, too.  I like the tiny ones.  I like miniature things, I dunno.  I like tiny chickens.  I like itty-bitty little cars.  If I could get away with it, I would shrink myself to be about 8 inches tall... but I read a Bukoswki story that made me change my mind.\n\nI don't come here as much as I'd like to because the place is always so over-crowded it's a pain in the ass.  That means they're doing well and I'm glad that they are, but sometimes I like to eat in peace.  Essence is always humming with thirty different conversations going on and clanking plates and clinking dishes.  It's not a very comfy place if you've been out drinking the night before.\n\nAs I said before, depending on what you order, the portions can be a bit small.  I'm fine with that, I think Americans, as a general rule, eat way more than they should and we've been spoiled by such large portions.  So I agree with the portion-sizes here, absolutely, but sometimes it can be a bit expensive if you want a breakfast sandwich.  It's a bit silly to spend close to $10 and get like this small-sized little guy with a single strip of ham.  The food always tastes really good, but it's still overpriced.\n\nThere's a lot to like and I'm glad that they're around and functioning and doing very well for themselves.  I have a few gripes, I guess.  I desperately want a fantastic breakfast place in Tempe but Essence is overpriced and too goddamn loud, Harlow's gives me diarrhea and... what's left?  IHOP?  Denny's?
4;"This place is a hidden little jewel that apparently only locals know about. Since I am now a \""local\"" I know too. Amazing is the only word I can think of. All fresh ingredient and made with love. I had the house made Margarita with no refined sugar at all. Just Tequila and fresh citrus. That's it! Then leeks with fresh mozzarella, bread crumbs and egg on top. Also rock shrimp, razor clams and cheese plate. Wow!  So European and yummy."
0;Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.
0;This restaurant doesn't exist anymore. It was replaced by another Chinese restaurant and there is no buffet (all-you-can-eat) option.
3;I was looking for a chair rental company for our upcoming wedding and contacted RSVP. Our wedding venue coordinator also mentioned that she has worked with them in the past, so I decided to give them a call. I spoke with Lorraine today, and in the span of about 20 minutes she quoted me with a very reasonable price, and has already sent over the contract. I could not be happier with her service, and this is one less thing I need to worry about.
0;"I went to get my nose pierced (my first piercing other than my ears). I was pierced by George, at Tribe 1 in Newington.  He had no bedside manner so to speak - when my friend offered to come with for support, he told her no.  Then when we got to the piercing room, he told me to sit, asked what side I wanted it on, and then proceeded to pierce my nose without asking if the mark was ok.  After he put the needle through he told me I was done, and then proceeded to play around some more, putting the stud in.  He scolded me for holding my breath, and was just generally unlike-able.  I had to go to another, BETTER, piercer today to get it removed as well (it was in for 5 days) as the stud he used was \""too small for an initial piercing and only good for healed piercings\"" which resulted in my swollen tissue swallowing the stud so much that it was trying to grow over the stud.  Bottom line, unless you're an experienced piercee who can ensure everything is done correctly and he is using the right stud, etc, find another place."
1;It was really cold in Vegas and my friends and I didn't want to walk outside any longer. We came back to our hotel at Aria after a late night out and we were starving! Can't go to bed hungry. The only place open with food was Cafe Vettro, which is open 24 hrs.\n\nTheir late night menu doesn't have that many selections. I loveee nachos so I decided to order them even though it was $14. I added chicken to it which was another $3. Paid $20 total for the nachos. Totally not worth it. It was huge though, I couldn't finish it. The taste  was very mediocore. The chicken came in teeny tiny pieces, there wasn't enough guacamole to go around, and I wished they used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese. \n\nThe service was good though. We were seated quickly and our server was funny. He said he had Mentos for us in case we needed it after my friend ordered her burger with grilled onions.
4;"We ended up coming here to eat on a Friday evening after discovering our favorite gyro place on 35th Ave & Bell had been shut down.  We had driven by many times and heard many reviews, so decided to try it.\n\nThe lady who greeted us was friendly and chatty and and took our orders immediately.  There was only one other table occupied.  We ordered the appetizer sampler which came with hummus (awesome!!) falafel (double awesome!!) and dolmas (amazing!!) along with warm pita.  A short time later our entrees came out; I had the lamb gyro with fries, my wife the chicken schwarma with fries and my daughter the beef schwarma with fries.  Everything was hot and fresh and very tasty. Then came the baklava!!  Huge slices of baklava that were to die for.  I have been stationed in the Middle East and this is as good as any food I have had overseas.  The owner spent a lot of time chatting with us; she really made us feel welcome, more as if we were at her home for a meal rather than in a retaurant.  We waddled out, and for all the food we ate it was $39.00.  Well worth the trip and I'll be back soon..."
0;Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.
3;I would give this place an easy five stars but the super discounts like to offer no try on area. I did ask if I could try on without the mirror and they said it was fine so, bring a  fairly large mirror (that fits in your purse) so, you can get some idea of how you look. Anyway, I loved Susies Deals but this is sooo much better because no 5.99 deals. The max is 2.99! This is even better than the Alley in downtown LA because its one store vs lots of mini stores with the same merchandise. There is a plethora of quality closeout clothing and if you wear it a few times you more than get your moneys worth. I know lots of girls get hair, makeup, and nails for a date and easily blow through 75.00 so, what's 6.00 for a new outfit?!
2;2.75 stars. \n\nThe MGM Grand is a sprawling behemoth whose 5,000 hotel rooms feature atrocious, inconsistent cleaning service, weak shower pressure, worn furniture, anemic sound proofing, and paltry amenities (most rooms do not even have refrigerators). But, the room service is reasonably priced and remarkably prompt, with food that is better seasoned than expected (the chicken quesadillas are redolent of cinnamon, cocoa, and ground peppers). And, the fainting couches in the rooms are nicely situated and comfortable, while the pools are irresistible. However, there is nothing special about a stay at the MGM except the plethora of excessively expensive restaurants and the moody black and white photos of classic Hollywood stars who stare eerily at you in the middle of the night. And, while saying that you're sweet, the front desk will blame you because you checked into a rumpled, uncleaned room that still isn't clean later that evening. There are much better themed hotel and casino choices in Las Vegas.
2;"Chainsaw S. have a motto....  Aim low.\n\nYou can't expect anything good from a joint named Terrible's.  Low expectations are the key to good customer service.\n\nGenius.  That's what Terrible's is.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that would have given them 4 stars from me:\n~Throw in a fabric softener sheet with the towels every once and a while.  Good thing I forgot my exfoliator at home.\n~Try not to make your guests feel like they have the world's fattest ass.  I'm telling you, every time I sat on that tiny toilet seat I sang \""Fat Bottom Girls\"".\n~WD40 those elevators, please.  \n\nI had a damn good time staying at Terrible's.  The bloody mary's were good AND free.  The pool was refreshing and relatively clean.  And the best part... it's walking distance to the Double Down, even in heels."
4;Wow, wow, wow! ...or maybe that should be BOW, WOW, WOW! My dog and I did the self-serve wash today and we are dedicated fans after only one visit! Leah at the front desk made us feel welcome and Tim in the wash bays was capable and personable. For fifteen dollars my large lab is no longer a smelly dog. The wash bays lower (great for older dogs with hurting hips...and super for their human parents who don't have to lift them) and raise to a comfortable height. They provide shampoo, warm water, cotton balls, ear solution, face wash, towels and a blow dryer! I'm home and done...no worrying about doing a load of laundry to wash the dog wash towels...no cleaning the tub, shower, or porch of copious amounts of dog fur...and no worrying that a wet dog will roll in the dirt and then jump on the couch! I love it! We'll definitely be back. Thanks so much. You all are wonderful!
4;I have been to a lot of Starbucks and I thought this Starbucks was really clean and it was pretty big inside too.  This year I got a free drink for my birthday.  I was pretty excited about it, because Starbucks is one of my favorite places to go for coffee.  So, when I went up to order my Chocolate Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.  The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup.
0;its 6 month's later  and i still hate this resturant ... i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur..... this place is a EPIC FAIL
4;We've eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food. The deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal! I love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice, it's my favorite! The selection and unique cuisine is top notch!
1;Gluten free and whatever, typical over priced Las Vegas restaurant with subpar food. One dish was so bad we had to send it back and the menu outside the restaurant wasn't even the current menu. I try to order things that are naturally gluten free in a normal manner without asking if it's gluten free. I have severe gluten allergies that make me deathly ill and I didn't have any issues eating here other than the food not bring that great.
4;"I'm from Los Angeles. I have been working with the doctors in my local medical practice for several years now to diagnose the issues I've been having. I even made visits to the USC Keck Medical Center. No one have been able to do more than what they called \""elimination\"" testing. They knew what I didn't have, but no clue what I did have. My neurologist recommended I go and spend a few days at the Mayo Clinic to be seen by specialist who would work together to come to a diagnosis.\n\nAlthough it took 6 weeks to get the initial neurological consult scheduled, their schedulers worked diligently to schedule my other consults within the time that I had allotted to spend at the  Clinic. \n\nI have been in Scottsdale for 3 days now undergoing lab work, tests, and consults. So far the experience has been amazing. From the first check-in, to the scheduling of additional tests requested by the next specialist seen, the schedulers keep your itinerary up to date and efficient trying to consolidate the number of trips and appointments to a minimum.\n\nI come from a medical family, although not in medicine myself, and so have a unique insider perspective on many medical systems. The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale is far and above many that I have personally experience, or that I have heard recounted from family or friends. And trust me I have witnessed horror stories at local hospitals and with local medical groups and specific doctors.\n\nHaving above average knowledge and experience, I spent a lot of time asking questions and discussing what has been eliminated and what we are looking at next. The tests requested and discussions are well above what the previous \""specialists\"" have considered. \n\nI am a total advocate for my care. I have a good idea of how things should go. I also illicit expectations so as to limit disappointment. Yeah it is hard and can be intimidating when you question a doctor, but if you don't understand the why you will not do. I also make sure I have discussed the ALL of the options. Many doctors will only talk about options they like and agree with. You have to do your research and then discuss pros, cons and likelihood of success for your situation. Unfortunately, insurance companies and corporations have made it necessary to question everyone and everything. Gone are the days of \""blind faith\"" in your healthcare providers. So stand up for yourself. No one else will."
2;It's really quaint place and it is nice to see something in that spot in the strip mall.  I was really excited to try this place after being tired of In/Out and wanting something gourmet but also delicious.  It's a little bit more expensive than going to a normal fast food place, but it is worth it in terms of taste.  I got the Sin City burger which has all the things I love, breakfast in a burger + onion straws.  I love eggs and bacon on burgers, and the egg was cooked decent.  A little overcooked for my liking (I prefer over easy), but it's not exactly a restaurant I would assume cooked eggs to the specific likings of costumers.\n\nDownside, although the burger was tasty it was oily.  Oilier than most burgers I've had.  It didn't take away from the taste, but I know when I'm eating it that I'm probably digesting more calories than a normal burger, which makes you feel more guilty than normal.  Aside from that I also had sweet potato fries which were really good until I got to the bottom and the last fries were too oily for consumption. This place also gives me a small vibe of dirtiness.  It's not filthy, but I felt filthy in there for whatever reason.\n\nAll in all, I'll definitely go here again, but it won't be something that I'll definitely need on a regular basis to fill my burger needs.
2;Better than a buffet but not great. Portions were appropriate (small) and too salty. Wish I would have skipped the wine.
2;So much better than I remembered.  Last time we had breakfast here and it was horrible.  This time, we tried dinner. \n\n24 hour buffet pass for $40...how can you go wrong?  Except after the 2nd buffet, you really want to run straight towards a toilet or grab a roll of Tums.  Seriously, no one should be eating more than one buffet within 24 hours.  Heck with it all though, this is Vegas...the city of losing wages and eating just as much as you freakin can!\n\nThis was our 3rd buffet on our pass...a dinner stop. \n\nHighlights:  \nCREPES!!!  Yummy delicious crepes...I take em plain with some powdered sugar. Really nice lady making em...the crepes were perfectly chewy...I had 2.  Ugh. \n\nSeafood.  A combination of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams.  Not the greatest...but good enough.\n\nDessert.  Probably the biggest display out of all the buffets we went to.  They're your usual buffet fare...nothing was really wow but enough to satisfy your dessert craving. \n\nThe duck was also pretty good...it was made with orange sauce and rice pilaf.  Can't think of any of the other standouts as the buffets mostly had the same things.  \n\nPretty decent buffet...#3 on our buffet list.
2;A small restaurant near the eastern end of Roy. There are two types of seating, hard old wooden chairs with backs that surround you on three sides and bar stools at raised tables. The decor is eclectic and anemic. In some ways it feels like a garage sale of items. The food is advertised as tapas and yet, can you really call something tapas if the style is French? Isn't that really more of an amuse bouche, then? Anyway. most of the tapas were nice and the prices were reasonable, with the exception of the beef tartare which on the night we had it, had an off flavour related to the spices. The alcohol prices were a little high, but still acceptable. The soft drink prices apparently were set by someone from Paris or a stripper, because at $4 for a soft drink, I expect someone to be dancing around nearly naked (or at least be on the Champ d'Elysee, with a snooty accented French.) Makes you wonder who is setting the prices, because a glass of milk is just $3, but cost wise is more than any softdrink. Of note, the Fennel salad was excellent. The creme brulee was nicely prepared. The chevre chaud was too sweet for my taste. The salmon was good. But I would skip the tartare. Oh and the Piano man was quite good.
0;"DO NOT ORDER FROM VITACOST!!!\n\nI have never wanted to give a place a negative star rating more than I do this company.\n\nI placed an order last Monday. After it had not been shipped by Friday afternoon, I sent an email inquiring about the expected ship date. I then got onto their live chat with a customer service representative who told me that the order had been invoiced and shipped, it just wasn't posted yet. Later, I found out that she had lied to me and that the order shipped that night, after I had inquired about it. I received an email citing the wrong order number that also included gross grammatical errors (i.e., subject-verb agreement, thanking me for my \""patients\"").\n\nI responded to complain that the live-chat representative had lied to me and also wanted to confirm that the correct order had been shipped because the representative who emailed me had cited a different order number. I also cited the unprofessionalism of the email. I received a response apologizing for the unprofessional grammatical errors in the \""precious\"" email. I received no apology for the lies, however, nor an incentive to try their services again.\n\nI received my order yesterday. It was missing four items and contained one wrong item. I sent a pretty angry and detailed email and posted a message on their Facebook page.\n\nI was contacted via phone today. I detailed the problem with the shipping, lying and now the missing/wrong items again. She said that the problem with shipping and being lied to had been taken care of internally. She was then ready to go. I had to ASK about the missing and wrong items. She asked what they were (which had already been detailed in my last email). She told me I would get a reimbursement to my account in 48-72 hours. Fine.\n\nA little while later, I get an email from a representative and a comment on my Facebook post, both saying that management had left me a message with their direct number to call and resolve the issue. WHAT?????? I just SPOKE with the representative and resolved the issue. They clearly have no clue what is happening in their own company!\n\nThe unprofessionalism and carelessness at Vitacost is unbelievable. I ordered from them to not just save on cost but also on time. The time I have had to put into this is greater than the time I would have spent just going to the store to get everything myself, which I now have to do anyway!"
4;First time here and it was an amazing experience! Julia did exactly what I wanted to my hair and went above and beyond to teach me how to do it myself. Everyone is friendly and the environment is very inviting.
1;"I really wish this place was better - at first glance it's a gluten free diner's dream (I have celiac). Having eaten at Nourish on 3 separate occasions, it's decidedly \""meh.\""\n\nThe menu is nicely varied and has a number of excellent options for anyone with specialty diet needs. I really applaud the owner for putting this place together - though the space is somewhat oddly shaped (the entryway is not inviting) they do have an OK decor.\n\nThe service however is the breaking point - it is very poor. The food has gotten to me cold 2 out of 3 times, we were rarely checked on by server and they were very slow to get the bill 3 out of 3 times. During lunch hour time is of the essence for working individuals, this is obviously not a priority at Nourish. Additionally, price/amount of food ratio is out of whack on a few dishes, nobody likes to spend a lot and walk away hungry. \n\nThey have promised a new menu beginning in April 2011, I hope some of these problems will be addressed then."
0;Gross buffet don't be fooled by that price you get what you paid for and I didn't pay for it.  I walked over to Quiznos and let my friends try this place out.  It's Vegas there are plenty of better buffets around, do yourself a favor and go there.
1;"I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \n\nFor starters, the \""drive thru\"" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your \""food,\"" at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\n\nIt's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe.\n\nOk... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\n\nToday's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\n\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a \""large #3 with Coke.\""  \n\nMcD's Microphone Dude: \""Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts.\""\n\nMe: \""Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast.\""\n\nMe: \""Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Do you want a large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes, and the #3.\""\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""So, that's a #3 with large Coke?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes.\""\n\nMDMD: \""Ok.\""\n\nMe: (long pause) \""Can I continue with the order?\""  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\n\nMDMD: (long pause) \""Yes.\""\n\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\n\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready.\n\nMe: ...drives around...\n\nKid at window: \""That'll be $18.14.\""\n\nMe: \""Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal.\""\n\nKid at window: \""You can.\""\n\nMe: \""So, why all of the confusion?\""\n\nKid: \""I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window.\""\n\nMe: \""Oh, ok.\""\n\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\n\nI returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\n\n\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\n\nThanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure."
0;Never again\n\nGot pink and white acrylics and a pedicure. \n\nThe shine dulled quickly and the powder was poor quality. \n\nWhite turned yellow and it's only been 4 days
0;Do not go here, they charge too much for what you get and rip you off with the ion foot detox, which is a total hoax, these guys should be put out of business.
4;If you like good food, nice people, and really good food then you have to goto DD's. I heart Double D's too and you will once you eat here. I had the Caprese with Salami and Orzo salad with a Dad's Orange Soda. Perfect.\n\nThey gots tons of salads and take home dishes. One huge cheese case and another for the desserts. They also have spices, wine, and beers. The best beers are the ones in the cans BTW\n\nApparently they will be opening a kiosk at the airport in a bit with some other local restaurants. Good food at the airport.
4;"Great craft cocktails, featuring a lot of bourbon.  Drink service is medium-slow, but that's mostly because they spend a lot of time getting drinks right instead of slinging bad drinks quickly.\n\nThe door and windows are covered over; you have to look for it.  That has an enormous benefit; it's intentionally only visited by people who specifically went there, and the hordes of roving drunks in the Southside miss this place entirely.  They seem to be sacking short-term popularity... for long term lasting power as a terrific little bar."
1;"I am giving 2 stars not necessarily for the food, because the mussels were amazing and I highly recommend the Spanish risotto as well.  the reason I am writing is because my dining guest got FOOD POISONING from the Black Linguine Pasta with seafood.. (I assume it was squid ink pasta?) Either way, this wasn't just 24 hours of hell, but it has continued for 2 days now.... cannot keep anything down, doctor required!  I wrote Local Bistro to tell them about the possible dangers with Friday (1-20) dinner, but I never even heard a response back with shows lack of care and overall no concern for their guests...\n\nWe cannot even go there anymore because of this incident.... sadly they didn't even say \""I am sorry\"""
0;If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.\n This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur. \n As for  the service it was average, not anything special.
3;"This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty, it's just the trashy sign on the fountain drink saying not to put stuff in the drain. I also didn't like the \""real\"" trash can being turned around so there's no access to the door and a large \""kitchen\"" grey trash can sitting right beside it. All in all a good visit, but not a 5."
4;This is my go-to Petsmart. The one on Craig is much closer, but I'd rather make the short jaunt up 5th to this location because it's cleaner, it's better stocked and the general area is much more pleasant to shop in.\n\nI've been here a handful of times now and every time they have the product I need in stock (Kaytee Orchard Grass in the 24oz bag for my bunny, Lulu). \n\nThe staff is always really warm and actually act like they love animals. Some of the other locations, the staff sometimes seems like they'd rather be having dental work.\n\nToday, the sweet girl at the register and I were discussing my rabbit and she was so informative about whether or not I could pre-order in bulk and pointed me to their website in the event they don't have it in stock. Standard knowledge, but I appreciated that she offered it up, like she genuinely cared that I got what I needed.\n\nFinally, at the end of our transaction, she lifts up my bags of hay gingerly, apologizing, but saying she's allergic to most of the hays so she was just being careful. I thought that was so sweet! She never let on the whole time we were talking that she was allergic or potentially uncomfortable. She just smiled and gave great customer service. I hustled the hay out of her vicinity, but she made a point to ask as I left what my bunny's name is. I wish I had made a point to ask hers!\n\nThat's how it's done, customer service. Thanks, Deer Springs Petsmart!
3;"We sat at the bar with a bunch of people we didn't know, but by the end people from different groups were chatting. The chef made the night very exciting and lively. I did notice that not all the chefs gave it as much effort or were as excited as ours; we must have gotten lucky. The food was delicious. The fried rice was yummy as well as our main course. We chose the dinner for two, so we got to pick four meats. We chose filet mignon, shrimp, sword fish, and calamari. Everything was great! Although I was a bit confused when out chef served us the calamari, I was expecting a tiny intact squid, it looked like a slab of fish, but it was delicious none the less. It did seem however that a majority of the crowd was getting extremely drunk, they were shouting across the room and talking very loudly. There was a couple of families there with young children, which might have been more appropriate at a table instead of the grill because the chefs play with fire and squirts saki in your mouth. The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for, I was barely able to finish all the food they have me!! Overall it was a fun night and yummy food. I am looking forward to going back."
1;One would think when there are only two other groups in the place they would get the order right but once again another place who seems to be lost in the service department and the food was just OK.
2;My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q).
0;It's gross in here...cobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthy..and how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat bread..and very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere...
2;Don't buy the bananas!  They refrigerate them.  They turn brown by the end of the day. Dole bananas are the worst.
2;Before I finally tried this place, a couple people told me this was the best noodles in Vegas. I has the T. Shoyu noodles & Takana fried rice. Both were filling & okay, but I thought pho was more satisfying. Don't think I'll be back. I tried seeing if they had siracha hot sauce, but the server ignored me. These are only my opinions, perhaps many others think Monta is one of the best as well.
3;The food is good and the service is excellent, especially compared to the Cheyenne location. I had terrible service at Cheyenne location but enjoy the Olive Garden so we come here even though it's about 3 times as far. Either the servers are just better or management knows more about customer service because this Olive Garden is always great to us. Great server, hostess, and Management makes the longer drive well worth it.
2;I will start out with the good - The food.  I had a burger and tots and they were great. I tried my boyfriends catfish Po'boy and it was amazing. The mac and cheese is very good. Onion rings were just okay.\n\nWe went to watch the Pather's game and they turned the sound on. It wasnt very packed and the service was pretty good. \n\nThe bad part - there beer selection needs some help. They only have a few taps but where are all the great local beers?\n\nAlso, a palmeto bug kept flying around us while we were eating. Hard to prevent but still not very fun.
2;This buffet is very strong with food quality and comfort. The buffet has a great feel to it and doesnt look like a buffet when you are seated and see big windows. The good is good and has a big meat and cheese section. However the selections are fairly limited and it is a little smaller compared to a lot of other places you will see in town. The deserts are excellent though.
0;"First visit (and last one) was on Jan 23, 2013. I wanted my dog to get a bath. This business is nearby and had same day availability. I called the business at 1230pm and dropped her off at 130pm. I picked her up at 3pm and all appeared to be fine. However, at 440pm, I saw blood on her dog bed and after inspecting her body, I noticed that one of her toenails was bleeding. \n\nSo, I went back to this business and Isabelle said \""sorry, but your dog must have moved during the process.\"" But I informed her many times when I dropped her off that I only wanted a bath for my dog and nothing else. She proceeded to place some 'ointment' on my dog's toenail but my dog kept trying to pull away from her. Finally, after a few minutes, I told Isabelle to stop but she only did after I said stop 3x.  \n\nMy dog's toenail in question is cut about 1/4\"" shorter than the other ones and still is bleeding almost 4 hours after I picked her up.  \n\nThe foul smelling odor inside this business is obnoxious and maybe should have been my third clue as to not trust my dog in their care. The first indication should have been their abundance of availability and my second clue should have been that they did not even ask for a rabies vaccination certification.   \n\nI'm sure that Isabelle feels bad about my and my dog's experience, but I do NOT recommend this place because of my experience. You and your dog have been warned."
4;"We live in northern Arizona and whenever we go down to Phoenix, we try to go to Halo Halo Kitchen for lunch to get my Filipino food \""fix\"".  Local filipinos frequent this place (a very good sign!)  The prepared foods are always good and fresh!  Love their pinakbet, mungo beans with spinach and the upo dish!  Love their sticky rice -- not dry like rice at other Filipino and Chinese restaurants!  Always have their special halo-halo (the Best!)  The prices for combination dishes are very reasonable!  When sons of the owners are serving, they are always friendly and very accommodating!"
1;I was suffering multiple G.I. symptoms, like stomach ache and bloated belly (intestine area). The doc immediately ordered a very expensive endoscopy procedure ($3000 total WITH insurance). He said I could try different meds to find out what is wrong if I didnt want to do the procedue. But I have no clue it would have cost so much and didnt want to wait months after months of trial and error with meds so I did it. \n\nWhen I went back to see the results, he was only going to prescribe meds for my stomach, not telling me what I should do with my unusual bloatedness that is way below the stomach area. I reminded him my intestinal bloatedness was about to cause me to explode, and it's not just in the stomach, it's in my small intestines, he turned all sarcastic on me and asked why didn't I tell him what to do now because I sounded like I am the doctor. He could have told me something like all G.I. problems are connected why dont we start by treating your stomach, instead of having a power trip with a patient who was asking questions only because her body was feeling super uncomfortable and she just wanted to find out what is wrong and fix it!!!! What a pity, I thought I found a charming and caring doctor in the beginning. \n\nThe procedure itself was really smoothly done. I felt the anesthesia going into the IV and 2 counts later I passed out. When I woke up, everything was done! It was like a miracle. It just cost a lot of money and I'm not sure if it was necessary in my case.
2;I was a bit skeptical after reading other reviews.  I did not find the restaurant filthy as many others had mentioned.  I had the haddock fish dinner.  It came with fries, cole slaw and a side of vegetables.  The fish was hot and tasty.  We all had pie for dessert.  My son who ordered the apple pie said it tasted homemade and the apples were cooked soft like they should be.  I had the chocolate cream which was very good but I don't like merengue and I find it strange to put that on chocolate cream pie.  All in all, it was a good experience.  The waiter could have been a bit more attentive.
0;It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from.

1;I would given Jackson Java 5 stars 2 months ago, but today I'm only giving 2 stars purely on their coffee.  Great selection of coffee and can't go wrong with Noel.  \n\nLately there has been an influx in some great staff members leaving and a very large rotation of new people.  I really enjoyed going somewhere where the staff already knew what I wanted.  Now I can't even count on the place being open.  Showed up one morning and they weren't even open.  I really hope they can pull it together.
2;I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though.
4;"Excellent!  Love this place. My former \""go-to\"" place was La Scala.  However if you want a special meal, try Ferraro's.\n\na. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.\n\nb.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.\n\nc.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.\n\nd.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.\n\ne.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu. \n\nI love coming here and will continue as the food and service are great."
4;"I don't know what else to add that hasn't already been covered.  This made-to-order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience.  Watching the Ice Pan folks slap your (non)dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show.  Of course, all the while you're watching, you're wishing that the process would just hurry-up-a-bit-because-you-really-want-your-dessert!\n\nChoose from your choice of dairy milk or non-dairy milk, then select your choice of flavour, then decide upon the topping(s).  No preservatives or additives (except what may be in the toppings -- Oreos, Reese pb cups, etc.) and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes.  (I timed it.)  \n\nIt's too bad that one has to fight through the Harrah's smoky casino to get to Ice Pan, but it's worth it.  Be prepared to wait a while; we checked out Ice Pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue, it still took about 15 minutes for the Ice Pan folks to start our order.  We forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though.  :)"
1;View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful.
2;This was my first stop upon landing in Vegas and I must say I think I hit the jackpot!  I enjoy Thai food and when at home I have my usual spots that I frequent when I need a Thai fix.  Visiting las Vegas always excites me not fprthe shows or the casinos or the nightlife mostly because of the diverse and unique dining experiences.  This was my first visit and It will not be my last.  Upon entry my eyes were treated to a visual feast of traditional Thai artwork and decor great attention was paid to detail and it showed throughout the dining room. The server was extremely friendly and gracious.  I ordered my go-to dish of yellow curry with chicken and rice. The flavors in this dish were all beautifully represented from the tender juicy white meat to the Milky spicy curry even the potatoes were perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth. I ordered a signature cocktail, the PP tea the cocktail was nothing special and frankly light on the liquor and heavy on the mixers. The bar took about 25min to prepare our drink, we were almost done with our meal when the drinks arrived. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance I will return to try other dishes on the menu in the near future.
0;Bad service,this place is in need of a manager,someone who understands the business enough to know just because hipsters eat her doesn't mean we need an all hipster crew cooking the food and the most brain dead population of hipsters waiting the tables,also tell the bartender to stop yelling at her employees,it looked like she was going to kill this kid,sad as I was to see this, I was more than happy to walk out......but not after our waitress forgot we were there,dumb bitch
1;"This is a small, quirky, family-run restaurant.   Maybe we went at a bad day, but they had real problems.\n\nService was way slow and confusing.   Other reviewers say this, and this does not rate 2 stars.     We got an appetizer plate that came with two small crackers, I asked for a couple more crackers it took like 10 minutes no kidding.    Bottom line is that they are stretched thin and very disorganized.  \n\nA couple of the dishes were terrible.  We got a three kinds of baked casseroles (you have to order in advance).   One was some kind of tomato cream dish way too sweet and salty.  The other was some kind of potato fish bake, greasy, again way salty, and had bad fish smell.  Keep in mind that I like sardines, anchovies etc and that I like salty food.\n\nWe had a large party and asked for a few extra plates, were told there was usually a 4 dollar \""plate fee\"" to cover dish washing cost.  Huh?\n\nAtmosphere:  I usually don't care about atmosphere and I realize they had to rent a strip mall place, but too loud.   The eating area is small and has hard surfaces, and they had a boom box playing pop music.   Basically everyone had to talk louder, which echoed, which made everyone talk louder.    \n\nWe did get a few good items and I wish them the best of luck.   My advice to owners:\n\nSimplify your menu, figure out popular dishes that you do well and cut out most of the rest, then try to organize your operation.   The biggest problem with small restaurants is sometimes trying to do too much.\n\nSecondly cut the boom box.   Don't copy the worst of chain restaurants by providing \""free\"" music, at least until you get better acoustics.\n\nI don't own restaurant and if I did it would certainly fail, so take my advice for what it is worth.   This restaurant will be moving to new, larger location and if they don't prepare the problems could get much much worse.   Current staff and organization with bigger place would be disaster.\n\nGood luck, would like to come back."
1;I went here last year, and although I got a larger refund than I expected, I thought the $160 they charged me for a relatively simple return was excessive! (I'm single female, with grown children, not a homeowner...seriously how easier could it be.) I won't go back this year.
0;This was the worst experience ever.  soggy french toast.  I asked for a smoothie... then I watched from the table as he made an ice cream shake... which is not a smoothie.  A smoothie has fruit, he replaced the fruit with mango ice cream.  People are not stupid and we know when we are being lied to and it is obvious when a low class restaurant owner tries to pull the wool over our eyes and charge top dollar for it.   No salt and pepper on the tables.  bare bones for high dollar.  Very upset.  Took forever to get a coffee too... Can't believe there are any good reviews here.  It was obvious the owner/manager/whatever was trying to make everyone feel good by working his personality, but service sucked horribly.
2;I have had a Chinese food craving so I have been going for the lunch specials about twice a week.  I decided that I am going to go up and down Spring Mountain to check out all of the Chinese food places.\n\nMy first stop was Cafe Noodle, I didn't hear anything about this place until I walked through the door.  I went in originally to get some good noodles, but their noodle dishes seemed standard for a Chinese restaurant so I decided to do the lunch special.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao squid, above everything else it was FRESH.  It tasted like they prepared it while I was waiting.  The special comes with some rice, a spring roll and a won ton.  The rice, spring roll and won ton were more then less forgettable.  For 6 bucks though the deal was good and the food filling.  If you eat there I believe you get soup and tea.\n\nI have been there twice since the first time and judging on the quality of food I will be back again.
2;This was my second time here, the first time I had it, the cheeseburger was sooooo good, but this time it wasn't so great.
1;I come from a turkic background and I look the part so naturally I was greeted in Turkish by the owner (i think?). I'm thinking ok this is going to be a great place, very authentic.\n\nBoy oh boy was I wrong! \n\nMom had the lab kewab, and I had the chicken. Priced very reasonably but I would have been willing to pay a bit more if that means that they can produce a high quality product. Mom said her meat was chewy and hard. I tried a piece and I agreed. My chicken was bland and had a weird texture. \n\nThe rice which is usually so so tasty at middle eastern/turkish restaurants was so lackluster. Sorry Husnus but this food was not authentic in any way.
3;It's nice to have this place close to Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian to load up on those essentials like snacks, water and sunscreen!\n\nAnother plus - it's clean and new.
4;The AYCE sushi here is the best in Las Vegas. When I go there with a plus one, I usually leave feeling super full, happy, and out like $70 MAX. It is so incredibly worth it that you'll want to make plans for your next outing to Yama. \n\nSon of the Beach, the roll, rocks my socks. It's delicious. So delicious, even, that if you live far away, you need to drive there just for that. I do, and I'm a ways out. Not only that, but the place itself is cool, too. It's kinda cramped on the busier days, but it doesn't detract from it one bit. The waitresses were super nice, quick, friendly, and helpful when I asked my really lame questions. The sushi chefs were also super nice and friendly, and they provided a ton of suggestions when I told them what I was kinda looking for. \n\nSeriously, I'm hungry now just because of writing this review. I'll see you at Yama.
4;My golly I had such a good time here. The entertainment is top-notch, hysterical and definitely worth the $5 cover. The drinks are cheap and never ending. There is plenty of seating (but it's still super packed). Houses a diverse crowd of people, and everyone seems to have a great time. They only play well-known jams, so don't drop any money if you wanna hear something eclectic like my buddy did. Otherwise sip a few and sing something reminiscent with your pals.
0;Ran into this place after no. 1 Boba was closed just to get some milk tea boba. Let's just say I will never go back to this place. The service was terrible the guy at the register was not very friendly and was rude to me. It's a shame because the boba was good and at a decent price but because of the way I was treated I will never come back here.
4;love this place!!!!
1;This place was alright. We came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was semi-full but there was a lot of people waiting on to-go orders. I pictured this place more bar and less restaurant. It was the opposite. \nthey had several TV's and my pet-peeve. NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place? \nOMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. \nWe ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. \nmy bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? \nsorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat. \n\nWINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing.
1;I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon! I will give this place another try if I have another coupon.  08/24/2013 Update - I have yet to return.
4;Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.
3;Found an awesome Groupon deal for this place. $12 for $25 worth of food. Yay! It's located a few blocks from the strip, but very close to my hotel the Hard Rock. \n\nGets very busy during lunch time, you might have to sit at the bar if you can't wait. We ended up sitting at the bar because they told us it would be a 45min wait. The bartender/waitress was very nice and we had a good conversation with out about Vegas/touring etc. \n\nThis place is a lot like The Counter (in bay area CA). You make your own burgers. Different from the Counter, you can specify how you want the patty cooked. Overall, my burger was ok. It was very huge though and I had a hard time putting it in my mouth (that's what she said). Lots of mushrooms! The sweet potato fries are served with honey mustard and they're great. \n\nThey've got a great 2 for 1 deal through Yelp. Stop on by if you're hungry.
2;Everytime I come here, something is up with the service..\n\nWe came in with a bogo entree coupon for breakfast and the lady said it's only valid if we ordered two drinks along with the entrees, so we did. We ordered an Arnold Palmer and coffee with our entrees (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oL9NfHwn_U9EF81H5TYe3Q/l.jpg, http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PwVbCmvVsMRma5j5jBGVrQ/l.jpg). Come to find out, the entrees COME WITH drinks. I was pretty pissed when the lady brought out all our drinks:http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TxahazJeRnCWYERTNKgScA/l.jpg. Isn't that just ridiculous? It was just stupid and I'm annoyed with the waitress for not warning us about that. We basically didn't get anything for free and we just wasted a couple drinks. I will say that I had no complaints with the food, but the whole drink situation just really bothered me. The only plus side from our visit here were the free muffins we got from doing the telephone survey located on the receipt we got.
1;The Mirage is OK but this review is more about their gym, or lack thereof.\n\nHow can you have a resort hotel this size, with massive conference facilities, and have a gym that's so tiny?  The gym consists of 6 treadmills, 5 stairclimbers, and 5 cross trainers.  And 2 of the machines were broken.\n\nAnd there was a line out the door.  Sooooo lame!
3;Quick pointers for the drivers-\nThe best Pastor. Cheap Prices, Open till around 10 and Very Friendly family. \n\nSo lately Ive been on a tear for good Pastor in Vegas. Im on a burrito a day. Im pretty much the mexican Jared. (Yared?)...Anyway I ordered a Pastor burrito here and the woman was very excited to tell me that this was indeed special pastor, and that if I was actually ordering it on purpose, and not just another gringo who got lost outside of Wal Mart, then I would be very impressed. I explained I am a very appreciative eater and had an eye for Pastor since I was from California...They asked and when I did not say LA they were dissapointed, which saddened me and lowered my expectations a bit.  \nThe woman was very friendly, but it was so quiet in there, and her being the talkative type, I decided to wait in my car. I never like to chill staring at the spanish programming, while someone slaves away on my 6 dollar purchase. Ultimately, I think this helped. \nThe Pastor was indeed amazing. Its chopped small, roasted and then grilled for a crispy texture. The seasoning is top notch, and not coincidentally I assume, it tasted exactly like the only other Pastor I have seen cooked like this. A place in Santa Cruz called Tacos Morenos, whose own legend can be heard on the wind of a warm October night. \nUnlike morenos, who uses pintos and a thin layer of melted cheese on the burrito, this one contained rice and refried beans. Pretty bland. What saved the day was the salsa. its got a major kick, but more to your brow than your tongue. So consumption can continue :) \n\nBottom line: They were very friendly and I say the Pastor is a MUST try. If you are simple, get the soft tacos, dont forget the salsa and if you like, remember to let em know.
3;"About three weeks ago the Greek gods decided to take a break from their endless squabbling, descend from Mt. Olympus, and pay a visit to us mortals. Fortunately they landed in Phoenix, and they came bearing gifts. These can be sampled at Athena Greek Cuisine, a new restaurant in the shopping center at Mayo and Scottsdale Rd.\n\n     If the Scordalia ($6) isn't heaven sent, I don't know what is. This spread, made from bread, almonds, potato, olive oil, white wine vinegar and GARLIC is jaw-droppingly good. It has a mellow, almost sweet taste and is good smeared on anything, but especially on the Greek Sausage appetizer ($7), another gift. In fact, all the appetizers we had were delicious. Ken chose Grilled Octopus ($12); Pat had Greek Style Wings ($9), which had been marinated in olive oil, parsley, oregano and lemon (these were even better cold the next day). Marinated Beets ($7) were refreshing. Meg, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for introducing us to Athena, says the Fried Smelts ($7) are tasty too. It's so nice to have out-of-the-ordinary menu selections available. And the servings are surprisingly large, great for sharing.\n\n     The entrees don't reach the sublime level of the appetizers, but for the most part they were good and reasonably priced. Meg and I split Moussaka ($13). It was as good as any I've had in Phoenix, but there was nothing to lift it out of the ordinary. Stewed green beans were served with all the entrees, and these were a nice foil for the richness of the moussaka. Ken had the Combination Plate ($15) which had Pastitsio, Moussaka, Dolmades with Avgolemono Sauce, and Roasted Leg of Lamb. I thought the lamb was \novercooked (but that seems to be the norm for Greek restaurants) and tasted curiously liver-y. Pat was disappointed with her Greek Spaghetti ($12) which was way too salty.\n\n     We were quite full, but Pat, being half Greek, felt we had to sample the Galaktoboureko, a filo and custard concoction. The custard was pasty, rather than\nsilky, and the lemon sauce needed some zest to wake it up. But it was nice to see something besides Baklava on the menu (in fact there were a number of Greek desserts). \n\n     I loved Athena's decor. It's happily over the top. There's a statue of Athena centered in the doorway, an aqua back-lit frieze on one wall, a white bar framed with Greek columns. The white painted wooden chairs (which Ken said were not very comfortable) look great against the dark floor. The only jarring note is the two TV screens flanking the bar. If you go on Athena's website you can get a virtual tour of the restaurant, and also check out the menu. \n\n     Our waiter Chris and his \""shadow\"" were both very pleasant and seemed familiar with the menu. There was a huge amount of staff for the number of patrons, but better too many than too few. Given that Athena has been open only for a short time, I find it easy to overlook the shortcomings - in fact we're planning to return this weekend. We'll probably stick to the appetizers, but believe me, that's no sacrifice!"
3;I recently started working in this area and discovered Aj's! I had heard rave reviews from friends but I had never been to an Aj's myself. I am very impressed. I have been stopping by every couple of days to try out the salad bar and soup options. They also have an amazing selection of craft beers that I scoped out today. I have not shopped here yet for other grocery items but it looks like they have a great selection of healthy foods and harder to find local items. \n\nThe bakery is also very nice and has a good selection of bagels, pastries, brownies and cupcakes. I ordered a green chile bagel here the other day for lunch which was delicious. The berry acai tea is also wonderful. Really I have not found anything bad about this place so far. The service has also been great on every visit. Top notch. I will be back.
2;Three stars for kabuki. \n\nFood: 5 stars- Excellent rolls , and i must recommend the sunkist roll's , which are specialty rolls. They are California rolls with raw tuna over the top and some sort of delicious sauce. Also, the Philly rolls are amazing. They also give you edamame beans, which are tasty ! \n\nPrice: 4  stars - So, in comparison to likes of Ra sushi, Kabuki's price's are amazing. Regular rolls are 4-6 dollars for 6-8 rolls and around 9 dollars for 6 specialty rolls. \n\nAtmosphere: 4 stars- The restaurant is decorated in a modern, and artistic fashion. \n\nService: 2 stars- The servers at Kabuki are not attentive what so ever, once they get your order it seems like simply forever until you finally receive your food. Once, you finally do they will not give you the time of day from there on out. In fact, one time our server completely deserted us and a different server came and brought us our check. They never even asked how the food was. They spend more time talking to each other then tending to the customers.
2;We stopped here for lunch because we were tired and didn't feel like walking any further. We both had the potato leek soup, which was excellent. My Sweetie had the tuna sandwich with fries and I had the plain salad with a side of fries. I was sad my salad had a more than a few not-so-fresh leaves, but the waitress (Dana) did not charge us for it. The fries were crispy and hot and tasty. The food was good but not memorable in anyway. Dana was one of the sweetest waitresses ever. So polite and attentive.
4;Not badly priced...got a rate of $150 on a Sunday of a busy weekend and $120 the following Monday morning when we decided to stay an extra day!  The room has a Keurig coffee maker, so don't forget to pack some coffee pods.  The robes are super comfortable - as are the fuzzy slippers that are complimentary (take home for a nice souvenir)!  I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a suite in Las Vegas that has a separate bedroom (with door) and living room.  You can use Mandalay Bay's awesome pool as well.  It's only downfalls are that it's on the very end of the strip and the walk/cab ride can get long/expensive and since it's a higher end hotel, all of the restaurants/room service tend to be higher end=expensive!
3;"I went to Dillons planning to have a serious conversation with friends last night, so the food was not  top on the list of my priorities.  In spite of that I was impressed by the food and the service.  I appreciated the fact the server was very knowledgable about was being served.  She also gave some real thought to questions concerning the sauces  and recommendations we asked her to make.  She also kept our drinks flowing moderately including keeping my water glass topped off.  As i don't drink, often times, I end up with a half empty glass which I invariably have to ask to get refilled.  Not so here;  udos to the server.\n\nI had the pulled chicken sandwich which certainly tender enough with a very fresh bun.  The mild sauce was about what our server said it would be.  Next time I will go for something stronger though.  Concerning the goal of the evening, I was going very mild in everything I ate.  The potato salad had a nice flavor but was just a scoop in a little bowl.  One of my pet peeves, it just looked boring.\n\nWhat really surprised me as it would have been the last thing I'd have ever ordered was my friends stew.  The stew was a luscious combination of meat and vegetables.  It almost looked almost like a thick soup.  I like it when something just looks like it would be something I'd really like to have just seeing it. .  My friend said it was as appetizing as it looked.  This is what I will have the next time I go there.\n\nNo problems parking but this was during the middle of the week so don't know about weekends."
3;I have been here probably at least 4x over the past year. I have never had a bad experience yet.  Last night my Aunt was in town visiting.  She was staying on the strip at Treasure Island so we decided to grab some sushi at the Palazzo. \n\nThe Otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! It was the first time I had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!\n\nThey have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant. \n\nThe only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price. However the quality is high! I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.
3;My kids rode on the Zip Line again and had a great time.
1;"Limited beer actually available on tap. Hell, I could slap a sticker on a tap and call it whatever I wanted to, doesn't make it true. Even if they did have all of the beer they claimed, it's still not enough to call it a \""world\"" of beer. Seriously limited in supply and variety. Our group headed up the street to another establishment after only one round and found better selections."
3;The staff is always nice and cheerful, although they can be a bit ignorant. I've received beer poured into the wrong kind of glass and they nearly always mispronounce quinoa. But the vegan tacos are yummy and the laid back atmosphere is relaxing and fun.
0;We ordered to go. Shrimp good, salad great,meat in orange beef was disgusting. Beef skewers disgusting. I'm not really sure it was beef. Not trying to be gross but I have to be honest, they are not using quality products. Never again.
1;As much as I wanted to love this place, being it's in Vegas - it was a total disappointment. I'm a avid supporter of Drybar in LA, so they've definitely set the bar high. \n\nTheir space is okay, ok staff, but my hair was a total fail. I do a better job when I do my own hair. The stylist put far too much product in my hair and it only eneded up looking dirty, after a few hours. The only great part of my experience was getting my hair washed and the mimosa I got to drink while I had my hair done. \n\nI can't wait for Drybar to open their Vegas location. This place is definitely not worth my time or money.
0;Hated it. I can see why some people liked it, but from the moment I walked in I was ready to leave.\n\n1) When I walked in I approached the hostess to ask about the party I was meeting. I didn't even get a chance to speak. She Shoved the card and menu in my face, said some things, and then moved on to the next person. \n\n2) The card system- I don't like having to get up to go get my food. But even beyond that, I hand my card to the person behind the counter who swipes it then goes back to cooking. With all my germs and who knows what else from the floor and other people on his hands. Made me not want to eat.\n\n3) The food- I didn't like my food at all.  I had the verdure pizza, and it just wasn't good. There was very little cheese on it and there were too many large, heavy vegetables for the thin flimsy pizza slices.\n\n4) Layout- They had my party in the front of the restaurant, which meant we had to walk to the back for our food, and keep going to the far corner of the restaurant for our drinks. Inconvenient. They also had us at a table with stools, which was extremely inconvenient because the stools were so tall and many of us were so short.\n\nI won't be going back.
2;this was my first visit to pei wei and i enjoyed it but felt it was just ok. i had the japanese chili ramen with tofu and a veggie spring roll. the spring roll was fairly bland and greasy. the ramen was good and i've got leftovers for tomorrow. honestly, i'd rather go to yc's if i want bbq but i'll probably try it again and actually get a meat dish
3;Very helpful about gluten free needs. At the beginning of the buffet, a chef walked me through all the items and what was gluten free. He also made me a special gluten free stir fry from the Asian station that was very yummy! \n\nIn general there is a good selection of food. High end items include prime rib and crab legs, if they had stuff like oysters would be perfect. \n\nThe sushi was not very good. Otherwise good spread.
4;I ate here with my family more times than I can count when I was growing up.  It's also one of the go-to spots when my friends from high school want to get together.  This is a quintessential neighborhood pizza restaurant and bar.  They have a good selection of craft beers, including ones from Four Peaks and Stone brewing on tap.  The tortellini toss salad is absolutely to die for, especially when you drown it in their homemade Italian dressing.  The dressing is thick and has a hint of tomato goodness.  I always order the enchilada pizza- black beans, green chili, grilled chicken with a side of sour cream, guac, diced red onions and lettuce.  I load all that stuff on top of the pizza and it is a divine pie.
4;2nd visit review.--- decided to give this place a second chance.   I am glad I did!!  Service was 5 starts for sure!  Nathan was our server and he was amazing.  Checked on us frequently and or drinks were always full.   The food was also good...\n\nWe order the fondue again,  cheese was amazing this time.  Zucchini fritters with aioli were very good.  Burger had good flavor and fries were great.  Lastly the carnitas were also very tasty.   \n\nI was hesitant to come here again after my last experience,  but the second time was amazing!  We will come back here again for sure!
3;"They served my iced chai in a glass.  Like, an actual glass glass.  You don't get those these days (what, am I like 80??). \n\nIn the ye olden days of my life I was a Bucks Barista.  We USED to serve iced drinks in a real glass.  This was back in the day when the Bucks had a \""small\"" coffee house vibe.  Gone are those days!  Come to think of it, do they even offer \""for here\"" mugs for hot drinks anymore??  It's such a nice REAL coffee house perk to have that option!\n\nThere's plenty of room to work for the day and the Internet is FREE!  Major perk!  The Barista here was also extremely nice and helpful when I asked her what kind of chai they served.  She didn't groan when I asked, like some jaded B's do.  It was an organic brand I had never heard of before and it was great!  Not too sugary and just the right amount of spice (forgive me for not remembering the brand!).  \n\nI was STARVING too with no lunch and noticed they carried Sustainable Rustic Bakery goods.  The B told me they are located in the Pittsburgh Public Market as well.  I picked up what looked like a massive size fig newton.  It was incredible!!  And made me feel much better about myself knowing that the ingredients are all natural.  Maybe not the best lunch option, but it was awesome....I'll def be hitting them up at PPM!\n\n\nTotal plus: Rockin' tunes...I totes dig the vibe!"
2;I stood in a long, hot line at Curdfest to try the Curd Girl curds for a second time. I had high hopes after my initial so-so experience, however, I was again let down.  The curds were hot and gooey, but the taste was just bland.  The strawberry rhubarb sauce was good, but the two favors didn't complement each other as much as I'd hoped. The girls that run it are so sweet, and I really wish I liked the curds more. But, I've been underwhelmed twice now.  I'm sticking with my three star rating.
2;"I used a groupon today for this place.  I was unimpressed; the food seemed good, but the service sucked.  We rarely saw our server.  My husband and my sign of a crappy serve place is when his glass is empty.  His glass was empty for a while.  I had to give our credit card to another person because we sat there with our check for ten minutes and our server was no where in site.  AND the place was not busy.  At most, there was six other tables in the dinning area that were occupied.\n\nNot interested in returning.  Rather go to a place that has better service!"
0;Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back.
3;I dig this place.\n\nPerfect location right in the middle of the strip. \nLeast amount of walking from your room to gambling.\nFriendly staff (always willing to help, quick and strong with the drinks, talkative dealers)\nClean rooms with flat screens.  \nCheap.\nFat Elvis.\n\nSure, it's no mega resort.  Sure the gambling floor is small and the restaurants aren't the best.  But, it's one of the hidden gems of the strip that will surely be gone in a few years.  \n\nEnjoy it while you can.
0;Do NOT order from Palm Pizza.\n\nI ordered lunch through Eat24 with Palm Pizza and was quoted 45-60 minutes. After 75 minutes Eat24 called the restaurant and they were told that the driver had ALREADY LEFT and was en route to my office. 45 minutes later I had still not received the food so I reached out to Eat24 and they contacted Palm Pizza. They were informed that the restaurant had lost my order... TWICE and that they could have it to me in another 45-60 minutes!\n\nNeedless to say I declined their offer, Eat24 issued a full refund and and encouraged Eat24 to cancel their contract with Palm Pizza since their customer service is so grossly substandard.\n\nRidiculous...
4;Great place. I was looking for a steak restaurant to take my mom to on mothers day, because she was in town for my graduation from CA. I wanted something classy, that was not full of families (aka - small kids) but not too fancy. Don and Charlie's was perfect. Just the right combination of class, style, and tastefulness. Not so quiet that it's awkward, but not too loud that it's annoying. I had the 16 oz New York strip  George Will's style (garlic on top) and it was absolutely amazing. The sports memorabilia is really cool too. I recommend this place to anyone.
4;Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!
0;UPDATE  - 8/27/2014\n\nNews FLASH - There is now a LIFE TIME WARRANTY on the GAS TANK. But you have to take your Magnum to the dealer for a day. Then they say YUP!  You need a new gas tank. WOW!  When will I get the new gas tank ? Well see we have a small problem the gas tanks are on NATIONAL BACK ORDER and it could be another year until we get them.... Love Always Dodge!  You have to laugh right or you'll explode...\n\n2006 SRT8 MAGNUM GAS TANK IS DEFECTIVE when you fill up your gas tank the vehicle will stall out.  Fill it 3/4 only until you get a new gas tank from Dodge, If ever.  Lets hope the recall comes soon.  Here is the weblink\nwww-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/Ve... \n\n2013 Federal probe covers more than 192,000 Chrysler 300C luxury cars, Dodge Charger muscle cars and Dodge Magnum wagons from the 2006 model year. The cars have 5.7-liter or 6.1-liter V-8 engines. GOOD LUCK!  I hope this HELPS someone.\n\nCome on!  Really ? I took my 2006 Magnum SRT8 in 10/2/2012  for a ETC red light on my dash.  ( Electronic Throttle Control ) The service advisor calls me and says your rims and tires are the wrong size too small. I said what are you saying. HELLO!  They are stock rims and tires 20's.  He says let me call you back. I said ok maybe he had the wrong vehicle. People make mistakes right? Nope! Ring Ring Hello!  The Master Mechanic was looking at the ESP traction and not the ETC he's really fast so he didn't read and or see the real issue. OH JOY!  So what s the solution?  Well we don't see any alerts in the PCM - ( powertrain control module ).  Seems it was set for small rim and tire size. You should be fine now we reset the PCM to the correct setting. OH REALLY!  What a complete waste of time - I should just fixed it myself.   Note*  I did pay for a transmission and rear differential flush.  I will never return to this dealership ever.
3;Try the Devil Dog. It's to die for. Potato chips, egg salad, Tabasco, scallions-need I say more? Also, the fries are out of this world. I try to avoid this place as much as possible because I tend to try to avoid things such as hotdogs and French fries, but it is pretty irresistible. The hotdogs are made fresh and are all-natural, so that makes them almost healthy, right?\n\nYou can out of here for about $15 for two. That's pretty fantastic. \n\nThey also have a Vegan option. So all you vegans out there, go have a hotdog!
1;Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it.
2;"This place came highly recommended from a co-worker but we ended up being disappointed. We showed up at 6:45 and they were already cleaning the grill for the night.. not sure when they close, but we probably should have taken it as a sign and kept walking. \n\nBecause it was \""late\"" we could only get sandwiches.. no fries, etc. Luckily you get to eat in a gas station, sooo you do have a great selection of chips.. whoo. The steaks were just OK. At $6.95 for a small, they are a tad pricey and honestly I think capriottis makes a better steak. Skip this one."
4;One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.
3;"Wow it really took me this long to actually try Liberty Market, really!?!?!? What was I thinking! I have been missing out on this place for way too long. And to find it now, just when my company is moving and it was sooo close!!!!\n\nOk, sorry enough of my whining! This place is just WOW! The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good! And the taste did not disappoint either.\n\nMy friend and I went to lunch today at Liberty Market, I was at first surprised by the line to order, it was LONG! But the way they seat people is really ingenious; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting. Pretty cool!\n\nWe ordered the Picnic Sandwich, which was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crisp green apples, which added great texture. A little blue cheese, some turkey, it was really well put together.\n\nWe also ordered the White pizza, which was very tasty! The crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition. Oh and don't forget dessert, no I really mean it, DON'T forget dessert....well I guess you can if you are on a diet or something. We had the Red Velvet Cake, YUM!\n\nI think Liberty Market really has taken the cafeteria style dining and made it a well-organized machine; I am so impressed by this place. What took me so long to get here, I ask myself again!"
1;Good for only one visit.  Very overpriced
2;I am originally from NYC, where the Chinese food reigns supreme... and when I moved out here it was hard to find anything that was even remotely close to good.... While China Red is still not NYC amazing Chinese food, it definitely comes close. The portions are nice and big, the flavors are great, and the egg drop soup is fab! They offer lunch specials, which are hard to beat since the price is about $6 for 2 meals worth food :) PLUS, they deliver, which is hard to find out here in AZ!
4;Amazing....hyper clean, friendly and very nice overall.  Plenty of relaxation and naked bodies for all.  If you have a naked phobia this might not be the place for you or stay upstairs. I'm a regular especially in the dry salt room!
2;Service was great, with friendly and attentive servers.  We had a party of 3 adults and 3 kids under 10, one a 7 month old. Definitely a kid friendly atmosphere. We went for a late lunch around 3. It was happy hour so drinks and appetizers were 1/2 off.  Calamari was slightly overdone, more brown than golden.  The family size pizza was enough to feed us all.  It had a thin crust, and we got 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 cheese. Both halves were very greasy with oil dripping off.  However, the menu is extensive with sandwiches, burgers, specialty pizzas and pasta, so I wouldn't rule out a return trip.
2;"Whoever built a mall at the corner of 77 and WT Harris Blvd has probably since been fired.  It deserves only two stars, but one extra is being awarded because it is by far the least crowded big mall in or near Charlotte.  It was slow before The Great Recession, and is still slow.  No longer can the recession be blamed for lack of business because if I go to Carolina Place, South park, or Concord Mills, I can't find a parking spot on the weekend.  This mall isn't even busy at Christmas time!  I think they may have been banking on 485 opening to the mall - which it did 3 years ago, but that hasn't helped business either.\n\nIt has your typical stores, most of which it shares with Carolina Place, and an AMC Theater which is only accessible from outside the mall (very odd for a mall theatre).  The food court is typical as is the mandatory Starbucks.  I do like that the main restrooms near the food court have waterless urinals - those things are awesome.\n\nThere also some decent restaurants like Bravo's but I generally don't go to a mall to go to restaurant.  The anchor stores are oddly placed - like Dillard's at the far end of the mall.  Most Dillard's are slow, so they don't need anything to hinder their business (hint - if you can't find a place to park at a mall and it has a Dillard's, there will usually be places to park).  \n\nThe mall also a cool \""man zone\"" type place.  They have a couple of TVs with sports so you can watch tv while the significant other shops.  \n\nNorthlake isn't too bad for being a mall, but it's average at best."
0;My family and I were there on Tuesday (December 30, 2014) and just wanted to let you know that the food was excellent and Yvette was an amazing server. We were a party of 12 and do understand that it might be difficult to accommodate at times. The hostess (I think her name is Dylan -- long blonde hair) was not the most pleasant. For someone who works the hostess desk, her attitude and demeanor are not the best first impression of your establishment. Sad to say, she was just plain rude. We understand that she can't sit our party right away until everyone got there, but she could have informed us that in a polite manner.  I work in healthcare and deal with people as well. From my experience, one unpleasant interaction impacts an individual's overall perception of that experience. I just want to say that it might be a good idea for Dylan to go through a customer service class to better her interactions with your clients. Thank you so much.
1;We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down.
0;I have to say that these guys really had me fooled. The apparent owner talks and the other guy that has all of the GM experience tries to make things work,unfortunately it doesn't. When they tell you about all of the GM experience be wary.  They took more than 4 weeks to fix things that I am now having to redo. I am now wondering what they actually did. Check with the Better Business Bureau before you give them your business. Don't let them talk you into a big job. If you are not a mechanic you will never know if the work has been done or not,especially if only a year or so later you end up,,, wash,rinse, repeat?
0;This place was extremely disappointing! \n\nAfter having some amazing fish tacos in SD, I wanted to find something here that would hold me over until my next trip. \nAfter reading the reviews for this place, I was sure this was going to be my spot. Oh how wrong I was! \n\nI got the shark and mahi mahi taco special with horchata. My friends got the white fish taco plate with that nasty ass red drink. \n\nEverything tasted so awful. I didn't even finish one of my tacos because I was so disgusted by it. My friends finished theirs but that's just because they were hungry. Afterwards, we all got sick from the food. \n\nYuck, even thinking about it makes me want to vomit.
4;Dr. Noggle is the best!! She's the only one I allow to touch my back. Great customer service and very personalized. I would recommend this going here to anyone!!
0;"I would give this place zero stars if I could. They have horrible customer service - my husband and I came to try this place; we were really looking forward to it based on the reviews. Well, as soon as we arrived, they attempted to seat us and asked if we were doing the AYCE. We said yes, and asked about the prices. The waitress said it was $22/person, but it would be an additional $9.99 for our two year old to join us. (Which is the same price as an eight year old.)  WTH? You're gonna charge $9.99 for a two year old when kids this young are usually free? Toddlers hardly eat anything and mine sure as hell doesn't eat seafood. You've gotta be kidding me. The waitress just kept pointing to the menu and repeating, \""$9.99\"" If that's how your restaurant makes your money, you're doing something wrong. PASS ON THIS SCAMMY PLACE!"
4;The lobster fajitas were amazing! $26. After reading the reviews about the service I was hesitant to try this place but our waiter Fab was awesome!  I'll be back to order the same & ask for Fab
1;First of all it was fun !  But the people they hired to work for them are jerks !  Pushy- RUDE oh did I mention RUDE !
1;This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner.
0;"Brought a perfectly healthy pet in for a comprehensive exam and dental cleaning. We brought her home nearly 12 hours after our drop off and she has not been well ever since. The vet was not terribly kind, brusque really in her follow up care. I was told there \""wasn't really a place for her (our dog), but the doctor will make time\"" when we asked to bring her in to be seen after a long night of throwing up and retching/coughing. Her post-procedure vomiting and dehydration were addressed well enough the day following, but no real recovery to the same health despite our continued efforts at home. Later in the week, with vomiting and inability to keep food down a problem, asked to come back in. Only this time, I requested fees to be waived as these issues were caused by her dental treatment earlier in the week. I was told by an otherwise very kind front office rep. that she would call me back. Nothing. No call back. No concern for my pet who was made ill through their care. Had they at least called back with an estimate of costs that would have been nice. Is it so bad to ask for costs to be waived or reduced for care that is needed to correct problems that the same vet created? \n\nInstead I called our pet's former vet (who had left Banfield last year--should tell you something) and she received excellent supportive care with instructions and supplies to continue her care at home. Our dog is still not well, but at least we have the tools to help her and the confidence that our new vet actually cares about her well-being. \n\nWhen we picked up our pet the day of her teeth cleaning she looked awful--bile and drool on her face and paws, what appeared to be excrement on her tail end, and watery, weeping eyes. We were told that she had gotten sick after her wakeup from anesthesia, however the state she was in was inexcusable. This office needs to pay more focused attention to their clients instead of treating them like they are on an assembly line. We will no longer be visiting this facility and discourage anyone from bringing their furry loved ones here."
2;I had heard soooo much about Body English I was a bit nervous it wouldn't live up to the hype.  It didn't.  \n \nTwo years ago when my husband and I were in Vegas we didn't really understand how the clubs worked.  So we made a feeble attempt to go to Body English....we waited in line for an hour (the first, last, and only time I've ever waited in a line for a club....) until we just decided to drink and gamble in the Hard Rock.  2 years later we are much older and wiser.  And better connected.   I gave my host a call who put us on the guest list.  Because we listen to everything she tells us to do we got there at 10:30 right when it was opening.  I was the first one in the club that evening.  The bouncer looked at everyone else and decided on us.  This is why I love my host.  The bouncer was even nice enough to comp us the admission price so we were the first to be let in with no waiting and no cover.  Just how I like it. \n \nUnfortunately, that is really where the fun ends.  Body English is really just one room.  There isn't much done to make it aesthically pleasing either.  The music was awful.  AWFUL.  I love Common, don't get me wrong, but a nightclub isn't the place.  I also wasn't impressed that they were relaxing their dress code policy and people were coming in and tshirts and sneakers.  If you're going to have a strict policy make it strict and keep it strict.  I was so underwhelmed.  I think it is just too clubby for me.....I'm more of an ultra lounge kind of gal.
4;Hate going to the dentist... This place has been awesome though! Everyone is extra friendly and polite!! They all take time to explain things fully. No shadiness. Helpful payment plans too!
3;Efficient staff with even measured decorum. I had two eggs with creton and baked beans. Odd, their creton is served in a market-wrapped portion. Probably accessible in grocery stores soon. All elements of the meal we're fine. My wife had the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was rather sweet but still pleasant. Really folks, a good breakfast place but without the charm of a 'mom & pop' intangibles.
4;Great Stay! We stayed here one night due to the close proximity to the Convention Center, we then moved to the Bellagio, and immediately moved back to Embassy Suites.\nWhat a wonderful experience. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. \nHaving the option of an evening cocktail at the Manager's special is a nice benefit, and the breakfast each morning was steaming hot and fresh, making it so convienent when needing to get to an event at the Convention Hall.\nThe workout room was clean, equipment is updated and it is included with your stay. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the wireless internet is provided at no charge, a nice added benefit. The hotel was quiet and clean. You don't have to schlepp your luggage for miles into the hotel, parking is plentiful and free. \nWe didn't mind being off the strip, it was a welcome respite from the craziness. You can easily drive to the strip, or walk to the monorail station for an evening of fun.\nWhen in Vegas again, the Embassy Suites gets my business!
0;The Skinny: Encountered rude staff. \n\nThe Fat: Pit stop, the mall seemed decent but because it's also Arizona, they get a one star anyway. I absolutely hate dealing with rude staff.
2;Went there to ask for prices. The girl at the front desk was very nice but seemed shy and not so confident. I know you just recently opened, but please be more confident and have your prices straight. Even if you have deals going on, it might help if you a have your regular prices listed. I was just very confused with what she was telling me. I also told her we have a black lab and she didn't seem to know what kind of a dog that was. Please do some research about different dog breeds, at least the most common ones. In a pet grooming business this is the least of knowledge you should have. I wish you best of luck with the business and I will update my review after actually using their services.
1;"My coworkers and I have been at this venue several times but somehow a change of staff has taken place recently.  With this change, we had the worst service ever.  First, the server took forever to take our order.  Finally she took our drink order and after she brought it over, we asked for straws and artificial sweetener.  She never came back and finally one of us got up to get it and she was clueless and didn't care.  Then she took our order, made recommendations but she served this first.  They were wings, and it was cold and not as tasty as expected.  Our food took 45 minutes to arrive, (pizza and green salad), she messed up on the pizza.  Prior to serving, she forgot our orders, had to ask again what we ordered (perhaps if she wrote the orders down??).  She had an attitude and had this \""I Don't Care\"" look.  Needless to say, we have not been back to Streets of New York because the service was awful, server was rude rude rude..."
3;Dear Sprinkles tempatation, \n\nMy jeans are in a fight with you for your delicious frosting and cupcakes that I can't resist...no matter the level of will power I'm feeling that day. \n\nSprinkles cupcakes are what you expect. They are tasty, they are sugary, they go straight to your tush and they are worth every calorie and the inevitable sugar coma that will follow. \n\nI'm a frosting fanatic. I could probably be fine with just eating the top of the muffin and frosting, but somehow it's impossible to leave part of a Sprinkles cupcake remaining. My favorites flavors are the lemon coconut, anything chocolate, peanut butter...really just any cupcake there. You can't go wrong. \n\nSprinkles cupcakes aren't cheap. We are talking about nearly $4 for a cupcake, but if you're willing to fork out the cash you'll enjoy every bite you take from that fork. They are a great hostess gift if you want to impress and they are perfect for a birthday treat or going away farewell sweet. \n\nSo next time my sugar craving hits, I'll succumb to my will power and say hi to the friendly staff at Sprinkles.
1;"Food was pretty good. The power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 90-95 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable. The manager said \""we can't control Nevada power.\"" Creamed spinach was no good. Lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  The steak just ok."
0;"Half Price, Zero Service!\nI found the store to be alright and surprisingly I DID find something I liked and made a purchase. The staff was very friendly and I was excited about my order. Delivery was promised the next weekend, I was called on the delivery day with the time window for delivery and then 2 hours later, I was called back informed that they in actuality did NOT have my furniture in possession to begin with. \n\nThe person at the store could do absolutely nothing to help me and did not offer any compensation. What is worse, is that though I was promised follow up with a phone call by Monday morning, the call never came. I got in contact with them and was given the run-around about delivery dates and a bunch of EMPTY PROMISES (as mentioned by another reviewer). Two weeks later, I filed a dispute with the bank for my money back. \n\nThis store/\""business\"" is SHADY! Do NOT shop here and do NOT let any of the friendly staff fool you, they are clueless and rats just like the \""boss\"" they work for. Just so you know, their \""ALL SALES ARE FINAL\"" rule is null and void if they do not deliver what/when they say the will deliver. Thank you to the bank for informing me of that. I will peacefully go shop at RC Willy now."
4;Just a shout out for Ginger Luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair! She is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter, Madisson, will let touch her hair.  Thanks for listening and loving what you do! :)
3;Stopped in for lunch today, it was fantastic!  I had the spinach and feta chimi because as a vegetarian I don't find a lot of meat free chimis out there.  This alone will bring me back to this place!  I am also anxious to try their other veg options.  Service was friendly and quick, price was great.  We had 3 entries and a kids meal for about $40 before tip. \n\nSalsa is fantastic, but if you don't like a little zip or are sensitive to spice you might want to skip it.  I loved it though.
0;I came here for my best friend's birthday dinner. She made a reservation for 8pm and we didn't get seated until 9:30pm! We had a fairly large group, about 8 people, and we were just awkwardly standing outside while someone would come outside every 15 minutes to tell us our table was ALMOST ready. After an hour of this nonsense our group was ready to go somewhere else because we were so hungry. However, we decided to wait it out. Apparently we were waiting for people to pay their check and finish their meal. What was the point of making a reservation? \n\nOnce we were seated our food came pretty quickly but our waitress seemed less than enthused. I ordered the salmon roll and spicy crab roll which I would say were pretty decent. I don't eat sushi much but my friend who also attended the dinner and eats sushi said that it was just average. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again.
1;The thing I hate about them is that I can never just get stuff done. They always want to talk to me about more services. One time I took them up on it and it turned out to be the biggest mistake ever. All my accounts were mixed up and I started getting all these service charges. It took over an hour or my time and nothing I was told held up to be true.\n\nAdditionally, during the holidays, there were two fraudulent charges made on my account totalling around $200. I filed a claim, they temporarily credited my account, only to take back their credit without notice, causing my bank account to be overdrawn. They refused to believe me that I did not buy insurance from a company I have no policy with, nor did I purchase prescription drugs from some middle eastern county.\n\nOn the other hand, they have lots of locations.
3;Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments
0;I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.
0;"Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. My mother lives in Summerlin and this is the closest location to her and having her pick it up, I live in Henderson. For my birthday, my mom ordered me a cake as a steady tradition I've upheld since I was 5, specifically for a baskin Robbins cake. My family was all in town and we picked up the cake, and it had no writing on it. The explanation I was given was that \""another person with a similar name, cancelled their cake, and we thought it was this one\"". So much for your professional organization skills. After my mom informs me that she's not able to take it back, I drive all the way back up to my moms in Summerlin to pick up the cake, drive to your location and stand with a melting cake in my hands waiting for it to be fixed. Keep in mind, I called earlier and explained my situation to Cassie, whom of which told me she herself would write what I wanted on the cake. I asked after 10 minutes of waiting if they could put my messed up cake now melted in the freezer. I wish I could put a picture in here because of the way this POS cake looked. The scariest thing of all is that these \""associates\"" who lack courtesy of greeting customers, customer service skills, organizational skills, after seeing how this individual wrote on my cake, WRITING skills, and basic communication between co-workers, these associates were ALONE. Was I offered a free dessert while waiting? No way, these \""children\"" working starred at me when I even asked for what I wanted written on the cake. I am so DISTURBED I was handled in such a way. If I was a parent and I had family FLY IN for a child's birthday, picked up a cake after dinner, took it home and had no writing on it, take it back to have it fixed and be treated in such a way is APPALLING and I would be infuriated, much as I am now. I will never EVER return to this location. I will continue to call the manager until I hear back and I am calling corporate. Train your staff better and take pride in your business, based on your reviews, you clearly have no intention of putting effort and basic customer service into your workplace. Because of this incident, my family left town and my mom works all the time and I ate my birthday cake alone. Thanks guys."
3;"It bothers me just a little that I happen to know who the best piano player is in Las Vegas and that Shaun DeGraff was playing with his band at the Mob Bar. A guy from outside of the \""702\"" shouldn't have this much information, but I do. People have called me \""The Boss\"" before, so maybe it's a bit of syndicate thing. \n\nMob Bar is located about a block from Fremont Street. The bar is pretty much inside  of the newly renovated Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino. As one might expect, there is a swanky mobster feel to the place. We walked in and lady luck snagged us a table near the band. As usual the music was good and our waitess was on top of things. Everyone seemed to be having a great time.  \n\nJust sitting in the classy Mob Bar, it is hard to fathom that you are merely a short block away from the madhouse on Fremont Street. Mob Bar is truly an island in a sea of madness. Mind you, once the music stopped, we relocated to Fremont Street with requisit Tall Boy beers in hand and a buzz that put us on a level playing field with just about everyone else.\n\nMob Bar is a classy little bar that is worth checking out if you're downtown."
0;"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \""sacrificed or as important\"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \""don't wear pants,\"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \""cooler\"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms."
1;As a family - we love pizza, and pasta, and hoagies (and wine and beer).  Yes, these guys are capable of good food - just not consistently.  We've eaten in and out and at various SONY locations but this is one closest to our house and one we have TRIED to order for delivery quite a few times and each time we've been let down.  Tonight's order was, yet again, another let down with cold food, a long time delivery (quoted an hour max and we were wondering if we were going to get our food at the hour 15 mark), a big tab (me, hub and small child) and, well, a disengaged driver.  It is what it is... I fear we are running out of boutique-y pizza places in our area - the big chains aren't great but doggone-it they are consistently hot, timely and meet the expectation.  I love supporting local businesses but I shouldn't have to sacrifice quality for my money... right?  The positive - whatever frozen cake that gets thawed enroute - we enjoyed that.  Pizza, pasta and salad...boo.  Damn.
2;Food. Ok. Beer selection on point. That's why I like the place. Staff. Meh. They seem fake nice, which is unfortunate in Henderson. \n\nMy husband and I went to Millers this evening and they had live music. The dude was fantastic! We enjoyed every minute. But NO ONE, not even the manager, could tell me who he was... How does a venue not know who they booked?! Super bummed to leave and not know who we were listening to. We're local artists who want to support other local artists.
3;So Glad they were open late !! Yum
2;I wouldn't say it's the best chinese around but they are fast, efficient and clean.  They offer a decent lunch specials menu for under $10 and because parking is easy, you can easily get in and out during lunchtime in under 40 minutes (if you want).  The dishes that I have had are cashew shrimp, moo shu vegetables, vegetable lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I was satisfied with all of my choices.  They do offer brown rice make sure you specify that you do not want fried rice.
2;"When our department has to entertain guest speakers or job candidates, The Bread Company always becomes the default dinner/lunch location.  Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:\n\n(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)\n\n(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.\n\n(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \""nice\"" restaurant in the area.)\n\nAll of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.\n\nFor lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.\n\nIn terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera."
1;"I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.\n\n\nYes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.\n\nThere was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.\n\nThe place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.\n\nThe food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.\n\nBut in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \""meh\"" dining experience."
1;Not sure on the cost of this hotel as we are on a company trip but I can't imagine its much. The only positive is its at the center of the strip.\nLots of negatives, no Wifi below the 30th (or something ridiculous like that) the buffet didn't look good and had terribly long lines. As most of Vegas, the hotel smells like smoke. The rooms are not quiet. You can hear your neighbors talking, tv's, phones ringing and toilets flushing. \nUnless it was like $45 per night, I would say it isn't worth it.
3;A nice new store. There are many in the north of the valley, this one is the nicest. Out of the way so never busy. All the great little shops inside and even a Starbucks.
3;What a lovely experience we had. I'm kind of picky with my taste on wine by that was no challenge for this place. When I wasn't fully satisfied I had a new suggestion and it was perfect!! The lobster was to die for and the crab legs are always and always will be my favorite. They even let me custom my own fav dessert. What's yours? Ask them I'm sure they will assist you! \n\nOh ya.. Be sure to request siting outside when you make your reservation. The lake and light show is a trip! :)
0;So I ordered a lean machine from this place and when I left I started to drink it and it tasted like someone put all kinds of medicine in the drink it was so bad it made the hair on my arms and neck stand up and made me get shivers from drinking it. So i mixed it around a little to see if that would help and it didn't at all. I wasted money on that drink cause I had to throw it away due to it being so bad and nasty. I will never order a smoothie from this place again it was so bad and disgusting. It makes me want to throw up. DO NOT ORDER THE LEAN MACHINE FROM THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Stopped in for a pit stop and we ordered wine and a Manhattan. Imagine my surprise to look across the room to see bartender violently shaking a bourbon drink! Yikes. Bourbon should be stirred. The shaking creates a swamp water effect on bourbon. Plus it was served as a martini instead of on ice as the menu described. I suggest they rename the Manhattan a Bruised Bourbon.  \n\nThink I will stick with Barrelhouse for cocktails.
0;Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.
0;"So disappointing. This used to be the BEST sushi place around... Until the new ownership recently. Sushi was terrible... Small... And overpriced. I got a box which had TINY portion sizes. The soup bowl I got was half filled, the beef teriyaki was over cooked and terrible, the vegetable tempura consisted of 3 tiny pieces, and the salad was meh. The new owner supposedly is cutting down on portion sizes, which is quite obvious, but she is not cutting down on price. That, to me, is greedy and I don't think a good way to run a business. Although the owner was \""nice\"", a few of her comments rubbed me the wrong way and her lack of attentiveness was ridiculous. (We asked for the check 3 times). We spent $40 and left so dissatisfied. Won't be going back anytime soon... Or at least until new ownership comes again... Which probably won't be long if the service and food remain the same. No way this place could stay in business. Don't waste your time here...."
2;I love hot dogs so when I noticed this spot for a quick bite in the alley next to Q outside Flamingo I went for it. Food is pricey in Vegas so a quick bite was a nice change from the LONG lines for $$$ everywhere. No wait. I'm in! Great onion rings, Chicago dog was good, bun was a bit crusty, toppings good, but the Detroit Coney looked amazing. Guy next to me got his after I ordered. \nNoticed a lot of local employees popping in to grab a bite at the counter. Always a good idea to follow the locals and I was not disappointed.
1;Disappointed.  Farhers Day dinner service was slow (the bartender served us despite wait staff on floor, the guy did his best, but eh).  The prices are Scottsdale high. But all 5 of us were unimpressed with food quality and flavor. Ahi sashimi was delicate and tasty, thus the 2nd star.  Sushi was meager for the price.   Too many good sushi/teppanyaki restaurants out there to be wasting your time here.
3;Had my birthday dinner there on Monday night and it was delish!  This high praise is a BIG deal because I almost never have pizza and have high expectation of the Upward group as well!  The pizzas and pasta were wonderful although we over ordered for our group size but the real star was the wine cooler.  With cute presentation and great flavors, these bevvies were a hit.  I dig the ambiance and the drive through pick up lane and am betting this concept multiplies quickly.  One small quibble: the food is fairly high priced as pizza goes, which I don't mind but I really think the wine coolers should be priced more humbly (or  have specials that make up for it).
3;Very loud for my taste on a monday night, but the man working the bar was beyond attentive. I tasted the well-balanced Reuben and some gooey fluffy delightful battered cheese curds.
0;The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.
3;We went on the fifth night they were open.\nThe staff was very attentive, the chef came out and chatted with us, the d\u00e9cor was very nice and the food was very good (not great).\nI expect that the food will have improved by now, as I never have been to a restaurant week one, where there wasn't a bit of fine tuning needed.\nFor now 4 stars, maybe 5 next time!
1;It was one of the first nice weekends in Montreal and we had heard that there were some nice rooftop restaurants open for brunch.  We arrived and sat down and were quickly surprised to find that they were not offering brunch, only lunch.  The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.\n\nWe got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  \n\nAfter we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.  Overall I would definitely not return as the food was below average and the service was pretty poor.
4;"A \""must try\"" place. The sushi is ALWAYS fresh, the service is ALWAYS fast, the chefs are ALWAYS nice and ready to recommend something.It is a little pricey comparing to other places, but definitely worth your $.\nHowever..this place is SO tiny..and if you got on a Saturday or Friday night..you would have to wait 30minutes at least to get in..but we ALWAYS wait 'cuz we'r good sushi loverz :D"
1;Customer service here is terrible!  The teenage Asian girl there never has a clue to anything. Please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe you'll have more happy customers
3;I came here with my boyfriend after a day at Carowinds and was pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. Usually I pick the pho restaurants we go to but he suggested this one, and I would most definitely come here again. It's located in a nice little shopping complex on the second story. \n\nThe restaurant itself has quite a few tables but it was pretty full because Saturday night. However, we were seated quickly and given menus. You can get pho in 4 different sizes, which I LOVED. There's a big bowl, a just right bowl, a small bowl, and a bowl for kids (I assumed). Extra points for that. Price points are pretty reasonable for the sizes as well. I ordered a small bowl of pho (their most popular combo of meats) and my boyfriend got the biggest pho with flank and rare eyeround with no onions and cilantro. I was sick earlier during the day and I was able to keep my food down, which was nice.\n\nThe broth was very light and clear which means that they boiled it for a long time. It was really flavorful and I slurped up pretty much every single drop. I also liked that they had lime wedges and not lemon ones (and they were very generous with their lime, bean sprouts and basil). Overall, very delicious. Service was also very good! Water glasses were constantly checked and everyone seemed very nice.\n\nComplaints: as my boyfriend was signing the check, I saw a sizable black bug on the ground. And the sanitation score was only 90. I mean, being Asian, I'm not tooooo picky about that... but the bug was honestly pretty gross. Yep.
2;"Although we had recommendations from a friend to go to another place for brunch, we decided to try Pamela's when we saw that they had four stars on Yelp and there was a HUGE line on the street waiting to get in. \n\nFirst things first, if you are thinking about going here: They are cash only. There's a PNC bank with an ATM machine right around the corner on Penn Ave if you, like us, don't normally carry cash. Then, even if there's a huge line, go inside right away and put your name in the waiting list. We waited a good ten minutes in line before realizing that the line was meaningless - you really need to have your name in the list, and then go outside and wait. The line goes pretty fast, though, so don't get intimidated by the size of it.\n\nOur son had a feta and spinach omelet and loved it (another AWESOME). I had a veggie and feta omelet, and my husband the ham and cheese. Our omelets were OK - nothing to rave about it like our son was doing about his spinach and feta. And the omelets were kind of tiny, especially when compared with the amount of potatoes that are served in the plate. I did wish the omelet was the star and \""kind of the plate\"", not the potatoes and toast. Looks like their strength is in the carb world, after all. My son and I also tried the hotcakes - my first time having it and they were worth every single second of stomach pain the gluten gave me after eating a few bites. The outskirts of the cakes were really crunchy like a waffle cone, and the inside is a thin, light pancake. Really good! I just couldn't eat a lot not only because of the gluten, but also because of the guilt - they are NOT a diet food. VERY buttery, but what else would you expect of them, right? As I told my husband, they taste like the ultimate winter breakfast comfort food. I can only imagine a really cold morning, freshly brewed coffee, and hotcakes. Yum! \n\nAnd talking about coffee, theirs was really good. Not too strong and not bitter at all, just the way I like it. The waitress eventually left a carafe of decaf for me at the table, which I really appreciated, because their mugs are kind of tiny. \n\nFinal thing to be aware: When we were done eating we waited forever for the check to come (our waitress could have been a bit less absent...). When we finally asked the waitress for the check, she told us with a \""this is the most natural thing in the world\""  face that the check had been delivered with our food a long time ago. How come we didn't think of that, right? We really didn't see the check among the 300 other things in the table. So if you are not from the area and don't know how things work over there, bring cash, put your name in the list, and keep an eye out for the check which comes WITH your food.\n\nThree stars because I didn't think that the breakfast was that awesome. Probably would think otherwise if I knew their system, ate gluten, and wasn't aware of carbs."
1;I am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick.
4;In a word.Awesome! I was looking for a Chicago bar to watch my Blackhawks and yelp found Brando's and I found my new family! I've never felt so welcome before. From the time a walked thru the doors. From the Bartenders , especially Megan and my Waitress Heather and owners who are hands on. Make you feel like part of the family . And I can't forget about the food! Chicago style pizza to sliced beef, served wet or dry. You can't go wrong! Great prices and service bring me back every time. I found Chicago in Vegas!!!
3;Remedy's is one of those neighborhood bars with gambling that Vegas has so many of. Let's do this review in a pros & cons style based on 2 years of giving them our business. \n\nPros: \nEasy interstate access off I-515 or as some call it the 95. \nAmple parking. \nNice building on the outside. \nDark but nice on the inside. \nPlenty of HDTV's around the bar and strategically placed so you can watch pretty much anything that's on at the time. \nSeparate, glassed off non-smoking area if you want to eat without the smoke. \nDrinks: strong pours by knowledgeable bartenders who know their stuff. \nFood: from fish & chips to nachos they have a pretty nice range of offerings with something for almost everyone. And their sliders have been real kid pleasers around here. \nTHEY OFFER TAKEOUT WITHOUT ATTITUDE. Just walk in, go to the back of the bar and find a bartender and you'll have nicely wrapped bags of food in no time. \nOh and if they say 15 minutes, they mean 15. I like their consistency. \n\nCons: \nService can sometimes be slow. Sometimes...but it's rare. \nFood: I've had the occasional problem like soggy sweet potato fries, or cold onion rings, and I've had maybe 2 orders out of 50+ that had issues where I sent it back or complained. Again, 2 out of 50+. \nI did find a strand of hair on my sweet potato fries once. \nOn a bright day adjusting to how dark the place is can be a little rough. But it's a bar, so I really shouldn't say anything about it but I did anyway. \n\nAgain, I'm looking back over 2 years plus now as I write this and my family keeps asking for their food, and we keep going back. \n\n4 Stars. YMMV but for us Remedy's will be staying on our fail-safe food options list.
3;The original Postino has only gotten better since they separated from LGO, and this new one is the best yet (I'm biased...it's closer to my house and I don't have to valet or fight with the LGO bunnies over parking). I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the feel of the inside. I love the food. The menu looks like it has been updated/revamped a little since the split and everything I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They have this breakfast dish that is a piece of grilled french bread with an egg and grilled asparagus and a little tomato salad...to die for. I love the cheap wine during the day (even on weekends!). The sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is worth a stretch outside your comfort zone. In general I just really like this place. In fact, I like it enough to forgive the sometimes spotty service...which is the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review.
2;"Well... It was dead. The waitress and the chef were sitting in the dark dining area and just talking to each other when we walked in. It was my husbands idea that we should try \""my kind\"" of food, since I'm from the Balkans and we have some similarities with the Russians (Russian/Ukranians own the place). So we got in and the waitress welcomed us and turned on the TV, lots of Turkish music for some reason... Oh and those lights that you find in a club, it was really awful for that peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe waitress was really nice and polite, we didn't needed any explanation with the menu since it was nicely explained and plus I understand most of the language. I ordered the Potato Variniki (basically boiled ravioli with potato stuffing) and they were half empty, guessed they leaked out. But the ones we did get, they were pretty bland but nothing s&p won't fix. Also my side salad for the entree got first to our table, before the app. Our fries (which were also sides to our entrees) also arrived before the main dish. I had the Shish Kabob, chopped pieces of lamb on a giant skewer, which was ridiculouslly huge and looked dangerous, It tasted pretty okay, I got 10 pieces total and it was $15.99... The husband had a lamb sandwich, which was loaded with the same lamb meat, tomatoes, lettuce and lots of tzatziki and it was only $4.99... So I guess I screwed up there :D oh and they too...\n\nIced tea with no ice... Which meant freshly brewed and not cooled and then poured over the ice. \n\nThey do have delivery in the near area, so I guess we'll order next time. ;)"
0;I am a little confused as to how this place got so many good reviews. Perhaps I went at the wrong time.\n\nI went to Sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad, the food was disappointing as well. Our hostess was impatient and forgetful. Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous, not in a good way, with the imitation crab. If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go.
2;It's Buca Di Beppo.  The food is going to be mediocre Italian because that's the type of restaurant it is.\n\nOur waitress must have had something against my father in law.  She was rude when we sat down, she didn't take his drink order, and she didn't bring him water.  Too bad he was the one paying.\n\nBut the food was good and it came out quickly.  She eventually warmed to my father in law and he got his drink and was happy enough.  \n\nThree stars because you know what you are getting food-wise when you walk in.  Service makes or breaks chain restaurants.
0;Horrible customer service. I have to wait 40 min. To return a charger that doesn't work.
2;I chose this place based on its 4.5 star rating and assumed it had to be the best choice in town. Once again, this strategy has left me feeling duped and disappointed. \n\nYou can smell the smokey BBQ outside. But that smell somehow did not transfer into our food. \n\n1. Service was impersonal. Asked for straws twice. No refills offered. Server said goodbye and thank you after walking away from the table with her back to us 10 feet away. \n\n2. Food was nothing special. Pulled brisket and chicken sandwiches were  bland, and luke warm. Ketchup and BBQ sauces seemed like cheap generic brands. Coleslaw was too thickly cut and what's with the honey mustard dressing? Never had coleslaw like that. \n\n3. $7.50 for a plain average 4 ounce sandwich, and you charge extra for coleslaw which would normally come on a sandwich like this anyway? \n\nWill not return. Might just pack a picnic lunch for our next adventure to Wickenburg.
1;Great find. Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis. I ordered their well vodka for  a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was $7. At nearby Venues in carefree, during Happy Hour, their 6 oz. martini to the brim with the Well vodka is $7. I am very eager to go back as their wine is good and reasonably priced but since I am a martini drinker, I may not go back. A shame.
0;"Extremely poor seating layouts, be prepared to pay 50% extra on top of your $10.00 ticket for \""premium seats\"" that are really the only seats that allow you to watch the movie without breaking your neck or sitting next to a wall."
2;I was so happy when Vaqueros expanded to this location. The same people who own the one on 18th Ave and Southern also own this one! This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch. The burritos are always quickly served and are humongous for the price. If you dine in, there are free chips available. I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice. This isn't a very fancy place but it's sure to curb your Mexican food cravings. PS- They make a killer Super Nacho/Fry (which should be shared unless you plan on going into cardiac arrest).
0;"This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting."
4;I have to say I found Grinders on yelp and I tried it because of the great reviews and all I have to say is they were right:-). The food was awesome the staff was so friendly I felt like I was a regular the way they all conversed with me I will be back I got a pizza and the cheeseburger sub incredible my friends loved it too.  Thx you grinders see u soon.  Steve from Southwest Airlines
4;I have spent way too much time on these little Airport shuttle buses but I'm really glad they're available as I don't fancy paying \u00a320+ to get a taxi from the airport into the city centre. As previous reviewers have mentioned it's only \u00a33 for a single and \u00a35 for a return - just make sure you don't lose your ticket. The buses run 24 hours so whatever time your flight is you can hop on one of the trusty shuttle buses to take you to or from the airport.\n\nThere are various stops on the bus route including Edinburgh Haymarket and Waverly train stations and I like the fact that the driver take on a sort of tour guide role pointing out different tourist sites along the way and greeting people who get on and off the bus along it's journey. The last time I was on it the driver gave a cracker of a joke as we passed Edinburgh Zoo... it was that good I've completely forgotten what it was so maybe he shouldn't give up the day job just yet.\n\nThis is a great service, the staff are always friendly which makes a change as most bus drivers seem to be the angriest people in the world. There's ample space on the buses giving you lots of leg room after being cooped up on a plane for a few hours, there's also lots of space for luggage too so you won't need to worry about being crushed by someone's suitcase bulging at the seams.
0;An absolute waste of a drive from southeast side of town to this pretender of White Castle!!  I just wanted to try a few first and then order more for the rest of us in the car after. I ordered two cheeseburger for $1.92. Cold and flavorless. They were not cooked within the last hour for sure. A young kid was in the walk up area sitting in a tall bar stool with his back towards me as I approached and him having a discussion with someone behind the wall.I literally was handed my burgers in less than 15 seconds!!! then the kid sat back down to finish his conversation. Please buy a frozen pack of White Castle from the market until they actually open at the Casino Royale in another 2 Months!!
3;This place has everything.  I stopped in to check out the grill accessories and found so much more.  When you walk in they have a popcorn machine for you to enjoy a treat while you shop and the smell kind of gets you in the mood, you know?\n\nThe staff at Blackhawk are extremely helpful.  I could walk 10 feet without someone asking me if I needed help.  It was very nice.  I tend to wander so it was nice to have someone to point me in the right direction.\n\nPrices were high, on just about everything I looked at but considering the neighborhood and the clientele, the place obviously does ok.
4;This place was great, my phone looked like it was dropped from a plane, and the screen sensor was broken, which prevented me from using the touch screen on my phone. Went 12 miles out of the way to go to this place and it was well worth it. They gave me good directions of how to get there via bus. They did a free diagnoses and had great customer service. They were able to fix my phone within a good time range and it works better than ever.
1;Too busy with too much wait time\n\nFood was just ok. This is a classic example of what people perceive as a good place because it was a blind mouse leading another blind mouse\n\nNo it was not worth the wait. Next door brunch is just as good.\n\nIHOP is just as good no kidding.
2;I stumbled into GB this summer when I was at a conference in Scottsdale. Didn't really feel like paying an arm and a leg for hotel resort food so I ventured off into the desert, on foot, to find some yummy food. \n\nI sat in the bar area since seating was at a premium in the restaurant. It was a Friday night. I ended up ordering a Margarita since it was national Tequila day. It was pretty good. For vegetarians there wasn't a lot of non-meaty foods to eat. I ended up ordering a bunch of different sides for my meal. The food was really tasty and didn't cost me too much. \n\nUnfortunately, the service wasn't great and it did take a long time get served. But then again, it was a busy Friday so I didn't really mind. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I'll probably do a little more researching to find a place that's a little more local and a little less of a chain.
0;"let me detail my last experience:\n\nI called network automotive on Main St. in mesa for a quote for replacing a part on my vehicle.  I had done my own diagnosis and was confident that the problem would be remedied with this procedure.  On this call they took down the information and said they would call me back with a quote.  They did return my call later that day and left a message saying to give them a call back.\n\nI called them back the next day and received a quote that seemed reasonable given the labor rate, and the price that I could find the part for.  I made an appointment for the next day at 8:00 am.  I was under them impression that the part was already ordered considering I was a return customer, and I had an appointment set. \n\nI arrived right at 8am to have the procedure done.  I handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait.  What I saw happen next was that my truck was pulled into the back corner angled away from me, the hood put up, and not one person went near my vehicle for an hour and a half.  At around 9:30 I asked them if I should bring it back at a more convenient time.  They said they receieved the wrong part from the parts supplier.  I just looked at the person expecting him to tell me the correct part was on the way and he didn't; rather, he asked, and I quote, \""why do you want to replace that part?  I've never had to replace that part before.\""  I must remind you that on the first phone call I explained to them exactly what I wanted to have replaced and why.  At this time I explained to him exactly what I had already explained twice already, on the phone.  After I finish he tells me that he can only find the part I need for over 3.5 times the price that I could find it for from Autozone.  As this is all happening the tech has finally decided to pull out the old part, and he comes walking in to the desk area with it, and he says, \""yeah, it's bad.\""  This made me think that it took about 2 minutes to get the part out.\n\nAll in all, I ended up paying 90% MORE than what they originally quoted me, I paid 125% extra for the part, and paid for 1.5 hours of labor, for a 15 minute job.  I was there right at 8, and was able to roll out at 10:50.\n\nIn conclusion I will never take my vehicle back there.  My vehicle is over 10 years old and I maintain it very well, as it is an essential part of my livelyhood.  It's unfortunate that we cannot count on a local business such as this one to take care of the people from the town where they do business.\n\nI see a lot of people that give rave reviews over their alignments, and I'm sure they probably do a good job, but if you need parts, prepare to get GOUGED."
0;Perfect hotel for Phoenix they are as  racist as Arizona is .\nGood job Westin keeping it real for AZ  .. \nYou should change your publicity  only white people allow ..
0;It's cheap, it's clean but slow as molasses. I've been waiting for 40 minutes to leave the airport and our driver is outside speaking to a colleague. I wish they could figure out their issues some other time.\n\n(This is based on an experience in January 2013, during CES)
1;"I hate to write a bad review for this place after years of going. I love using Yelp to compliment a business but feel that this review is for the business to know what is unacceptable. I met my cousins for lunch and I was first to get there. The hostess Jessica told me she would have to wait to seat me till my group arrived.  I don't mind that policy. I ended up going to the bar while waiting and realized my cousin including her 7 year old daughter sat themselves in a booth. My little cousin is seven so she didn't have the intention to annoy the hostess by picking a table. After a minute the hostess came up and said word for word, \""You cannot ever sit yourself. Never ever do that.\"" Then whipped her hair and stormed away like a teenager having a tantrum. I love the food, the service is always great but unfortunately I will not want to go back after my family and I were told off by a kid.  Love you LGO.. I hope your staff is expected to have better manners in the future."
4;"Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!"
0;"I was part of a large party, over 20 of us had our hair done that day. I decided to get a tiny up do. I just wanted a simple pony tail with a little poof and my clip in extensions snapped to my pony tail. So the stylist told me that she doesn't want to blow dry my hair because it's easier to do the updo this way. I was fine with it because I said she's a stylist and knows what she's doing. I go to pay up front and it comes out to $80!! She didn't even blow out my hair she just did a pony tail and clipped my extensions in! I told the receptionist \""that I thought $80 was way to much for a pony tail and NO BLOW OUT\""  said said well it took our stylist 1hr.. I  was so disappointed I could have did it better at home and saved $80 plus a $10 tip\n\nI was a really loyal customer to dry bar and so were my family and friends. What a turn off when you feel like your being takin advantage of. I will make sure to tell all my close ones to be careful they don't rip you off!"
1;This is the only Starbucks in my neighborhood so I go here by default. Friendly enough staff but they are consistently sooooo slow :(
3;I stumbled on this place a few months ago when I wanted to treat myself. LOVE IT. I get a mani/pedi for $30! Pedicure includes hot stone massage, warm lotion and a great leg massage. I've gone here a few times, never with an appointment and they always take me and get me to a massage chair to start my pedicure. \n\nThe only thing that surprised me was when my boyfriend asked for the paraffin on his hands, the girl brought out 2 plastic bags with warm wax in them and told him to slip his hands in while she tied them around his wrists. Seemed a little tacky but the result was smoother skin. \n\nI'm going back there this Friday again to prepare for sandal season.
3;First of all, I love any place where I can drink sangria outside. That, combined with the fact that their outdoor space is super cute and their sangria is great, makes me pretty excited about this place. Coming at prime time on a Saturday night, I also expected that I would have to wait for a table, but we were able to sit right down. I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. I normally get the tacos, so last night I branched out a bit with the Tamales and the Tijuana Street Dog. Both were great! I also got to try the Chile Relleno, which I will probably order next time.\n\nIf the service had been a little better, I would have considered giving a 5-star rating. The service was fine - everyone was very friendly, but it was very slow, taking almost 15 minutes after ordering to get chips and salsa. This could have been a fluke, of course, so I will reconsider after coming back again.
3;sometime i'm in the mood for some hard packed ice cream. not this frozen yogurt or frozen custard stuff. just good old fashioned ice cream. this place has very good quality ice cream. chocolate dipped waffle cone was a decent enough to hold my delicious ice cream. they have a bunch off different flavors so i order whatever i feel like.
1;"Giving two stars based on the food, location (walking distance from my house) and the decor are amazing... If it weren't for these things Id give negative stars, I've eaten here twice now and had very different experiences...\n\nA few days ago I came here for the first time and brought my mom and Andy. We were very impressed with the rustic decor and the outside setting. It's absolutely beautiful on the patio. \nWe had the butternut soup, that was phenomenal. Butternut squash with creme frise and leeks for garnish.  \nFor entrees we each had a different sandwich, I had the bbq brisket. I was expecting a bbq sauce since that's what the cashier told us.. but none of the less it was still great.\nAndy had the Pastrami sandwich which also was missing a sauce bit once we put their housemade Dijon mustard on it the sandwich was great. \nThe sweet potato fries are great as well! \n\nNow for the second trip...\n\nCame in last night (Tuesday around 7pm) and sat at the bar. We never received service, we waited about 10 minutes before we went up to the cashier. The girl told us the bartender never showed up so we had to order at the register. We ordered the calamari, shrimp tacos, and the butternut soup. I asked the girls (two blonde girls and one brunette) if there were any nuts in the tacos or the calamari. I AM DEATHLY ALLERGIC to tree nuts and peanuts. I've been admitted to the hospital twice with my throat closing due to my allergy. No one knew so they asked the cooks. They just shrugged and said there wasn't. When I asked if they were certain (i had forgotten my epipen at home because we walked to the restaurant) they started laughing at me. \nWe also ordered the Apricot Cider, so we took our drink and headed outside. When our food arrived we noticed the calamari was accompanied with a green sauce. The brunette told us it was a parsley sauce. We also noticed there weren't any leeks on the butternut soup... That made the soup very bland without the added flavor. \nWhen I tried a piece of Calamari dipped in the parsley sauce it really tasted like pesto. Andy and I headed inside to ask about it. Because pesto 90% of the time is made with Pine nuts. We were told yes it was pesto. Andy dialed 911 because no one knew if there were nuts in the pesto. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT KNEW. Then when I told the brunette girl my throat would literally close she LAUGHED and said oh don't be a drama queen, no it won't. ....\n\nWhat can I even say about that. 20 minutes later we finally found out the pesto was nut free. After me having a full blown freak out panic attack it completely ruined my experience here. When asked if they could bring us ice cream on the house we declined and the blonde girl asked what could she bring us and I jokingly said another drink, she immediately brought us another bottle of apricot cider with a receipt. Then said we could pay for that anytime. \n\nNow, I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. (13 Years now...) My professional opinion and advice is this, TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Especially the cooks. I can forgive a ditzy cashier girl but I can't forgive a \""chef\"" that has no idea what they're cooking. Hire a manager to oversee daily operations and handle guest issues. If this would have happened to anyone else I'm sure they wouldn't have been as nice as Andy and I. \n\nI want to come back. I liked the food and you can't beat the location. But these kinks need to be worked out before they kill someone, because no one is trained or held accountable."
3;Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition.
2;I don't know. I've been here when it was kind of crowded and when it was packed. It's more fun to me when it's not wall-to-wall people, the way it's set-up. \n\nThe tables they have roped off on the sides of the dance floor don't make sense to me. When it's packed, people tend to lean against the back of the couches or sometimes sit on them and security gets upset. Obviously I learned this the hard way, but good luck trying to regulate that!!
3;Great addition to the neighborhood.  Good food & coffee. I wish they had longer hours because I like to eat lunch at 3:30. Or a mid afternoon tea & pastry.
1;Over priced food, nothing special. All the sides suck. \n\nI ordered the NY strip steak which was huge and delightful. My boyfriend ordered the $70 Waygu ribeye and it was horrid! All of the sides we ordered were extremely plain. I could cook it with more flavor with my eyes closed. Its supposed to be the best restaurant in the Rio but honestly there was nothing that stuck out except the high prices.
0;If I could give this place 0 stars I would, that is how bad the food was. It seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn. I didn't think it was humanly possible, but I have finally found a buffet worse than Hometown Buffet. Good job Circus Circus.
1;"Went to this place today  to grab a beer to find the  bartender threatening to send the waitress home for not greeting someone that was  aiming to sit at the bar. I didn't find it my place to say anything to him about it because I don't like conflict but it seemed to really have embarassed and or pissed the girl off. I asked her how she was doing and she said \""I'm doing the best I can, thank you for asking\"" sweet girl even after. Hated to see her embarrassed like that so I threw her 5bucks because I felt her pain and the guy seemed like an asshole but I still gave him a tip for the sake of service."
3;"I am a fan of the ambiance, the food is good but in comparison to their price I was expecting better. and their portion was way too small, it does fill me up because I don't eat much anyways. but you are use to big portion meals, Hunny u better expect at least $150 per person without the drinks. but the presentation of the food was great.. its almost too freakin cute all I'm thinking is really? this is my tiger roll? a lil tiny 6 piece sushi, even my wasabi & ginger was bigger than that -_- ...  But i did have a new discovery, thanks to this place I discovered my new fav. drink. \""benzai bunny sparking sake white peach flavor\"" mmm mmm mmm!!!!! i can down few bottles of that ... \n\nthe ambience is trendy says on yelp, but honestly it was more casual... I've seen ppl dressed up in t-shirt, jeans, and jersey's... theres a TV right behind and above my head playing basketball games.. I see my friend being distracted by the game couple times smh lol...."
3;"Like I mentioned on my previous post (7/24/09), I went back and tried it twice to see if anything changed. The first time, everything was excellent; they have this spicy crab/seafood soup that is soooooo good, that I kept going back for second and third and fourth....The meats were marinated just right and everything was wonderful. I walked out of the restaurant thinking I should give them 5 stars now. I came back the second time a week later b/c I want that spicy seafood soup. Guess what, no spicy soup that day. Also, I guess they put too much sugar into the kalbi, that it burned when it got onto the grill, even though the heat was medium. I looked around and realized other tables had the same problem. The sugary stuff from the kalbi got on the the grill, which created blacken burned layer and smell, which made everything tasted not so good. In conclusion, I guess the quality vary each day, so you may get great food or you may not at this restaurant. I will still visit them again. One cool thing about this restaurant is because the ceiling is so high and open, you don't get that nasty stinky smell on your clothes and body that you normally get when cooking food at your table. Don't get me wrong, your clothes will still smell, but not \"" have to go home and shower b4 going out again\"" bad."
3;The Platinum is a very nice hotel.  You don't pay top prices, and you get almost-luxury.\n\nEvery room - even the smallest - are very large suites, all with balconies and full kitchens.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I didn't use much of the kitchen or living room so I can't comment there, but the bed was super comfy.  The gigantic jacuzzi tub was awesome, as were the two sinks, and the two tvs (though I only used the one in the bedroom).  \n\nThere were a few less-than-luxury elements I noticed, such as there being no bedsheet and the comforter being put on backwards, one of the water handles on the tub leaking, a complicated and ultimately non-working alarm clock, and a lack of hot-enough water in the shower two of my three mornings (though certainly nowhere near cold).  But, it was a really nice stay for the price.  The wifi worked great.\n\nThe staff is very nice and let you alone, and the valet attendants are extremely friendly, quick, and helpful.  The pool area seemed nice, though it was late December  so aside from checking it out I didn't visit it (though I probably would have for the jacuzzi had I not had the jetted tub of my own).\n\nThe hotel was quiet and the room service menu looked great, though I didn't try it.  The fitness center is what you'd expect - a hardwood floor room with three large TVs, 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and weights and benches.  My only complaint is that there was heat blasting straight on you every 10 minutes.  Not awesome, but whatever.  \n\nThe Platinum is a great choice if you want a nice place that ISN'T on the strip, but is easily within walking distance.
0;"Another place I'd like to give a negative star review.\n\nFor starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games.\n\nWe were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda.\n\nRealizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children.\n\nThe manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said \""All the pizza have been brought out\""\n\nDude, we DIDN'T GET OURS!\n\nWhatever, they were just barely doing what they had to.\n\nI would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there.\n\nFor the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures."
2;We reserved online our rooms online at vegas. com, mostly because the price was fantastic. \n\nWhen we arrived, the check in was reasonably quick, and our room was clean and comfortable. A little dated, but not bad really. \n\nFor its' price, location, and convenience Excalibur is just fine. I don't think it deserves the low ratings it gets.
0;They were just featured today on channel 5's dirty dining. Six major violations. What a bummer, I really like this place, but 6 major violations?
0;"Worst Breakfast Burrito for too much money.  For $9 - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla.   I told them not to add ham because I read on their web site before I drove over that there was bacon.  No bacon and could not taste the cheese.   I asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it...  \""we only put in 2 eggs\""  Well it was one too many.   The salsa was the horrible NYC type.   We are too close to the border for that. It was nice and hot though."
0;"HORRIBLE! I WAS a customer of this place for several years, until new management took over within the last couple years. Took my truck in for a coolant system issue, and was told I needed a BRAND NEW RADIATOR. After everything, and a \""$100 great customer\"" discount, I was quoted $1,200. I went to the Big O across the street from this terrible Midas, and was quoted $500, and my radiator was JUST FINE. I will never go back to this Midas, as now they're just a bunch of con-men. No wonder their business is so slow now."
0;Had a scheduled appt for these guys to come out and fix patio door-no show-no call-didn't return my call. Tells me they are independently wealthy and don't need new business.  Advice to everyone, Pass on this one when looking
2;In my quest to exercise during the freezing weather, i'll go on long walks in the underground city.This part of the walk is always interesting.\n\nI start off at the basement at the bay's and can make it an almost loop to Metro Place des arts. It can be done in roughly an hour.\n\nI'm more into the food than the boutiques, we have one of our last Dunkin Donuts, a Mcdonalds, smoked meat shop, a couple of sushi joints and some middle eastern grub.\n\nThere's a few coffee shops in the food court as well and the seats are pretty comfortable.\n\nI normally have a very good sense of direction, but not here for some reason, can never get where I want to go because all the exits and stores look alike to me. It can get very rushed at around 5pm, but it's nice and quiet afterwards.
1;This place never gets it right. I recently took my car in for their $26 oil change/lube/car wash special, where you basically get a free car wash. The service guy was very nice, noting things I probably should replace, but that I could wait on for another few thousand miles.  He did let me know that I needed a new air filter and offered to upgrade the car wash to a supreme if I went ahead and replaced the filter, which I agreed to. However, I specifically asked that they 1) not forget to include the air freshener, which my mom said they always forget , and 2) vacuum the interior very well, since I'd had my dogs in the car and hairs were all over. I get the bill for my car and they've charged me for the upgrade to supreme car wash, so I have to have them remove the charge. Then I get my car and they've forgotten the fragrance. Finally, I get home and look at the hatch area of the interior to find it covered in sand and dog hairs, like they never even vacuumed at all, let alone vacuuming especially well, like I requested. This place is for the birds, to be polite, but they do have a very nice waiting area, if that's what you like in a car wash.
3;Our first stop after landing in Vegas and checking into our hotel was to find some lunch.  We had no particular plans where to eat, just knew we needed something asap.  The Paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the Mon Ami Gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.\n\nService started out a little slow.  We were seated, and then waited a bit longer than expected for the server to come by.  However, our meal made up for this minor issue, as everything we both ate was very delicious.\n\nThe free crusty bread was amazing.  Could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\n\nI decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  The flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  A pure pleasure to eat.  Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\n\nMy husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\n\nI recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.  I'd have no reservations about eating here again one day.  Was a great start to our last Vegas trip, for sure.
2;"Ok I guess...Ate there this morning about 8:45. Sat down, was acknowledged with a nod and be with you in a minute...but was closer to 7 or 8. Ordered \""the handful\"" which has 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, and 2 bacon. Wanted to trade bacon for veggies but was told it would be $1 more even though on side items, the bacon cost more than the veggies...go figure.  Make the customer happy and he'll come back tomorrow, don't and he won't.\nIt was decent, can't complain too much, but can't give thumbs up either."
2;Giddy Up!\n\nThe have a mechanical  bull!   Wait...  They have a MECHANICAL BULL!   \n\nI really enjoy watching drunk people on mechanical bulls - you just cannot pay enough for this comedy.\n\nThis a country bar / bbq place with limited seating (this particular evening).   They have a large dance floor where all the ladies get their line dancing in.    The wait staff wear bikinis and chaps - it is pretty hot (male perspective).\n\nThe beer is cheap (about $3 / per domestic).   I enjoyed the evening but had to move on to the next stop.\n\nGive it a shot if you want cheap beer and get some line dancing in.   It is one stop of many on the strip :-)
4;Kevin and his team did a great job of getting our sunscreens up on our house with a tight deadline. They were professional and at the end stated if there is anything you find that needs attention, don't hesitate to call.
3;"My mate and I just checked out the new Rio rendition of the Las Vegas San Gennaro Feast on its opening day, and other than having great difficulty finding it and a parking spot in a Rio lot, we both pretty much enjoyed the food and entertainment. I thought the Feast was situated behind the Rio, and it was.  But it is not accessible from Valley View Boulevard. The best way to reach it is to enter the Rio and go around the Carnival World Buffet right to the back and out the Rio near Gaylord Indian Restaurant.  Signage is horrible until you reach the back doors of the Rio that lead to the Feast. I needed to ask the security guard manning the Rio Security Desk how to get to the Feast, just as did the person in front of me. \n\nOnce there, the usual sights and smells of a wide array of Italian and other cooking food products were prevalent, with several vendors touting their products as potential patrons walked by. I wanted to try a new food vendor this time--and did--but to my disadvantage. The hand-tossed pizza looked real tasty with cheese melting nicely on slices that were dotted with pepperoni. But the taste of these slices was bitter, and tomato paste was much too dominant an element in the sauce. At least the outfit selling this mediocre stuff is from Northern California, and only sells at fairs and festivals (I checked), so you won't accidentally run into this pizza in the Las Vegas valley. The two pizza slices I ate set me back $8.00. I am going to Biaggio's for lunch later today to get some first-rate pizza to make up for last night's clinkers! \n\nMuch better was the Philly Cheesesteak I bought from an Anthony's booth, as I did last year. I watched it grilled before me. Since I hadn't eaten all day in preparation for the Feast, dressed with self-administered ketchup and packed with small cut up pieces of cooked beef, red and green peppers, white onions, and well-melted Mozzarella Cheese inside a soft 6-inch bun, this $9.00 beauty was worth the high-sounding cost. Diane's Potato Tornado, greasy bent circles of deep-fried potatoes that were a cross between thick potato chips and french fries, also tasted quite good. And, a large-size bag of Cinnamon Roasted Almonds that wasn't that big was steeply priced at $9.00 but offered both of us a nice sweet ending to our dinners. Everything was washed down with very reasonably priced bottles of spring water and Sierra Mist purchased at the Rio's own Cafe Martorano booth. \n\nWe didn't play any games of chance/skill but I saw a huge banana, pig, Bart Simpson, and other stuffed creatures in attendees' hands, so some people were clearly winning major prizes. As in the past, our main focus was on the food and entertainment. \n\nAnd, the entertainment we saw was excellent and largely different than what we observed in previous years. Dick Contino, Tony Sacca, and Lena Prima performed once again, but there were also the Motown Divas, Chris Lista from the East Coast, an actor-singer who plays Frank Sinatra in \""The Rat Pack Is Back\"" at the Rio, the bird trainer from \""America's Got Talent\"" appearing with Danny the Parrot, Deja Vu from South Point, and Kim Styles, who belted out a very nice rendition of Adele's \""Rolling in the Deep.\"" The Michael T Orchestra that backs up singers was also once again excellent--especially the saxophonist. The fine live entertainment in the Tony Sacca Show that begins at 8:00 p.m. each night of the festival, and changes daily, is worth the $6.00 price of admission (with coupon) alone. \n\nUniformed Las Vegas Metro officers were clearly visible, the crowd seemed happy and very mellow, debris on tables was picked up by Feast volunteers very soon after a diner got up to leave, and colorful amusement rides were in full bloom.  We were both glad that we attended yet another Feast."
2;"I managed to resist China Harvest Buffet over there, so the diet should be fine...     :-)\n\nUh oh!  What's that yellow sign up there on the left?     :-O\n\nSo I whipped into this nice Church's for the usual, a 2-Piece Meal which gives you a big chicken leg & thigh (Spicy Style in my case), mashed potatoes & gravy, and a drop biscuit with spread.\n\nThings were less than perfect for me at this particular Church's today:\n\n*  The service was weak.  I wasn't thanked for my business, and had to ask several times for some spread for the biscuit, which girl was going to \""go get\"" while my biscuit got cold.  Also had to ask for salt & pepper, which they had hidden under the counter, unlike at other Church's.\n\n*  The seat of my chair was fall-off loose, & someone could break their neck just sitting on it!\n\n= = = = = =\n\nIt wasn't all bad:\n\n*  The bathroom was clean & properly set up & stocked.\n\n*  My lunch was served up piping hot & delicious!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)\n\n*  The value was terrific at $1.99 for everything, & girl even gave me an ad with an identical replacement coupon, just in case I ever mess up again on the diet.     :-)"
1;"My wife and I were dying to go to Buddy's new place in Vegas. So I made reservations ahead of time and couldn't wait. We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. \n\nSo we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. \n\nWe wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \""ALLA VODKA\"". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. \n\nOh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a caf\u00e9 type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. \n\nBut not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks"
0;If I could give Mark Taylor no stars I would. All of their leasing clowns get $11.25 hour.\nGreat pay for what they do! I guess they are told to not let U.S. VETS be approved. My credit score was .3 below acceptable for their $99 security deposit. They wanted a $100 more plus rent would go up $40 per month. The 2 things on the credit report were even listed as identity theft. They didn't care. A women named Amanda said tough no refund for the apartment. Mark Taylor is a true SCUMBAG!
3;Another Food Truck Thursday and my husband decided to try Hey Joe! He ordered the Pancit (rice noodles) and a lumpia (egg roll). I was lucky enough to get to try both items (by try I mean steal off his plate). The food was freshly made to order and came out quickly. The noodles were delicious with their saucy ways. Also the vegetables were delicious. My husband enjoyed the chicken it came with as well. I particularly enjoyed the lumpia - one of the better egg rolls I've had. Super crispy and tasty. Overall, I enjoyed their food and would try again.
1;"Here's why this place deserves a knock off of three stars: the blueberry scone was awful. Blatantly horrible; not sweet, almost savory like, which was odd. Had a weird granular texture as well. My espresso con panna was way more bitter than I expected, bitterer than starbucks'. These were the redeemers: the lemon olive oil cornmeal cake was absolutely excellent. The mocha was great too. The counter worker seemed very friendly and knowledgeable."
2;I must admit Hawaiian food is a great way to end a shenanigan-filled weekend in Vegas. Hearty and full of carbs and protein, it pretty much could be a soupless alternative to pho as a hangover helper.\n\nI ordered the Pork Lau Lau since I've been craving it for the longest time. It comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The pork came out tender and the taro leaves were nice and soft. Not bad for Vegas.\n\nIt's in a random strip mall next to UNLV, prices are pretty affordable for what you get. People keep mentioning the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette? Guess I'll have to try that next time I'm in Vegas. And knowing me, I'll be back sooner than later...\n\nP.S. I remember seeing a banner for a student special too if you still have that Student ID of yours!
2;We used to frequent this place quite a bit, but no longer do so for several reasons:\n\nFirst let me say the food is good. Meats are cooked to perfection and the salad bar is extensive and refreshing. The salads, cheeses, and lobster bisque are all of high quality, and seasoned perfectly. \n\nHowever, the last time we went to Texas de Brazil I was greeted by a rude hostess who had no interest in accommodating a simple request (a table on the side of the Restaraunt so my children did not interrupt anyone else's meal). So when the waiter came around, I asked to be moved and the gracious waitstaff accommodated us. I simply want to be courteous to other diners and not interrupt someone else's good time if my children get restless.\n\nThe food was excellent, and so was the service. Our waiter was attentive and provided every special request of meat that we asked for. I was not expecting what came next...\n\nPrices: I was expecting $45 a plate for adults, $5 for my 10 year old, and no charge for my 6 and 2 year olds, just as the snotty hostess told us. What I got when I looked at the receipt was $50 a plate for the adults, $25 for my 10 year old, and $5 each for my 6 and 2 year olds. That is not including drinks or dessert. I asked the waiter why the tab was so off, and he stated the prices had been raised. I was not advised of this, and the hostess specifically gave me different numbers. \n\nI paid and left. I didn't even want to both with speaking to management because I was so disgusted with the hostesses attitude and lack of knowledge which cost me an additional $45. The food is good. The overall experience is good, but Fogo de Chao gets an additional 2 stars for at least having competent, professional, and POLITE staff.
1;Very disappointing!\n\n- Lasagna and agnolotti were tasteless\n- Unpleasantly awkward waiter and bus boy\n- Gorgonzola that came with the meat & cheese plate was amazing\n\nI'd put this restaurant on par with an Olive Garden. With so many other tasty places so close by, I wouldn't waste my time with Buddy V's.
0;Terrible prices and service.  Their yorkies start at 3k.  They are out of their mind.
3;One of the better sushi places I've been to in Pittsburgh!
4;My back yard, nice close scenic hiking trails for all of the family to enjoy! Not many people on the trails, they're well maintained.
4;The Food and service was excellent. I left feeling highly satisfied and will absolutely be coming here again to fulfill sushi cravings. I especially recommend the calamari.
2;I typically go here for a quick bite of Mexican food with friends or just to get a drink. I like to order out due to the countless times I have had bad experience with one guy behind the bar. He acts like he has a hang over and he couldn't get someone to cover his shift every time I go in. LOL Decent food but small portions. I want bigger burros!
3;I recently found this store by accident......I had seen it online but I don't like buying clothes online for many reasons. This store is fantastic because it is very affordable and has soooo many accessories to match just about any outfit you buy there. They have many beautiful blouses, shorts and other great summer clothes for this extreme heat right now. The costume jewelry is fun too...may not be high quality but with the way I like to change my wadrobe and accessories I don't want to spend a fortune anyway! There are some things like jeans that I don't believe you can skimp on and buy inexpensively but all else is fine!
2;My wife and I went here for Easter Brunch because we figured there would be no line and it wouldn't cost much.  We were right.  The buffet was right around $15 and no one was in line (good or bad?).  I thought the buffet was fine for what is is priced for.  It was by no means wonderful but the food was okay.  The weird thing was that all the breakfast items were mixed into every other ethnic station of food.  It was like a little Easter Egg hunt to find all the different dishes.  They do have an omelet stations which I think is a plus.  Bottom line: you get what you pay for.
3;Wow! What a nice surprise. The new Quartier des Spectacles is so nice now, especially with Brasserie T and Bar F. Who would think that this small little entrance at the top of the stairs hid such a gem! It's at the top of the MAC. Beautiful, well lit scenery. It was very quiet for a Friday night. Because of the rain ?\n\n It's fun to see the colourful light patterns and hear music from the museum below. \n\nService is attentive. Plates are beautifully presented (the Chef is the Grandson of a painter). The food is very good. Nothing fancy or exotic, but really delicious. The wine list is interesting, with a good choice of wines by the glass, decently priced.\n\nI understand it's a bit out of the way, but it's really worth looking for!
0;If RumJungle were a person, I would take intense delight in running in place on his genitals.  Then again, if RumJungle were a person, he'd probably be one of those 250 lb. dudes that have a myriad of neck tattoos and work out just enough to have big arms but flabby man boobs.  \n\nAnd although I'm plenty sneaky, my record in my surprising number of street fights over the years is reminiscent of the current state of affairs with California's state budget.  So where does that leave my analogy?  Touche...
3;I am so in love with this place that it is ridiculous. It is trendy, chic and I get so excited to take people here because they always leave impressed. \n\nI most recently went for lunch, and the bloody mary's were amazing. I had to resist getting two. I also go the fruit and greek yogurt filled crepes, which was perfect for Saturday morning brunch. I didn't leave full, but I wanted  a light brunch, which was exactly what I'd gotten. I'm really excited to try it at other times of the day, especially when they are serving the pizza because it looks awesome. \n\nIt's a little hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. I parked in a parking garage a few blocks away and walked over. \n\nI gave 4 stars because the service wasn't outstanding, and the waitress at the time seemed a little flighty and confused. I also didn't know a side of potatoes was an option with my dish until after she'd already served it with some arugula leaves, which was disappointing.
4;I was dragged to this place by my wife who has gotten really into trying new places. I had heard some people talk about it but mostly it was complaints about the price, so I had negative feelings about the place to start. \n\nUpon arriving all I can say is it's not much to look at from the dirt driveway. But once we entered, we were greeted by several extremely friendly hostesses and waitresses. Hands down the restaurant had a fantastic warming, and inviting feeling about it. We were put at ease and that was good because this is part of its charm. The full experience lasted 3 hours. \n\nFor dinner we did a full service chef choice thing where they picked for us the wine and food that is perfectly paired. I'm not much on wine but everything seemed to be better w/ the combination. I had no complaints about the food at all. Perfect. When the bill came I had no problem paying the $300 or so because it was well worth it. Taste, portions, service. All A+ \n\non a side note, we went all out and there are a lot of less expensive items on the menu so price is relative to what you order. The Assume service is shared by everyone.
2;"Someone told me that I was too generous with my 4-or-5-star reviews, so I figured I'd switch it up. (I like writing positive reviews though!)\n\nMy friends and I decided to check out Surrender on Friday night because it was supposedly the \""next big thing\"" in Vegas. Well...I'll start with the good stuff: it was really pretty - especially the pool area - and I bet the daytime beach parties are crazy fun. \n\nAs a nightclub, though...I don't think I'll be going back. First of all, the indoor area is tiny. (Yes, my memory of that part of the night is slightly hazy, but I double-checked with my friends and everyone agreed!) Since the indoor area is so small, we ended up spending most of our time outside being blown away by the wind. Words can't describe how windy it was, so I posted a picture instead.\n\nI wanted to give Surrender two stars, but I can't really give a 2-star rating to a club that has DJs like Steve Aoki and Kaskade. Plus, the outdoor area really is pretty, so I guess this place is worth checking out. Once."
3;It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.
2;Pampas is one of my favorite places to eat back home so I was excited to eat at this location in Vegas.  We found a great deal at those 1/2 price ticket location (they have discounts for shows AND restaurants, I never knew!). We paid $2/each to get $15 off the Meat Rodizio, not bad! Total bill for both of us (including taxes and tips) was $60, which is like 1/2 the bill of the Pampas back home.  Unfortunately, 1/2 the price means 1/2 the quality, I was disappointed in the meat selection.\n\nService was okay, nothing to complain about but nothing to compliment either.  The salad bar had interesting selections (curry??) Maybe they try to fill you up with the cheap stuff. I did like the bread though, yumm. I wish the sirloin were better cooked, they were a bit dry *sadness* The chicken was tender but needed more flavor. The sausages were a bit salty.  Nothing I tried really hit the spot. It wasn't bad but I guess I had higher expectations :(
3;Good crepes, fast and friendly service. We tried a crepe from the sweet and from the savory side: chicken supreme crepe and nutella crepe. A great place to get your crepe fix regardless of what you're in the mood for.
0;Bland food, over-priced, slow service, and dirty.\n\nI walk in to the restaurant and it is warm and reeks of grease.  You know when you can just smell the grease lingering in the air.  The ventilation system needs to be improved or considering how well the place is cleaned the hood system may need a deep cleaning.  The soda fountain has exposed lines and an open drainage system, very unsightly. \n\nAs I am standing there waiting 10 minutes for someone to take our order I started looking around the place.  The walls are dirty, I cannot even guess the last time the fryers were moved in order to clean the old food and filth underneath them.  The fryers have old caked on grease on the sides, again couldn't even fathom a guess as to when it was cleaned last.  My arms stuck to the table we were seated at.\n\nFor a fast food restaurant it took 45 minutes to get our order because they literally fix one ticket at a time.  Sadly, there was only 3 tickets ahead of ours.  We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.  I knew I should have insisted when go somewhere else but my wife really wanted to try the place out.  I had to drive straight home and I spent the next 30 minutes vomiting.  I can make substantially better fish n' chips at home for a fraction of the price and time it took them to fix our order.  Drive out of your way to find a Long John Silvers you will be way better off.
2;"My boyfriend loves buffets so here we are. We came here right after they opened and the food was ok then. Actually it was better then because in the time they have been open they have raised their prices & when we went tonight we paid over $15.00 per adult and that didn't include a drink. Buffets are cheap to feed the kids when they are with us & they get a variety of food. If you're a big fan of crab legs & some of the other \""fancy\"" things they have I suppose it's worth the money. I on the other had preferred sushi at a restaurant not a buffet so I stick to the simple items that are just as good at a place that charges $8.99. Don't get me wrong, the food is good it's just overpriced in my opinion. The restaurant itself is very nice & clean and they do have a variety of food to choose from. I wish they had some coupons that would make me feel better about dining here again!"
0;Worst nail salon in Summerlin. Do not go here. They will tell you they can do what you want and then they don't do it and try to charge your more than quoted. This place is a joke.
0;Ok so I am an city girl living in a desert world, but I'm a pretty nice gal, all things considered, I think... Anyhoo, l I have to say the service at Peter Piper Pizza was one of the most deplorable experiences I have ever experienced, and that is saying alot considering that I have been to Chuckie Cheese (which happens to have the worst pizza ...ever).  The food at Peter Piper Pizza was actually quite tasty, but the service was horrible.   \n\nThe countergirl was rude, and uninformed.  Her supervisor was just as clueless.  \n\nAs a mother I am subject to these kid-friendly pizza joints, but the service was so bad it made Chuckie Cheese look like an exclusive Club!
