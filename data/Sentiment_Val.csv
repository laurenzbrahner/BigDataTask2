4;I stalk this truck.  I've been to industrial parks where I pretend to be a tech worker standing in line, strip mall parking lots, and of course the farmer's market.  The bowls are so so absolutely divine.  The owner is super friendly and he makes each bowl by hand with an incredible amount of pride.  You gotta eat here guys!!!
2;who really knows if this is good pho or not, i was hung tha fuck over and in desperate need of pho therapy. :P but it totally hit the spot and came out super freakin fast!!! omg! aaahhhhh.....\n\ni'm pretty sure it wasn't bad pho tho...meat, noodles, broth, all a-ok. the coffee was good too. thought i was gettin ripped off for a $3 cup of coffee but they gave me a big cup so it's all good! :)\n\nima make pho a must the next time i go to vegas again fo sure!!! yum! :D
4;I LOVE Bloom Salon... all of their stylist are very qualified and provide excellent hair care...I prefer to book my appointments with Andrea, but if she is not available I am not afraid to book with anyone else.  Not only does this salon provide hair care, but they also offer skin, nails and massage therapy!!  What a great place with a relaxing atmosphere...I HIGHLY recommend this place.
0;We were excited to eat here, it is difficult to find. They were closed at 3 p.m. on a Saturday.
2;So this is a place, with food. That much cannot be denied. But you know what? It's a small airport restaurant, and if you're flying in for a $100 hamburger, then a $100 hamburger you can have. And patty melts. And salads. And whatever other Sysco-type delights you might expect. (It was even prime rib night when we were there, but as it was 20 minutes til closing time, I thought better of it.)\n\nI had a perfectly reasonable patty melt myself, and I enjoyed it. The service was really nice, and the views out the window of the evening traffic on approach were phenomenal. Plus, *tons* of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, which was a fun touch.
2;Review for the Lounge/Club:\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \n\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \n\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \n\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \n\nFor the Restaurant:\n\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price.
3;I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P
0;"I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \""all at once\"" so the flavors have little or no chance to \""marry up\"" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \""reserve\"" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \""building\"" of the paella\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\n\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\n\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\n\nRegardless of all this.  Common courtesy is something that I expect from any restaurant.  This place comes up short on just about every thing."
0;Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff. \n\nIf time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob.
4;I have lived here in Phoenix for 9 months now and have had a tough time finding a hair salon as I have thick, curly hair. I have been buying groupons for many places trying them out and none have worked. I bought the groupon for The Green Room to try it out and am absolutely in love with them! \n\nSteph was my stylist and she was amazing! I came in with a specific color I wanted as I will be leaving for two out of town weddings this month and she consulted the owner to make sure I got the right color. They would not let me leave until my color was perfect (my cut was amazing as well)! Eric (the owner) even took time to blow dry my hair after Stephanie's next client came.\n\nI will definitely be going back in the future for cuts and colors. The place was cute and cozy and the staff was super friendly. They definitely made me feel like they cared about me and what I wanted where the other salons just put a color on and let me go. So glad I found them and have found my new salon!
0;Totally gone down the tube. Way overpriced for food out of a box. Deserts are dry, old and inedible. Meat is like boot leather. The oysters stunk of dead fish. Plus just like the Paradise Buffet at Freemont, they were stuck to the shell. Very old.\n   Wait staff was as rude as they come. Wanted a 20% gratuity for my party of 8. This is a BUFFET dang it. WE get our OWN FOOD. Then they seated us 4 to a table across the room from each other. The buffet had 15 people in it. They did this out of spite. Stay away.
4;I look forward to every visit! I always get exactly what I ask for.  I prefer the more natural look and she always delivers! I enjoy my many compliments but always give her the credit she deserves. She is a beautiful artist who makes me feel beautiful too. Thanks!!
3;There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing. \n\nThe other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well. \n\nGlass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.\n\nFinal bill was approx $60 each.
1;"Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice."
3;the food is awesome... but the hostess are not nice....
0;"Got this \""deal\"" on Travel Zoo for $135 - \""normally $220.\""  A horrible joke.  Supposedly a five course meal.  I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the \""scallops\"" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the \""annex\"" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!  Avoid this scam at all cost!"
4;I have promoted shows out of this venue, checked out some of my favorite local bands here, and spent my last birthday here. The owner has always been very hospitable and professional. The security staff is very professional and the bar tenders are always pouring amazing drinks. Needless to say I love this bar anyone who is a fan of live music at intimate venues should like the bar's facebook page for regular updates on upcoming shows.
3;Great sandwiches. And a ton of food.  Wasn't thrilled with their potato salad. Get fries instead.  Restaurant is kind of a kickback from old Vegas. Wait staff was friendly too.
4;"Well, it's ALMOST that time of year again. My favorite celebration... aside from Thanksgiving and Halloween. It's Matsuri. \n\nYeah, the parking rates around heritage square are pretty hefty when a big event like this rolls around. But it's totally worth it. I mean, when and where else in Arizona can you stuff yourself with steamed-right-in-front-of-you nikuman, take photos with samurai, see a kimono fashion show, feel really thankful you're out of high school and no longer as susceptible to the weirdness of cosplay, buy a hapi coat, pet a bunch of shiba-inu, marvel at bonsai trees that are older than your grandmother and watch almost 60 people wail on taiko drums? \n\nOK, I'm a little biased about the drums. But hey. We get quite a crowd, so other people must like it too. ;)"
2;Even with a coupon, the drinks are overpriced ($13 girly drinks, $10 for Jack & Coke)...however, there's something to be said about killing an hour or two on a patio, drinking Jack & Cokes, watching the freaks parade down the strip.
0;I am sooooo upset with PRS. Its not right what renters do with your deposit . We all know that they will find anything to keep your money, but this is ridiculous. And I will not shut up Im going to the news, every review website, write my congress man about this unfair practice. When I moved out the house was 99% perfect. All I missed was LIGHT BULBS. They charged me $70 dollars for 50cent light bulbs. They said everything was good on the phone and then I get the check which was 35% of my deposit.   We gave them slake when they took a year to fix the garage door and then they fix it when we move out. Why couldn't you give us a break?
4;"We recently adopted our dog from my mom-in-law who lives in Casa Grande and I wanted to get Bruno in to see a vet in Tempe. I looked up a few offices and saw this location had an awesome rating. I was pleased to see someone I respect, Shayna K. from Scottsdale Doggie Suites, providing a 5 star rating and that was it. \n\nI immediately decided to make a new patient appointment for my furry baby. The office is clean, the staff is nice, and they made Bruno feel right at home. \n\nDr. Berthiaume came in and was very informative. I think he could tell I was a nervous \""new mom\"" and he helped me stay at ease. He suggested one medication for Bruno which is for heartworm prevention but didn't pressure me into making a purchase right then and there. He gave me a pamplet on it and told me to do some research on my own first. (AMEN!)\n\nWhen I told them about my concern about him scratching his ears a lot, they took swabs but didn't run them. Dr. B. said if he saw anything \""bad\"" he would have ran them for a test but didn't want to charge me for anything Bruno didn't need done. He suggested to have Bruno's stool tested but said we could bring in a sample anytime and they would send it off then. There was NO pressure to have tests done so they could get money out of me. \n\nThey genuinely cared about Bruno and my wallet. I will be going back, this is going to be my dog's doctor, and I appreciate how awesome everyone was. It is so refreshing to find a place that really care about the patients they see and the owners."
0;Cheese sauce.  Not cheese, cheese sauce.  Burnt carne asada and pink Carne asada in the same burrito. They couldn't even make my daughter's quesadilla properly.  This place is to be avoided.
1;I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well.
0;Food was disappointing and ridiculously overpriced.  The whole restaurant reeked of charcoal/mesquite and not in a good way....we should have known the food was going to taste the same.  And it did. Awful.  I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals, but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite, then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return.  And I won't.  The cheese on the burger was absolutely disgusting, a rubbery smoky nightmare.  Stay away from this place.  Not even service could save this place.  If Jasper's couldn't survive in this spot, this place doesn't even have a chance.
1;its ok.  visited on a tuesday night.  had the chicken fried rice... chicken dry.  egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints.  just ok.  service just ok.  price average.  lets just say not memorable.
1;This place is pretty dumpy.\n\nWork sent me to Phoenix for a couple of days.  I had a suite, but it was not very sweet.  The bathroom door didn't shut, and swung open into the middle of the room.  When I got up to go to the bathroom at night, I ran into the door.  I can only blame Country Inn and Suite for the first night, the second night when I bumped into the bathroom door in the dark, I blamed only myself.\n\nThe bed smelled like my old roommate's closet... musty and dirty.  Two of my towels were stained with something yellow, I am hoping coffee and not urine...\n\nI didn't really expect better, but that's my review.
2;"My friend was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to wander into El Segundo Sol.  We really like the ambiance of this place.  The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  \n\nMy pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  \n\nThe service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  \n\nHe was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \""do you have everything you need right now?\"" often interrupting our conversation.  \n\nOn the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip."
4;Great wings, stiff pour and nice bartenders. XO Baer's Den 'till we meet again!
3;The service is what makes this place a restaurant worth returning.  This Glendale location is better than the ones closer to my house.
3;i don't doubt that many people have bad experiences at this restaurant, because I can see how a lot of the food is overpriced the hosting station seemed to be a little lackluster.  My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer\nMain Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong.
2;This is a fun place to stay when you don't want to spend a ton of money on a hotel room.  It is far enough from the strip so that you aren't stuck in that nasty traffic.\n\nThe front desk and valet service is always nice.  Their complimentary drinks (while playing) are always strong and their food isn't too bad.  The pool area is nice although they can use a little more shade options out there. \n\nThis place can feel a little run down from time-to-time in their regular rooms and they definitely need some upgrades.  Outside of that, it is not too bad of a place to visit every now and then.
4;I'm on a four to five star review binge, but they're all deserving, and Bunky's is no exception.\n\nCame here on a Saturday at around 3 for an early dinner and the place was dead. The hostess was sweet as pie and informed us that they were switching over to their dinner menu. It's quite large, with a mix between Italian and Mediterranean fare, but was not overwhelming in the slightest.\n\nTo start, we ordered a hummus appetizer, and it was so incredibly good - served with warm pieces of soft, airy and delicious pieces of pita. Ugh, I'm eating some store brand hummus and crackers as I type this, and they've got nothin' on Bunky's.\n\nI set my eyes on one of Bunky's staples: Bunky's Pasta. It's loaded with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, onions and farfalle noodles. It's mixed with the most mouthwatering creamy marinara sauce. The sauce was sweet and the plate savory, and all worked well together to create a cohesive dish.\n\nI know that Bunky's has some funky hours, but please make time to stop in when they're open. You will be glad you did.
3;I love donuts no matter how you spell them and O Face Doughnuts delivers.  Their staff is super friendly and the donuts are great.  I got the Maple Bacon w/ Maple Mascarpone one and it literally was one that needed a fork and knife. So great and if you're a donut lover, check this place out!
0;My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional.\nNeedless to say, we won't return in the future.
2;The line to check in is really long! Also we booked a king bed but got one queen bed! There was no hot water in the shower either. The location of this hotel is great though because it's in the middle of the strip so I liked that.
2;For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.\n\nWe opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.\n\nThe pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.\n\nFeedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.\n\nI have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.\n\nOverall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.\n\nI'll be back!
0;Waited 20 min before the girl told Us its a 30 min wait..... Didn't know that it take 30 min to make one smoothie.... Would not recommend any one to go before she didn't even seem like she wanted to take our order
1;"In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet. \nI had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \""For this?\"" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet."
2;Somehow Asian food just works at night...Noodles is inside the maze of the Bellagio and it's pretty large. Service is ok, but it's sorta expensive. Like $18 for HK style noodles. Given how complex it is to get in and out of hotels, and if you are craving asian food late at night, I'd go to Noodles....
2;I gave this an A-OK rating because i'm not an expert of PHO. I like the food, but just haven't been to plenty of vietnamese places.\n\nI ordered the spicy beef pho. It was good, very large bowl and the price was great ! This place was recommended to me by my asian friends. And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well, so it's probably a good place. Service was good, even though they were really busy.  I would go again, the menu has plenty of selections.
2;The skybar itself did not wow me, but I guess it's cool that it's different than the usual bars/clubs in Southside.  The place was small and can get kinda steamy if crowded.  Maybe it's better during the warmer season.  It was colder when my friends and I went, so it was covered.\n\nThe pre-made frozen drinks at skybar weren't that great according to my friends.  One had the pina colada, which she said didn't taste anything like pina colada.  Tasted like frozen nasty alcohol.  My other friend had the strawberry daiquiri, which she ended up returning to the bar after 2 sips.  The bartender was nice enough to change it to a better tasting drink that's on the rocks instead of being frozen.  I don't really know whether to recommend this place to a friend, I guess I will if it's their first time.  Otherwise, I probably won't go up to skybar.  Also, they charge an $8 cover.\n\nAnyway, we couldn't hear the music, so we decided to go down to Diesel after about 10-15 mins at skybar.  Diesel had more people and definitely more fun than skybar.
0;The store is dirty, but much worse, the folks at the registers seem to be trained to be rude, and have the social skills of a grocery bag.  I live less than a mile away and was excited to find a Sprouts in my new neighborhood.  After the first few times there, I stopped going and drive well past this store to others.  Recently, I needed some organic tomatoes quickly and so, I thought I would give this Sprouts another try. The girl behind the register never spoke to me and seemed as if it was a real inconvenience to ring up four tomatoes. She practically threw my change and receipt at me.  Never again.  Five or six times of poor service is enough.
1;Place way over priced
4;The piano bar is awesome!!! All I have to say is these guys r hilarious! Upbeat and straight up entertaining!! This is very delayed. I was here 2/13/11. Wrote it while I was still at the bar and just haven't been on here in a while to post it.
1;"This restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness.  However, the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back.  My friend and I spent about $10 each for one of the family dinners...and let me tell you, it was an enormous amount of food!  It even included a whole lobster, which was really tasty.  You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.\n\nHowever, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.\n\nHonestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh \""geo ducks\"" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness."
1;We finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed. There wasn't alot to choose from and it's quite expensive. The service was fine and the food was pretty decent but we expected a very different menu and a larger one at that. Plus their prices were way too much. I doubt we'd be back.
2;The chicken shwarma, kaftta and hommus deluxe are excellent. The garlic sauce is so good I want to drink it. Can you smell my breath from here?\nAwesome staff and a cool store in the back. Try the cookies and the baklava, they're delicious.
0;Twice we ordered take out as Rosati's isn't far from our house and we had guests. Both times they lost our order, the 1st time we weren't told this until after we paid!!  The second time we called and mentioned the problem to avoid a repeat missed order, and they did it again! lol!  \nAnd both times it took well over 30 minutes to get our order and on second time the order wasn't complete and that took 10 more minutes to fix!\nWhat's the saying......'fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?'  We haven't been back since!   And btw, the food wasn't anything special!
2;Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated chilled dessert market. The iced cream is made right in front of you with subtle variations on your classic flavors. This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\n\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\n\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\n\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK.
1;I was born really close to the Mexican border so when I heard this was the best Mexican place in town, naturally I had to act fast.\n\nIt's located centrally which is pretty nice - not in the best neighborhood, but easy access to the freeway.\n\nI should've known that this place was going to be a disaster from they're chips and salsa. One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. \n\nWhen our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre. The beans were too salty, and the meat was under-seasoned. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a sit down joint, but you can honestly get better food a Roberto's. Skip this one!
1;"Brown rice is MUSH!  Today was the second time I've been since my office moved a block away.  I gave it another chance because there is no way a place like this would over cook their rice to the point where it practically melted together....think again.  I have been to Samurai Sams a million times over the years for the \""healthy alternative\"" to fast food and either something has changed to the quality of food or I've been there too many times that I'm burned out.  The rice issue is huge...who wants mushy rice?  Like someone said in reviews below-everything is now premade just sitting there.  Not sure how true that is but thats what it seems.  Big bummer. :("
2;If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant.
4;Great customer service and well priced rentals. Good advice on trails to take and local sites to see. My buddy got a puncture (complete with sunstroke) and a member of the team came out to meet us and replace the tire.
1;"The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \n\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \n\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \n\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \n\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \n\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\n\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \""eh\"" \n\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \n\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\n\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \n\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \""THE BEST\"" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \n\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \n\nFor the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \""Restaurant Stakeout\"" if you find your patronage decline."
3;The first impression was a good one.  The host led us to our table and I couldn't help but notice the murals of Aztec leaders and ancient designs painted on the walls.  The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.  \n\nThe salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.\n\nThe ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town.
2;The husband and I wanted to hit up a few good buffets during our stay. We received mixed reviews for the Wynn buffet, but found it easy to eat at since we were going to watch le reve. After standing in line for about 20 mins (on a Tuesday around 7pm) we were seated. The entry way is gorg but lead back the buffet area the decor seemed a bit outdated, but still very nice.\n\nThe food experience - I just didn't find anything special. The food is all good, but nothing was drool worthy.  They have salads, american, Italian, grilled foods, ramen station, asian and seafood. It was a great variety, but like I said nothing stood out. My favorite was the dessert bar. It had a good variety.
4;Massage, massage!! I am visiting from out of town and wanted a massage. They were great on getting my sceduled in on last minute. I had a neck and shoulder massage from Lawerence and i highly recommend him! I typically dont like massages because I just don't have luck with finding someone good. He was great and will come back when I visit again!
3;"This review is not about the food but the slamming ultra lounge that is The Cathouse.\n\nIf you like house music in a less crowded atmosphere where you can actually socialize with people, this is the lounge for you.\n\nDrinks are very fairly priced.  Hostesses are very professional delivering incredible service (yeah they are also hot but this is not one of those clubs).\n\nMake some local friends and get in without cover.\n\nCheck the Luxor website before you head out to the lounge.  There are different themes during the week including a hip-hop and an \""alternative lifestyle\"" night."
3;After 24 hours on the Strip, you need to get away. A 15-minute drive out to an anonymous, deserted strip mall on W. Sahara you'll find Rosemary's, whose food can compete bite-for-bite w/ the Michelin 1- and 2-star restaurants at the resorts. We deferred to the prix fixe menus and were not disappointed!
3;I saw Keith Urban and LIttle Big Town recently, this was my first concert since moving to Phoenix. I've seen Keith up close before and to save money we chose lawn seats, the sound was great, he played in the center for several songs giving us a close up performance, his lighting and video behind the stage was super. i agree the concessions/beer prices are ridiculous but I wasn't surprised. It was a perfect night weather wise, it did run late and we left a few minutes earlier than he stopped performing.\nI do recommend exiting the I 10 before 83rd, that's where all the traffic was. I will arrive earlier to get a better lawn seat but we had a great time, in fact will be there for Jason Aldean the 17th! For $30 sitting in my own chair in the lawn under the stars is worth it.
1;I used to love this place. So much so, that I gave them several chances to remind me of that long lost love affair. Last 3 out of 3 times has been terrible. My hot and sour soup came to me about the color of mustard. And it was sickeningly sweet. My fried wontons were virtually meatless, and my combo fried rice didn't have any discerning flavor at all. $20 later and all i can say is that I'm so disappointed.  I will never order from them again. I will stick with Red House for my wonton fix and continue to search for a go to place for fried rice.
0;Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat
3;One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.\n\nIt's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha) \n\nWeds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each
3;It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good.
2;Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere \n\nI make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months. The food is average and overpriced. The service is OK. And there is usually one good Pale Ale on tap and overpriced. \n\nIt is kinda like going to Disneyland. You know you are going to take in the shorts but you go anyway. You go to live the dream if only for an hour or two. \n\nIf you ever went fishing as a kid or wished you had,  grab your wallet or purse and eat here asap.
1;Horrible happy hour martinis - unless you like pure sugar syrup. Food is not much better. Would not recommend it.
0;I made appointment prior to coming here but still waited for an hour. The place is nice but looks can be deceiving because of the bad service they provided me. Please don't waste your time coming here totally not worth the wait!!!
0;I just had a late lunch. The all you can eat sushi was not worth it. The food was not fresh. It was horrible!!! I've been here quite a few times but I don't remember the food tasting like this. First of all, the edamame was not eatable. I couldn't even get the peas out of the pods. The chicken skewers were dried and had a weird smell with it. Perhaps the meat was sitting out too long?? The sushi items we ate didn't taste fresh. Especially the tuna. We also ordered the green mussels which was burnt and ruin the rest of my appetite. Overall for lunch I should of starve.
0;Totally avoid this place. Spend a few more $$s and go to the one at Bellagio but do so after 12noon as the Japenese and Italian stations do not open until then. The food at Flavor lacked flavor completely. It must take some effort to make simple dishes taste so bad!
3;"Breakfast to die for!!!\n\nMy wife and I got in late, and woke up the next day hungry. We wanted breakfast so I yelp for local places.  We have tried Hash House a Go Go, great place when not watching your calories.  I saw other places with comments $40 for breakfast ya da, ya da.  We were staying in the Venezia tower and had eaten at Bouchon's before. \n\n I noticed that Bouchon served breakfast so I was game.  I was not disappointed.  French pastry's, European coffee, what could be better.\n\nI ordered the omelet of the day, stuffed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and cheese.  Perfect eggs, good sausage, with brioche toast.\n\nMy wife had the bread pudding French toast with warm Carmel vanilla sauce. \""Heaven on a plate\"" according to my wife.  \n\nThe service was great, and for the strip, and an upscale restaurant the $38 dollar breakfast was another great moment.\n\nIf you stay anywhere near this place it is a must try for breakfast."
2;They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing.
0;Disorganized. Ripoffs. Rude, airhead employees that don't clean and freely talk on there cell phones whilst you asking them a simple question. Id rather rub sand in my eyes. Disgusted.
3;Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo
4;I should have reviewed this place long ago but I was too busy eating there to take the time to sit down and write. \n\nWe have been going here since they opened, first enticed in by a Groupon and then brought back by Chef Steve's wonderfully inspired dishes. This is a small plates restaurant so do not order one plate and expect to be full. The menu is divided into individual proteins and veggies. Read the descriptions carefully and then order enough to share. My husband and I typically order four or five plates and then hesitate over dessert. Chef Steve did a menu change recently so now we will be enjoying some new items and hope that you also try them out. Go with a group of people, its more fun\n\nThe Poke is one of my favorites, but make sure you mix it to get the seasoning all through it. One the new new additions is the Beef Carpaccio, Very flavorful. Also the shrimp dish, I believe its called Mini Mi's but its on a bun with slaw. The slaw is so good I would eat just that. They are so many dishes that it is truly had to remember. Checkout their ode to the Monte Cristo, it will make you weep. The owners work hard to provide good service and are always looking to improve. So.....if you want to eat and not be bothered go for lunch during the day. If you want busy with some music and noise check them out on a Friday night. They have a Facebook page that will tell you if there is something going on before you head out. Since I am all about the food, we go during the daytime. They also apparently have a happy hour but I don't know what that is about, I have just read the sign.\n\nThe decor is very basic, as is the plating and utensils. Because we have been coming here since the beginning, we have been able to see the changes they have made to the place over time. I can see where they have spent their money and am able to understand their choices. I would much rather have great food than great decor.
4;"I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!\n\nI've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)\n\nI'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their \""Miso Hungry Salmon.\""  \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!\n\nIf this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!"
0;"Seemingly popular with the 20-somethings with long lines in the evening, we stopped in BurGR for a late lunch and it seems GR is living on his celebrity, not his cooking or service.  It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.  Don't use the excuse \""it's Vegas, Baby.\""   Ramsay is there to take your money.  I think I'm older and more experienced at decent dining than many of the reviewers for this place.  Note the reviews that say they are fans of Ramsay - doesn't have a thing to do with the food actually served - and I assure you - Ramsay didn't cook these things."
1;While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back.
3;I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  \n\nThe ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. \n\nThe place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.\n\nI went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning.
1;"Very Trendy hotel!!!  \n\nA friend was able to get me a free room for my birthday!   Thanks KJ!  :-)\n\nThe check in process was LONG-even in VIP, however I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free...\n\nThe room was cute and clean.   I enjoyed the views from the wraparound terrace.\n\nRoom service was GREAT!!!  \n\nI asked the bartender at the vesper bar  to  Surprise me with a drink that was fruity yet would still give me a buzz, she hooked me up with a SAGE 75!!!   Let's just say I enjoyed it to the fullest!!!  \n\nShopping in the hotel  left something to be desired.   \n\nI don't think I'll stay here again, however it was nice to experience it -  especially since it was free!  ;-)"
0;I am a big fun of French food and patisserie, I used to go to that  place 3 times a week for breakfast or lunch, but everything change there during this last year, I order Marquez, and they serve it to me almost burned, u cannot taste any thing.  \nLast Sunday I was there they close at 4pm, I was there  at 3pm, and I want to order omelet, the server there she told me the kitchen is close, we can't cook anything, come on!!\nI had many bad experiences there, I will never go back, there are many other French bakery in vegas
3;Cheap, cheap eats! Really great breakfast and service. The bloody mary was delish and for only $5, it packed a wallop for the small glass.
1;"Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!"
4;No special request is too special for John.  Even a soy allergy can be handled in this awesome sushi restaurant.  Don't eat shell fish, but still want sushi?  No problem.  John's is the best hands down.
1;Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside.
3;I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come.\nI ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side.\nThe server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy.
2;On our recent one day trip to las vegas we decided to have dinner at this place since we were residing far from the strip blvrd. The menu was very interesting and very confusing, So I let the other order. My favorite was pieces of salmon, and the one with the quail egg.\nIn general the service was really good, super friendly and very fast. Fish was very fresh.
3;Horrible food (except the garlic bread, that was actually pretty good!).  It's annoying that they only take cash, I feel like this is 1995 again.   It's also annoying you have to go to two sections to order your drinks, you can't order them with your meal.\n\nHOWEVER, it's cheap entertainment.   Have a little kid? Spend $25, take the family here, they will enjoy it.
2;My husband and I finally checked out this place after hearing about it only a couple weeks ago.  The idea of a cute storefront restaurant on Main Street intrigued us.  We went on a weeknight and found the place surprisingly full - there were only five (of about 15-20) tables available when we arrived.  However, we were quickly seated and provided with our requested drinks.\n\nWe had pork bellies and kale chips for our appetizers.  The pork bellies were divine.  The kale chips were a bit lacking in flair.  It was basically dry kale with paprika sprinkled on top.  Not much else.\n\nMy husband got the Local Dish burger and declared it good.  The fries he got on the side were great.  I ordered their chicken & peaches sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I could have eaten more than the serving they gave me.  The chicken sandwich was average - but I loved knowing I was probably eating peaches from just a few blocks away at the Peach Stand.  The chicken itself was a bit dry but was helped by the pesto, spinach and peaches that came on it.\n\nWhy did I not give it more than 3 stars?  Because a second visit will be required, with other foods tried, before I decide to bump it up to four stars.  The restaurant was charming enough (and prices decent enough) that we'll most likely go back again the future.
4;My favorite thing about Stalzy's is that they stick to the basics but they do them really well. The menu may not sound super impressive in comparison to the prices but when you get your meal the quality is superb. These sandwiches are made with quality, local ingredients and with the above average drink selection they really provide the deli experience I expect. Dont let the simple titles fool you this top notch food is worth of your lunch(or breakfast) hour any day.\n\nMy sandwich of choice is the ham and swiss, simple, delectable, delicious :)
3;My wife and I had dinner there last night. It was superb. \nDon!t know what people are talking about regarding  nachos and sangria.\nThis is totally good French food. The ambiance, the decor, the food presentation were all in keeping with what a high level restaurant should be. The restaurant was not very busy as it was relatively early evening\nSo the waiter did not rush the servings along enabling us to dine at\nOur own pace. Our prize fixe meal was $47each plus wine, tax, and tip\nThe three course meal consisted of a lovely green salad, the entree was salmon for me that was cooked perfectly served with what appeared to be roasted barley mix and green beans. My wife has a veal chop that she liked but what I thought was a little too rare on the inside although\nWell charred on the outside. Desert was a glorious crime de br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was to die for. \nIn summary we both thought it was a good dining experience and a good value for the price.\nWe would go back again and recommend to friends.
3;Went here on a Friday night around nine and was sat right away. I chose the Chilean sea bass and my dinner companions chose the bone in ribeye and the new your strip. After sampling everything I would have to say the ribeye was the best. We also tried their oyster Rockefeller and it was delicious!
1;They are a nice alternative to Zimbrick in Madison is you have a foreign car.  However I would recommend Zimbrick as the mechanics at Zimbrick will tell you what items you can do yourself to save money.  Look out at Dunn's as they may try to add on additional services that you don't really need which will cost you more money.
4;"Up there with Crave for a classy bar with good, expensive martinis.  Nice, modern lighting, the atmosphere makes me feel fabulous.....who am I kidding, I am fabulous!  There's always a cute boy around to by me a drink, so the prices don't bother me too much.  Their \""one & done\"" drinks knock my socks off.....heed the warning that the name gives....I'm serious.....brings me back to my jungle juice days at house parties.  5 stars!"
0;Negative baristas heaven forgive they mess up your order and u ask them to remake it. No asking if it was right the second time, still not right but they are so rude ur afraid to ask for them to actually try it again. Also soooo sloooooooowww come on people drink some coffee and get motivated... lets work on niceness and speed.
2;This place was okay, I wasn't too impressed. The neighborhood is great, but I didn't feel like the coffee shop was anything special. There isn't a lot of table space, so it's hard to do work.\n\nThe drinks were good, though. Seemed to be mostly fair priced. \n\nLike I said, it was good, but nothing special. I may or may not come back.
4;Awesome! We're from la and this was a treat! Chicken del sol was awesome!  Go here there's something healthy and delecious for everyone!
1;First time at Extreme Pita.  It is a little different than Pita Pit. I had the small smoked turkey and my husband had the buffalo chick.  Was not impressed with the food nor the staff. Not sure we will go back.
4;I love both locations equally. Such a delicious cafe caramel. I also really love their tea selections. The baristas are always friendly, and there's always a place to sit. What more can you ask for? :)
3;Went here with my roommate last week for a late breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! I got the Eggs Benedict and a chocolate croissant while my roommate went for the French toast with fresh fruit. Everything was very tasty, although my roommate could have easily handled a larger portion. \nAll the employees were super sweet and the French owner's eclectic playlist really added to how much I enjoyed the experience. Will have to go again for lunch or dinner!
3;I recently brough my car up to Edinburgh from home, where it had sat on the drive pretty much since I had left home to go to university.\n\nAs I'm sure you can imagine, it was pretty filthy, so I pulled up here expecting to shell out \u00a35 or so for a crappy was that wouldnt really be that great.\n\nNeedless to say, when I realised that the cheapest was was \u00a32, i was suprised and I was even more suprised when the car came out looking like a million dollars.\n\nVery impressive for \u00a32, but thier prices can go up to around \u00a36 - which I'm sure must involve so many polishes and waxes and cleans that dirt must be simply repelled from the body of your car, never getting dirty again.
3;Always enjoy our visits to RA. Our party of six arrived early afternoon. The restaurant was fairly slow,  we were seated quickly and greeted very friendly by Tiffany. \n\nWe ordered edamame, steamed and RA chips and salsa (tuna tartar with salsa and avocado served with wonton chips). \n\nWe were unsure of what to drink and Tiffany recommended White Sake Sangria. What a great recommendation!\n\nOur group shared udon noodles, Las Vegas roll, crispy tuna roll and two California rolls for the kids. \n\nWe really enjoy the atmosphere and grooving music to dance to with the kids!  Each meal is really fun because we mix it up and don't go in with any preconceived notions and our kids love it.
0;I WILL NEVER USE VEGAS.COM OR STAY AT CAESARS\nWe were booked to stay here 7/3 for 2 nights & left after the 1st. The bathroom fixtures were rusted, the bottom of the door was broken & coming apart, urine had ate away at the marble around the toilet the grout around the tub was dirty & moldy. The other doors were 1.5 inches from reaching the floor, we could see out into the hall & into the adjoining room. the air conditioner was very clanking. They sent someone to fix it which was no help. They switched our room to an nicer room that had 1/2 the crystals stolen off the wall sconce chandelier. The blanket had a big hole in it & the lighting was too dim to apply my make-up. We asked where the buffet was & they said it had been closed for month & vegas.com should have told us & they didn't. They suggested we go to Flamingo's buffet which was closed for 4 hours due to a water problem. We then walked to Paris who's buffet was open but were out of food. No meat, no fresh cooked veggies. The salad bar was old wilted lettuce with no tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes or other fresh veggies. At least the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian was outstanding. I will never stay at Caesars and never book from Vegas.com & will tell everyone i know to avoid both of these when booking a Vegas get away
2;I would have paid ten dollars more per entree if it would have been a little bit better. The duck was excellent but my husband's lamb was kind of disappointing.  The server got a little snooty when we ordered water instead of drinks.  Don't get me wrong-- the duck reallywas tastey, but it looked like the best meal there.
4;"This event was broken into two parts. The first was a walking tour of Bloomfield courtesy of Burgh Bits & Bites and the second was a beer tasting at Church Brew Works courtesy of Jake of PA Brew Tours.\n\nRichard and Sylvia from Burgh, Bits and Bites Tours were absolutely great! I never knew Bloomfield was so interesting and had so much history and I've lived in the Pittsburgh area my whole life. LOL! The walking tour consisted of the following stops, Angelo's Pizzeria, Groceria Italia, Merante's Gifts and Donateli's. While on the tour we learned about the different architecture of the area including dental crown molding and the beautiful St. Joseph's Church.\n\nThe first stop, Angelo's Pizzeria served us some delicious cheese pizza. (I will be back soon!) \n\nThe second stop, Groceria Italia a cute little Italian grocery store that has been in the neighborhood for decades was my favorite stop. The fact that they make all of their pasta, sausages and meats by hand is a plus during a time when most things are made by machines. While there we got to meet \""Momma\"" and sample some homemade meatballs and pasta, outstanding!\n \nThe third stop, Merante's Gifts is a cozy little store that sells Italian among other home decor items. It's the perfect store to find trinkets for your Nana. Maria, the owner who also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs served us some tasty iced coffee in the kitchen where she does her classes. We also each got a amazing dessert while back in the gift shop.\n\nThe fourth and final stop of the walking tour was Donateli's, a Italian grocery store similar to Groceria Italia. The main difference between the two is that Donateli's pasta is not homemade and is supplied from another company. While there we got to try a orange and chocolate biscotti and see the \""back of house\"" machines.\n\nThe Brewery portion was nice also. We got to sample three different beers. I don't drink beer so I can't really say they were all that good. Jake really knows the history of beer in Pittsburgh. The only bad thing that happened was the shuttle bus that dropped us off at Church Brew Works left us stranded and we had to wait for him to come back. Not Jake's fault.\n\nThanks Rachel for another great event."
0;"Sometimes there really needs to be a \""no star\"" option. Or maybe a \""it was so bad they owe me some damn stars\"" choice. But there isn't so I'll go with a one-star review and I'll add a caveat of \""how shitty do you want to be treated?\""\n\nIt's time for Jim to get a new company car. We're excited about this because we tire of driving around in a gas-hog. And Jim is particularly optimistic about a new car because they put a jeep on the list. Now granted, it's not the rubicon of his dreams but it is a \""better mileage\"" jeep and that's a start.\n\nSo we went over to Superstition Springs Jeep because they had a number of the specific model on the lot. He wanted to test drive all the choices and decide which car to order.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by four salesmen. Jim told them why we were there. As soon as they realized his was to be a fleet purchase they blew us off. They pointed at a group of cars and went under a tree to smoke. We did take a look, not really believing that they actually blew us off like that, but of course all but a couple base models were locked up tight.\n\nWe went inside, still hoping to pull this time-waster out of the craper, and Jim went over to the sales manager. He explained what we wanted and what we'd experienced so far. He made clear that being blown off was unacceptable. The manager mumbled something mildly apologetic and walked off. Jim went in search of a fleet person. \n\nWhen the manager came back he asked me for the name of my husband's company. I told him and he responded that fleet orders go directly to the factory. The implication was that we couldn't expect anyone to help us because there was nothing in it for them.\n\nI told the manager that I considered it a mistake because you never know who you're dealing with. I told him that I might be in the market for a new car in six or eight months (which is true if certain events come to pass) and that I certainly wouldn't buy it anyplace that I was treated so rudely.\n\nThe manager looked at me and told me that if that's the way I felt I should go find another dealership to test drive a jeep.\n\nLet me repeat that, just in case you missed it. We were treated rudely and when we objected we were told to leave. \n\nI think the manager was hoping to intimidate me. At least it seemed that way from the way he towered over me, hands on hips, scowling. But I looked at him, smiled and told him he was absolutely right. I called to Jim, told him what the manager said, and we left.\n\nI have to say I am impressed by a company whose commission-only business philosophy involves alienating your customer. Especially since Jim's good sized fleet has to be serviced somewhere and the service department generates a huge amount of the dealership income.\n\nSuffice it to say we were treated much better elsewhere. We won't be back."
4;"If they had Electric Six's \""Gay Bar\"" I would be tempted to play it every time I came. All wise cracks aside and the frequent mentions that this is a gay bar. The Garage is a place that transcends the need to be labeled and is just fun for everyone. No matter if you are GLBT or straight. When the urge to go hang out at a cool bar with cheap drinks, clean facilities, an abundance of games, friendly bartenders, and sports playing on all the TV, this will always be the first choice. You would think it would be difficult to get a bunch of straight guys into this place, but there is never a need to convince them, because it is not a place where people go trolling. \n\nMonday nights are board shorts night offering $1 well drinks and domestic drafts from 9 to midnight. I guess having the cheapest happy hour in town is not enough."
4;Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well.
2;Pros: \n-open 24hrs\n-organized waiting list\n-clean for a pho place\n-quick, but crap service(typical of viet places)\n-the pho helped my hangover\n\n\nCons:\n-crap service\n-meh pho\n-8 bucks for pho\n-smaller portions than other pho joints I've been to\n\nOverall, it's a pretty mediocre place. If you're in Vegas and have a pho craving, it will do. But just don't expect it to do that much.
1;Standing room on the side balconies was waaaaaay over packed. We paid big bucks to see Muse and could barely see them at times. They really over sold this show.
4;Deeelicious!  The first time my wife and I went here, we were amazed at how NOT busy it was.  Every restaurant in the Phoenix area seems to be constantly busy - every day - but not this one!  Each time we have been here, we have either been the only people in the place or one of only 2 occupied tables!  Weird!  We asked our server about this and were told they do a lot of take-out business.  We have noticed this to be true on our visits.  Ok - on to the food.  We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!  I would agree that the salads are good - I generally get the side house salad with ranch dressing.  It is always fresh and crisp with lots of veggies.  All-in-all we will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant!
3;Big chains are important to submit reviews for.\nEven though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.\n\nThis Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.  \n\nFood is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.  \nThere seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc. \nThey do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what. \n\nBreakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.\n\nI can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.\n\nInside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.  \n\nYou kids get the hell off my lawn.
4;"Great, fresh food and excellent service. They never disappoint. A perfect place to be a \""regular\"". They always remember what we like to eat and serve with a smile."
1;Watch out!  This place has undergone a SERIOUS change.  \n\nI decided to have a nice steak dinner.  I wanted something slightly upscale but local.  Of course I jumped on Yelp and went searching.  A friend had mentioned Onyx before so I looked it up.   Good reviews... and a special coupon to purchase.  $30 off for $15 seemed like a great deal so I bought it right here on Yelp and off I went to Onyx.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place seemed TOO quiet.  We parked right up front, across form the door, and in the shade.  We walked and turned away from the bar into the upscale Onyx.  YIKES!  Gone are the tablecloths, waiters, and customers.  We are greeted by the bartender who cautions us that they have a new menu.  I ask, is this still Onyx?  He replies that it is but cautions me that the menu is much smaller and I might have trouble spending the $30 on my coupon.  Uh oh.  I thought about leaving, but I am already $15 invested into this meal.  \n\nNo more steaks or even entrees.  The menu consists of appetizers, pizza's, and sandwiches.  We order the crispy taco appetizer and onion soup to start.  The tacos were good... they should be as it took them 20 minutes to make.  The onion soup never came at all.  Then onto the main course.  We both order pizza's.  After a good 30 minutes....  THIRTY MINUTES....   the food arrives.  A word of warning...  if you order pizza here you better like parmigiana.  The pizza was LOADED with it.  It was really 90% of the taste.  The crust and sauce were OK... but they were overpowered.  Even if you love parmigiana, you are likely to be disappointed in the pizza.  They couldn't sell this in NY for a nickel.  \n\nOverall the food was disappointing and the atmosphere depressing.  No more live music.  No more tablecloths.  No more restaurant... really.  I guess they couldn't make it as a real restaurant and now are some sort of  cheap poker bar menu... but without the poker bar (unless you go to the other room... bogeys).  Honestly, I don't know why the owner just doesn't make one big poker bar.  The Onyx is dead folks.  Move along...  nothing to see here.
2;Just tried this place out yesterday as I've been looking for a good Chinese buffet in the area. I just moved here a few months ago and wanted to compare it to places back home. I'm giving a solid 3 stars.\n\nThis is probably the largest Chinese buffet I've been to. You pay upfront, so our lunch for 2 cost just over $22 with drinks, not including tip. Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks). \n\n\nMy favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\n\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \n\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \n\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine. \n\nI rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills. Other than that, it was pretty mediocre. I've been to way better Chinese buffets back home in Illinois, so it's nothing too special for my taste buds.
0;Used to be my hobby store of choice.  I bought several RC cars and parts from them.  I have also referred people there to buy drones and RC cars.  I now cannot recommend Hobby Action.  Must be under a lot of pressure these days.  Customer service is now nonexistent and if you are a novice forget about it..  Yes, they have a lot of parts but their customer service is horrible.  Spoke to the owner about it today and his favorite word is policy and he was raising his voice at me.  Not customer friendly..  I walked out and will never be back.  Several other stores understand how to treat a loyal customer.
3;I have been enjoying the massages with hot rocks and great service for over a year now and yes, I'm a fan. My last visit I tried a gel manicure and now I'm a convert. The manicure I received 9 days ago, still looks pristine, shiny. The application process is more involved and takes a little longer that the standard manicure but for only 10 dollars more - it is so worth it.
0;Went there two times...totally disappointed. Super over price, food sucks especially the sushi, not many choices...totally dun worth $35 per person! Dun go here... go wicked spoon at cosmopolitan. Brunch only $22. Nice place, good food, many choices.
0;I don't review places often, but felt in this situation this place needed to be placed back in reality. Yes, they do display fun designs on instagram and overall seem to have a pretty good review, I am just going off of my experience. I had a scheduled trip home for the holidays and decided to give this place a shot. For one it was not relaxing and the two woman working near me were talking amongst themselves about the other female customer (of course not in english). Pedicure did not even come close to what you would get at any other salon. I still had dry skin and it wasn't a relaxing, massage experience I was expecting. The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day. A regular pedicure and gel manicure cost me $93 plus $10 tip with Winnie. Not my style. Will never go back. Horrible management. Good luck!
0;"Well, the extra star is really for the fact that I love our front-loader washer and dryer and that they were on sale. Didn't go to our regular Lowe's (Ray Rd) as they didn't have the models in stock. Absolutely disgusted and appalled at their customer service or lack thereof when it came to the delivery and installation. We were told they would call us Saturday morning to confirm our delivery slot. To err on the side of caution, we even called to confirm Friday night. Three phone calls later on Saturday morning, we come to find out that our order isn't even ON THE TRUCK! Seriously?! To add insult to injury, the \""manager\""  (I use this term loosely),had the audacity to ask if he could deliver it tomorrow! Absolutely unreal. So it's now noon, we still don't have our new appliances nor any idea of when they will be delivered. What an absolute joke and waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Thanks Lowe's, just how I wanted to spend my weekend, waiting for you jokers to get your crap together. Thumbs down!!!! Do not recommend the Chandler Road to anyone! We have always been very loyal to Lowe's and this seriously makes me think about switching our alliances to home depot!"
4;Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school. But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  \n\nOverall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte.
3;Nice layout of the casino. Lots of slot machines that aren't in other casinos. Like Yahtzee. The bathrooms are clean as well. Lots of delicious eaterys. The convention rooms are expansive and the halls have comfortable seating thru out.
1;"\""One Of My Least Favorite\""\nI generally aim for the more upscale casino's to not only gamble at but to also stay inside the hotel as well. I find these type of low budget casinos to be a bit past outdated and I guess for anybody who is on a budget that likes ancient egyptian theme's should opt for the Luxor!"
0;Every time I purchase a groupon from Danny's Car Wash there seems to be a technical glitch.  This time I came in with one of the receipts/vouchers generated by Danny's when I turned in my groupon certificate.  They said the car wash had already been used.  Really?  How could i have used it multiple times if you generate the ticket from your register?  To top it off, I always have to go back through and have them vaccuum the car a second time and touch up spots they miss when wiping down the interior of the car. I'm not talking about hidden spots!  I'm talking about lifting the floor mats and getting ALL of the dirt under them.  Or really cleaning the interior coffee mug holders that have obvious coffee cup stains.  I am on the hunt for a new car wash in North Scottsdale.
3;"We stopped for a late night dinner at the Great Dane Brew Pub on our way to Chicago. It had a nice atmosphere; I could definitely see us spending a lot of time here if we lived in the area. I am not a beer drinker but I did love their root beer. My husband *loves* beer and really enjoyed all of the ones that he tried.  My pot pie was delicious and my husband's burger was really good. If we ever find ourselves in the area again we would go back for sure."
4;Fresh ingredients, good service, wonderful favors. Simple concept that works. Wife had phenomenal turkey sandwich' I had great French toast friends had roast beef sandwich and an appetizer cheese plate with something else that I missed.  If you are a person that likes a huge stack of pancakes, with four eggs and bunch of bacon as a minimum for breakfast this is wrong for you.  The portions are modest but filling for me.  This is about the taste not the poundage.\nWe went for brunch and my screwdriver had fresh squeezed OJ    The Bloody Mary's  Were great   Oh and split an order of fries.  Not a lot of tables but lots of space at bar.  And it is expensive.  But there are other expensive breakfast spots in the area that have disappointed me.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Best thing about our brunch was no adults brought their awful  obnoxious horrible children  So nice to have quiet adults.  I have children in their 20s. I never took them anywhere before they could behave.  I can't wait for my grandchildren to b  here. But they will be polite before they go to a restaurant.  This has nothing to do with cafe bink.  Everything to do with civility   Your child or grandchild is hideous.  Leave them at home when they visit from Minnesota   They suck. Seriously. Everyone hated them on the flight also.  And your wife /daughter whatever is fat and making excuses for not parenting
0;0 STARS. This dairy queen is horrible. The employees do not know how to do their job. Completely disorganized and not clean. It took three employees to ring my order up. Corporate needs to review this shit hole of a store.
4;Walked in at 3:30PM on Friday to see if they could fix a failed network component external power supply that appeared to have bad capacitors.\n\nAfter the gentleman at the ERC front desk popped the cover open and looked at what they were dealing with I was quoted a reasonable price for them to try to fix it and asked if I wanted to leave it with them or wait. I decided to wait.\n\nERC fixed the power supply by replacing capacitors and had me back out the door in about 25 minutes on a Friday. I was able to get back to my office in time to install the repaired power supply on the network device without any interruption to the start of my weekend.\n\nI will definitely be giving ERC my business for these types of repairs in the future. If they can fix it it's cheaper, faster and easier than used/refurb parts from eBay or unknown internet vendors and hoping the item is as described.
1;Food is average, but the ordering process is absolutely terrible. Technology gone wrong. Doubt I'll be back
4;This Indonesian food cart is AMAZING.  Not only one of my favorite food carts, but easily one of the top lunch options in the entire city in my opinion.  Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\n\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\n\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\n\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \n\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.  I am *racking* my brain and I cannot think of a single reason to not send ALL of you here.  Seriously, just go.  You won't regret it!
0;Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable.
3;"The only problem with our Saturday in Montreal is that by 6 p.m., we'd caved to the temptation of a great breakfast, steak frites lunch and afternoon cocktails and snacks.  For us, Le Sarah B was the perfect stop for the evening \""meal\"" - Rose and chicken wings!    Those wonderful chicken wings, perfectly seasoned and fried.  Recommended seating is around the corner behind the curtains - banquettes and pillows invite one to respectably sluggardize.  Bok bok!"
0;"Went to get my dog's food at the Pet Food Depot (Cave Creek/Grovers) and I saw a bunny in a cage on the floor, scared. He/she had food and a carrot but no water. I told an employee and after a bunch of \""that's not my rabbit\"" comments, finally someone gave the bunny water. The sweet young man who checked me out told the manager that a customer wanted to buy 2 parakeets. The manager said to put them in a paper bag because they're out of boxes...really, a paper bag? The young man said the customer specifically wanted the birds in a box and the manager said \""we don't have any boxes, should I grab one from the sky\"" and walked off. What a huge turn-off! I found out that the manager is the owner's son. \nI have been coming here for 8 years and this was my last trip here. There is a store a little further away (Western Ranchman at 32nd St/Paradise) that sells the same specialty dog food I buy, so they will be getting my business from now on. I have always been treated well here but after the flippant comments from the staff in front of a loyal customer, they obviously do not care about me or the animals they sell."
1;"Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers \""oh that guy is mad at me\"", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional."
2;"Gotta give Sparky some credit for their free bumper stickers, \""Stop staring at my cones\"" Well I didn't get a cone, but I still tried a cup of ice cream. I guess I thought since it said Gourmet, I didn't realize that the place is really just a Stone-Cold with a bit fancier ice cream. I sampled Brown Sugar Maple Bacon, but didn't taste much and German Choc. cake was only Ok. Finally settled on a pretty decent scoop of cinnamon ice fream with two mixin's ($5...one was free and the other cost me an extra $1 because I donated for holidays). The chocolate chips and chopped pecans made this a tasty treat, but the best ice cream on the planet usually does not include mixing stuff into the treat. It's just a preference, but yogurt gets the toppings, but ice cream should be ready to go from the bins."
3;I think this place is great. It's a unique little spot. However, some of these reviews are expecting too much. First, you're going for a $10 wine tasting for five wines, you shouldn't expect Opus One. The wines are priced appropriately and the concept of bottling parties is such a great idea for an event. Also, 'carry & go' is a perfect idea in this area. \n\nThe wines are not offensive. If you are a wine connoisseur, then you will appreciate that these are young wines, but typically are pleasing to the palate. \n\nI have always found the staff to be extremely friendly. Also, I agree with Gabbi, that they get props for being doggie friendly!!
0;Not going to explain. Just don't waste your time.
1;This is a neat, unique restaurant, but not one item was worth the price. This restaurant is not fine dining, so to pay six bucks for four onion rings seemed off to me.
2;It's somewhat ok. Seems clean enough. Don't use powder detergent though. At least not on the front loaders the fans blow all the time and that powder will get blown in your face. They need to work on more places to sit too. Not always easy to sit outside when it's hot or you're pregnant and need to get off your feet.
2;It's chilly here - so please where a jacket!  \n\nThe station is going under major refurbishment, so please bear with it.  \n\nIt has a ticket office, toilets and various shops to get any last minute shopping before you hop on that train. \n\nLooking forward to seeing the completion of works.
2;I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't tink they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live. \n\nI also like supporting local Arizona business.\n\nThe staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff.
1;To avoid the pouring rain, we ran into this place to have a drink.  I got a dirty martini and my friend got some fruity drink.  I was unimpressed.  My martini glass was tiny and it was barely halfway full.  There was literally 2 spoonfuls of liquid in that tiny glass.  That would have been okay for $9 if I were surrounded by hot bodies in tight shirts dancing on white sofas.  In which case the goddamn drink woulda been free.  But this ain't Hollywood honey.  When I pay $9 for a drink I expect more than an eyedropper's worth.
0;There are a few issues with this place.\nThe obvious is the entirely unacceptable wait for food. I ordered on GrubHub (which I do often) at 2:18pm, my estimated delivery was 3:45pm-3:55pm\nSeemed a little long but its BBQ and red velvet cake with corn bread and mac n cheese so has to be worth some wait, and I am near a college campus so OK.\n\n4:00pm rolls by and I call the restaurant. At first it goes directly to VM. OK, this isn't good so I call again and I get put on hold. Once the gentlemen finally picks up Im told it will be 15-20 minutes for my order and he apologizes for the delay. OK no problem.\n\nI decide to hop on Yelp and look at the reviews, as when I ordered I was starving so just picked a place (I'm still starving as I write this first part). I see the wait is not uncommon. In fact its the norm.\n\n4:20pm rolls by and I message GrubHub. Within 2 minutes I had a text and email stating I should have my food by 4:32pm ...its 4:29pm as I type this. They gave me an extra 10.00 in food, which I appreciate and realize its not their fault my food is late but with all these issues piling up you would think they might get the hint to discontinue business with this place. (Just sayin).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo food got here at: 4:37\n\n\nReview of food:\n\nHot Links - Sauce was spicy and good so was the hotlink the bun was crunchy on the edges link it was over microwaved.\n\nMac N Cheese - Bland. Its a shame too there is so much you can do with Mac N Cheese.\n\nCornbread Muffin - Decent taste, horrible consistency. I don't expect my Cornbread to be chewy.\n\nRed Velvet Cake - Cake was moist and it was good but it had an after taste like the cream cheese had been wrapped in plastic wrap too long\n\n\nAll in all I wont order here again, the food was not great and the time it took to get here was utterly poor.
2;It wasn't horrible and it wasn't mind-blowing. Average burger with steep prices (well, you are in Vegas). We were really hungry and on our way to the Secret Garden at the Mirage. Limited combo options, if you choose a special burger then the price of the friesa and drink skyrocket the bill. The milkshake was dense and tasty, but half the cup was frosting (which I don't really care for). Simple and clean presentation. The server was timely and attentive. She didn't hover too much or ignore us. I liked the house pickles (mild brine). Honestly, for the price, I would have rather paid for a restaurant experience at a Master Chef restaurant or something.
3;This place is really cool. So many birds. The shows were very interesting as well. The food court has some good pizza too.
4;Super!  When you team Chef Kelly Fletcher with Sommelier David M Johnson you know you're going to experience magic. Achiote Salmon was a great flavor festival in my mouth.  We also tried the braised short rib which as good as we have ever had. Love the creativity of the food and the large (and well priced) wine list. Check it out!!
2;I love whole foods but this location has the basics.  The products and help is the normal 4/5 stars but this is one of the smaller locations I have seen. Their deli still has all the goodies you would expect from whole foods. Still it is better than not having a whole foods at all like most of Wisconsin.
0;Horrible service. Came here with my 13 yr old daughter. Took 30 minutes to get a bowl of garlic fries, almost an hour to get our food. Waitress was more interested in socializing with the tables of loud, obnoxious drunks, than serving a dad and his daughter. Even had to wait to pay my bill. Finally got up and paid my bill at the front desk. Food quality has gone way down since I started coming here a few years ago.
1;4stars to DJ !!! \nI got hyped by the music that DJ played for us.\nHe played songs that are mixed from old funk to pop songs.\nTransition between songs is really smooth. \n\n0 stars for the bar. Cocktails were not worth the price.\n\n(4+0)/2=2 stars
1;My family and I were here staying at a near by Hotel and decided to go here, plus it was my husbands birthday. We got right in for a Saturday night. We ordered the sampler appetizer. This had no flavor. It was so bland. Then my husband ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta. He couldn't even eat it, it was so bland. No spices, no taste. I tried it and I couldn't even eat it. We sent it back. I got the top sirloin and it was basically a piece of fat that had been grilled. The kids didn't even eat their food. (One had chicken fried steak and the other kid ribs) I felt so bad for my husband because he had a terrible birthday dinner meal. We ended up paying our bill, and getting snacks afterwards to compensate. The service was good, but not attentive. We will not ever visit another Claim Jumper again.
3;Took my father here for his birthday and it was quite the experience.  L'atelier is famous for its open kitchen.  They give their guests the option of sitting at the bar where they can overlook the open kitchen and watch all the chefs cooking their food.  My father and I each ordered the Discovery Menu for $168.  Seems a little pricey for a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but hey...it is JR.\n\nThe Discovery Menu consisted of 10 courses (including coffee).  There was a lot of foie gras in the menu that evening and my cholesterol level felt like it was going to rocket out of the building after the meal.  But the foie gras was cooked very well and full of flavor.  I was very impressed with the Langoustine carpaccio.  It was my first time having Langoustine and I really enjoyed it with the combination of spices.  The Dover sole filet wasn't anything too special though.\n\nWe also shared an order of the le'burger, L'atelier's signature burger.  It consisted of a kobe beef patty with foie gras and WOW was that delicious.  The best burger I have ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who visits L'atelier.\n\nThe service was also very good and attentive here.  Always making sure we didn't have an empty glass of water and the waiters are were very willing to make small talk.  Seeing that it was my father's birthday, at the end of the meal they presented us with a selection of 6 different kinds of dessert cakes, all of which were delicious.\n\nThe price is what stopped me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, but my father and I still enjoyed our meal very much.
1;"I would give this \""Urban Grocery\"" a better rating if their hours were better!  Being closed on Sunday and Monday, two of the most common \""oops, I forgot something and need to go to the grocery store\"" days, is not the best idea.  It's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  I'm glad that I can get Hickman's eggs there, but I wish that they used Superstition Farm milk instead of the ubiquitous Shamrock.  SuperFarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  They have an interesting selection of produce, and I realize it's still growing, but we live in AZ so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  Bummer.  They carry some stuff that I will purchase every so now and then like the AZ Cheesecake Co. treats and the bread from Scottsdale, but that's about it."
1;Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.\nNot bad, but for their high prices and the quality, there are better choices in LV.\n\nNoise level is high.
0;Been going to this location for over a year now  Last week i ordered griled chicken breast on rye bread. They brought it to me on regular bun. I noticed human hair on the chicken. Thats gross! I could have a big seen but i didnt in front of his customers.\nToday it was brezzy do i took my mccaw, into store. Ordered the same sandwich as last week again they could not get it right the first time. Then the mgr comes to my table and says my bird cannot be in the store. I told him i wanted my money back. And that i would never return to his resturant  . This owner discrimated against a 2.5 lb animal that brings smiles to countlesss people everyday. He wasnt hurting anybody. \nThis proprietor, was extremely condensending,rude & obnoxious. \nShame on Freedies Custard on Eastern Ave Las Vegas, NV.
3;This Loblaws is good. Avoid peek times because the queues become unbearable.
2;Went there this morning for breakfast. Both the Lox and bagel were delicious but they were very chinsey on lox. Had to order a side of lox where we were given a slice and a quarter for $7. Silly no point!  Should give enough to cover two pieces of a bagel no one makes a sammy. \nThanks
4;"this shop is 100% fantastic!!! \n\nmy friend and i made the trip out from the strip after she raved about the fresh turkey sub she'd had with her husband a year ago. besides some really roundabout directions, the trip was definitely worth the short drive out from the main strip! \nreasons to make your way out to this shop:\n-the turkey is roasted fresh every day and melts in your mouth!\n-during the time we were there, people from NY, Philly, California, and Texas came by, put the philly sandwich to the test, AND loved it!\n-Ruth is one of the sweetest people i met and makes you feel like you're family! \n\nRuth, BEST 12 inches i've ever had!!! ;)"
3;I came to this trendy yet casual restaurant for happy hour (Sun-Fri from 5:30pm - 7:00pm).  To order off the happy hour menu, you have sit at the cocktail tables or the bar.  Because the kitchen is open, you can see the chefs preparing your food, which is always legit.  That being said, I was quite surprised and alarmed to see the chefs eating in the kitchen while preparing the food.  Service was lightning fast, as I was in and out within a half hour.\n\nTime to get happy.\n\nThe white sangria ($5), which also comes in red, was awesome and was so good that I was forced to order another one.\n\nThe raw oysters in a half shell ($2 each) were sold by the half dozen and came with every dipping sauce under the sun.  I've had a lot of oysters in my day and I highly recommend checking these out.\n\nThe stuffed clams ($5) were ginormous.  Stuffed with chorizo, they were served with grilled buttered bread.  The clams were simply amazing.  \nWith just the right amount of salty and savory, they were smooth in texture and easy to chew.\n\nNow for the most expensive appetizer ever.  The poppers ($22) weren't on the happy hour menu and came with 3 tuna balls and 3 yellowtail balls, each served raw on top of fried rice patties.  These bad boys lived up to their name and were small enough to pop in your mouth.  Though not worth the price, they were still pretty dank.\n\nFocus on the seafood at this place and definitely enjoy!
3;I'd like to become a regular here. Especially at the bar. It's well stocked with good liquors and a big selection of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. The bartenders are friendly. The atmosphere is dark and rustic/charming. The patio is intimate with a nice fireplace and heaters with large comfy couches. The food is great, though it takes quite a long time for it to come out after you order it. My boyfriend and I had the burger- moist, perfectly cooked, and with great flavor. We also split the challah french toast. It was very good as well. This place is exactly what I'd like in a neighborhood bar.
4;Loved this place!\n\nI went for lunch after my graduation.  We went for a very late lunch so it was dead, which was fine with me.  We had a great server, who was accomodating and friendly.  The mac and cheese was SO GOOD, definitely get that if you go.  We also had the grilled artichokes.. very yummy.\n\nEveryone's lunch was good, and I thought was really reasonably priced for 5 people (3 ordered the kobe burgers, a bottle of champagne, and two appetizers) when the total came out to $115 bucks.\n\nThey also provided a free celebration dessert, which was such a nice personal touch.\n\nFood = yummy, decor = adorable, service = excellent.
4;I recently needed A/C repair on a Monday morning following the first really\nhot weekend in Phoenix.  Apparently, a LOT of other people needed A/C repair, also.\nMy regular repairman was unavailable.  I called A/C Guys, Inc.  (found on Yelp)\nThis was a rental property.  An appointment needed to be scheduled with the tenant, while keeping me (the landlord) aware of what was going on.  Payment needed to be scheduled with me.  Technician needed to inform both the tenant and me as to what was going on with the A/C.  A/C Guys handled all of this with ease, and kept me informed\nat all times. So easy.  \nIn addition, the technician (Matt) gave me two options for repair (I have never had THAT happen before - nice).  In the office (Ty) coordinated it all, and e-mailed me a receipt.\nProfessional business, honest, great repair, and affordable prices.  I highly recommend this business, and will continue to use A/C Guys, Inc. in the future.
0;Food took an HOUR to get to us.  Then it was cold but we were too hungry to send it back and have them spit in it.  I really enjoyed this place when it was in Mesa but they just lost a customer.  Horrible.
2;The epicenter ale is very good.  We just had to take some home so we ordered a six pack to go.  This place is a lot like Four Peaks in Tempe except  the food is a little more expensive (beer prices are similar though).  The food isn't as good as Four Peaks so we will go there over this place from now on but I wouldn't tell people to stay away...try it, it's OK
3;I needed a quick lunch while buzzing around Phoenix. I have heard a lot of good things about Zoe's and since I was there,I thought I would give it a go!\nParking can be tight, at lunch time at least. Lots of people have the same idea.\nI got a simple lunch,but it was very good.\nLimeade was my drink of choice, quite good and they say sweetend with Cane sugar.\nI got the Zoe Club Pita. Was fresh tatsing as good.\nChicken, Ham ,and swiss cheese, with lettuce ,tomato and some spicy mustard, I asked for extra spice.\nNot a bad experiance at all. The place is clean and modern looking.
4;5 stars by far place is super busy but worth the wait! Food is great staff is friendly, and accommodating. Seating area is small but the kitchen is open to watch them cook. First  and only hawaiian bbq place I'll eat at. If you are picky like me it's a big step to try it but I wasn't disappointed!
1;Poor and inconsistent service.   \n\nRates are high with requirements other rental companies dont have not to mention it was like they were doing me a favor for me to spend 600 bucks with them. \n\n Don't even try to rent if you use a debit card need everything from references, utility statements and first born. \n\nRecommend checking other rental agencies that appreciate return customers and more than likely have better rates.
1;Yes, it's a Las Vegas Buffet - Food here is meh - basically, low quality food with emphasis of quantity. It is pretty pricy considering what you're getting - traditional Vegas up charge, but I still think it's still a bit pricy, even by Vegas Standards. \n\nMe, I just had a couple of eggs, canned fruit, and a bowl of cereal. Personally in the future, if I have to eat on the cheap and quick - I would suggest considering a coffee shop oatmeal, fruit, and coffee. Or if you want to spend the budget - consider eating a famous French place that is listed in my Vegas list.
4;"What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the \""wine cellar\"" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.\n\nMonday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. \n\nThe first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.\n\nI do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm. It was DEAD. For Phoenix, this is a truly unique dining option. Roka is a great option for dinner before going out to Old Town, or a great spot to get together with friends to celebrate."
3;Be sure u go to the right location, Bethany Home & 16th. Next to Dick's Hideaway
2;The buffet was good. It's probably one of the price-friendly ones. It honestly didn't cost me an arm and a leg. With the remodeling done there, it was a little hard to find the buffet. It's underground... kinda-sorta. The hosts don't really pay attention to the people eating and randomly changing tables. So, it gets annoying if you have a party of 6 and this party of 4, who's already on their 3rd plates, decide to move to a roomier table. Yeah, not cool.\n\nADVISORY:\nGet there early, in a blink of an eye... the lines are crazy.
1;I usually am quite the fan of Uswirl. I come here once every two weeks or so. On 6/4 at 9PM I walked in with my family to get some frozen yogurt. The service was TERRIBLE. There was nearly NO fruit toppings out and when I asked the girl at the cashier to please grab some strawberries she was on her phone and I had to call her 3 or 4 times to even get her attention. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes. A kid about 15 kept walking in and out of the store and communicating with the other male worker- very unprofessional as I believe they were speaking of drugs or some type of confrontation happening across the way involving their friends. Very dissatisfied.
1;Not bad, if you like low quality, pre-prepared school cafeteria lunch food. Make sure you ask which dish has the surprise plastic wrap hidden in it. If you find it, you're the night's winner! And the plastic is your prize!
3;Sushi is fresh and service is great.  I just wish the place could accommodate more people.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth the time.
3;Mmmm... Beer... and the grub ain't to shabby either.\n\nWho does not like roasted peanuts with the shell and pitch them on the floor after eating the nuts?
4;Deceive your diet! Indulge in any of the appetizers and entrees knowing your feeding your body with something that's not only nutritious but tastes delicious! Sure bets are the Caprese salad, Chicken Shawarma, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. Prices are under $15 and portions are generous.
3;Get the tacos! They are awesoooome!
1;I though it was overpriced, the steak was good, but not great. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Vegas that are better for half the price.
0;"This place needs to close.  Half the waitresses are tweekers with missing teeth.  Our server must have have been on meth, she messed up the entire order.  I talked to the manager, Javier, about the service, and he said \""what do you want me to do about it?\""  This Applebees has seen better days."
4;Tried a few of the manicurists here before I settled with Cecilia. Meticulous quality!
2;I've been here several times and tried the chimichanga, street tacos, and the pollo fun dido. The chimi and tacos are just ok. A little flat in flavor. The fun dido is real tasty with a good kick and a lot of cheese. Their complimentary chips n salsa are delicious and they give you a variety with flour and corn chips!  The margarita is very good but a little light In the tequila zone. I'd like to give them a 4 star if it wasn't for the rather inflated prices, but I suppose they're in the right area for it in n. Scottsdale. I will be back but will most likely get a beer instead of the cocktail.
1;Do not move here!!! my wife and i were looking for a nice place to live in vegas and i thought this would be the spot... we rented for a year so we could find the right house to buy... Thank god i am only locked in here for 6 more months... it is a section 8 community, so now i pay full price for my house but all my neighbors do not... Its not fair and i have to listen to them fight all the time about drugs and have seen 2 physical fights as well... Security does nothing but tells you to call Metro... Save your time and money and look somewhere else... The golf course has gone downhill too, they give out 3 months of unlimited golf for $69, so that brought all the right crowds here too... There are plenty more communities that are safer than this and do not have section 8... ( section 8 housing in a gated community is a oxymoron... )
4;We loved everything about Frost! The service was great and the Gelato speaks for itself, absolutely delicious! We especially loved that everything was made fresh on site and does not contain preservatives.  Friendly staff and a clean store. Definitely a place we plan to visit more often.
3;We came here on a Thursday night with a large group of 20 plus.  The place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu groups/seating.  The service was great.  The servers checked-in on us as a group and individually.  Without even asking, they kept all our bills separately which made settling the check a breeze.  Trust me, that is a huge undertaking in group settings.  Decent list of wine selections.  The pizza was delicious.  Definitely a cool chill place to be if you want to get away from the craziness everywhere else on Mill.
4;"So glad that I can update my review to now be 5 star. Foonzo went through a couple of changes as they were testing out to see what worked and what didn't, now that it works, oh damn does it work!!! They now have more beer choices, a fully stocked bar, and a full kitchen. Prices have leveled out and having a super competent and adorable waitress was also a great change! I uploaded the food / drink menus in the photos, I tend to judge restaurants on the \""different\"" dishes, such as veggie burgers. I can confirm that their veggie burger is DELICIOUS. They have the perfect marinade, and dipping in their BBQ sauce made me glad I ordered the veggie over the pattie and bacon (this coming from a carnivore). Their beer buckets are perfect for keeping your table in order and their \""drop shots\"" are an inexpensive little party round (try the Chupacabra - tequila & Monster). They also have a nerdy-named martini menu which is a nice touch. So excited to come here regularly and master my gaming skills."
1;Never again!!\nNobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere. \nIt took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch, and no imported draft).\nThe uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample, who cares to eat a bunch of slop.\nI've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year.\nI guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas.\nGo to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged.\nCaveat Emptor
0;"absolutely awful the fish and chips was on a par with Long John Silvers, $6-25 for a bottle of Harp, $30-00 total and the skank waitress after I left $40-00 to cover it asked \""do you want change\"" well duh I ain't leaving 33.333% for something that should have cost $10 max jeez avoid at all costs !"
0;"Dr. Lepore is amazing. Expertise, bedside manner, etc: amazing. The rest of the operation, however, is not.\n\nKidfixers stops being spectacular as soon as you attempt to contact them outside the office. If you call them during business hours they will not pick up. So you leave a message that they will never respond to. Sometimes they leave hilariously frustrating messages like \""Call back during business hours.\"" After you called and left a message first thing in the morning. They do this consistently day after day. \n\nIf your kid gets sick just take them in, if you can get worked in, and if you do there's an extremely good chance you'll not see Dr. Lepore, who is the whole reason you should go here. If you try and call the emergency line, even for something basic like a mild fever, they're answer is going to be \""make an appointment.\"" So just go in.\n\nAnd should a pharmacy or insurance representative call or fax the office do not worry, the staff consistently and thoroughly ignores all these requests. So should even the slightest hiccup occur with anything, Kidfixers will forget you exist.\n\nDr. Lepore is a great physician, however his clinic cannot be relied on to do anything. I would recommend this place to people who enjoy waiting days to never be contacted while their children suffer with treatable illnesses."
1;"We were a party of five looking for a light meal.  Several of us initially selected the happy hour special of soup and grilled cheese, but the tomato bacon soup apparently is very spicy, which didn't appeal to members of my party. When we looked closer at the menu, it appeared that a lot of the dishes involved a lot of peppers...and a lot of goat cheese. \n\nAnyway, I took advantage of the happy hour beer specials, but unfortunately I really hated the second beer (something by Deschutes that I think might have been skunked). Our server disappeared for the first of several times; another server ended up getting me a different drink.\n\nTwo members of my group ordered quesadillas, one chicken and one steak; when the runners brought one to the table, they said, \""here's a chicken quesadilla...or steak, I don't really know,\"" and plopped it down. My squash spaghetti arrived several minutes after everyone else's dishes. My dish was underwhelming: the goat cheese (of course!) was congealed in clumps (as one might have expected), the sauce was very oily, and the dish had no discernible seasoning. \n\nAfter we had finished, our plates lingered for far too long. Once we received the check, we actually never saw our initial server again, having to flag down another server to get our credit card processed.\n\nI'm not really sure what this place is going for. At the price point for dinner, the food and service need to be much better than it is."
4;Open until 2AM!!\n\nPhoenix for some reason is lacking on late night dining. This is why I give Delux gets five stars. The food amazing and ambiance up-to-date, open until 2AM seven day a week.
4;Yes, this is, indeed, the best market in the city.  The only way you could do better is to go to a farm stand at a farm and/or pick your own.  This is like the convention of the best and most well known and most local farmers there are in the area.  In supplement, some of the best stuff is brought in from California  So take your pick: super local direct from your farmers, or semi-local but exotic and fresh and brought to you with love and care by Kerry.
3;We love sushi and we have been to some of the best sushi places in most of the major cities in the US and Canada. We are always looking for good sushi at a good price. So after getting a discounted gift certificate from restaurant.com we decided to try Cafe Wasabi. It's located in a strip mall but is nicely appointed inside. We spent a good while looking at the countless rolls available which were all pictured across the counter. This is perfect for those people who like to see what they are about to eat. We ordered a several different rolls and nigiri to sample it all. \nWe spent about $70 for a two adults and 2 small kids. Good thing we had that gift certificate. Overall, the sushi was very good and the service was good. Again they have a great selection to choose from and I am looking forward to sampling more of the options.
2;"I want to give 2.5 stars but that's not an option so just imagine I did.  2.5 stars, here we go....\n\nWe went for a walk last night around our neighborhood and this place caught my eye because of the sign that said \""Well Wednesday\"" all well drinks $3!  Ok, in we went.  It was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  Whiskey and Coke for him and Whiskey Sour for me.  They came out quick, were decent sized but my Sour lacked a cherry which is a minor detail but I secretly really wanted one.\n\nWe decided to share the Fish and Chips cause we weren't super hungry, it was ok.  The fries were better than the fish I thought.  We got talked into dessert and chose the Bread and Butter pudding.  This is where 2 of the 2.5 stars come from.  It was AMAZING, warm with raisins some kind of heavenly sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.  One more drink was ordered and we got our bill.\n\nThey charged $2 extra for an extra plate because we shared the meal.  This makes me mad because they didn't state this beforehand.  If I didn't make it obvious we were sharing and just ate off the one plate would you have added the $2?  As my Dad would say because of that it's an OTOTO.  One time, one time only kind of place!"
0;Been waiting forever to order something and others said they have been here for almost an hour with no food yet
2;It was just ok. For 10 bucks for lunch with a drink I had hoped it would be a little better. I had hibachi beef, which seemed like some low grade cut, no sirloin here. Shrimp sauce and rice was good. Carrot slices and broccoli were both very tiny. Not horrible, but for the money there are much better work lunch options around here.
3;When I take my family to Vegas they get together and look up Vegas buffets to try. We got an all day passes for the Las Vegas Flamingo, Paris, Harris, and 4 other hotels for 49.00 a person for a 24 hour pass with Totalrewards. If you purchase the All Day Pass at dinner time you can have Breakfasts, Lunch and Dinner the next day a good deal you think but for 4 people that's $218.00 dollars with tax. My family wanted to stay an extra couple of days so we found a good rate at The Rio. hotel. Out of all the Buffets we went to the Carnival World Buffet was the best experience and it was not even close. I have stayed at the Rio before and have always loved this buffet. They have a very large section and they have sea food too. I will say that for years this Buffet would have always gotten 5 stars from me but this last time it just seemed that it as gone down just a little but I can't put my finger on what it is. Buffets have become so high in price and there are so many Buffets in Vegas now the Rio may have let there buffet slip just a little. With that being said I still think this buffet is in the top 5 of buffets in Vegas.
0;Requires you the purchase everything from drinks, and extra fees for people who aren't even smoking. Seriously? This place I do not recommend at all. Try a different hookah place.
3;Third stop on an Aria/Crystals foodie crawl.  We sat down at the bar eager for some tapas and sangria.  I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.\n\nWe went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.\n\nWe also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.\n\nFinally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.\n\nA good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.\n\nCheck out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.  They pipe in some Spanish language tapes which are pretty hilarious.  Great restaurant!
1;"Wheelhouse lounge in Casino was very slow service. \""signature\"" Fries are terrible, fresh fish sandwich good but oily, Italian sausage ok, wedding soup was tasty. Large screen sports bar is nice but drafty in the back. There is better food in the Casino, probably won't go here again.\n\nForget this place, pay a little more and go to Andrews."
3;"This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...\n\nFor lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. \n\nI ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their \""light\"" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. \n\nMy friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. \n\nAnyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then \""chopped\"" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!\n\nMy other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the \""special culinary name\"" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. \n\nI also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! \n\nSoooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple \""light\"" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? \n\nCowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20. \n\nOh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+. \n\nCan't wait to go back for dinner..."
4;Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.
1;The smells are wonderful.  Cannot wait to taste!  The employees are not to friendly at first. They seemed impatient when were we trying to decide on what to order.  Hope the food is outstanding to make up for the employees.\nWell sorry to say the pizza was old. We ordered a pepper and egg sandwhich and that was good.
1;I visited tonight for the first time and ordered three rolls: a rainbow roll, volcano roll, and screaming orgasm.\n\nThey brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.\n\nThe volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.\n\nThe screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.\n\nService was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever come back to this place.  There are MUCH better alternatives all over town.
2;Amazing food, horrible waitress, we asked for a teaspoon and she said they don't have any, then brings a teaspoon anyways???? Idiot! She should be fired.
2;Like Tortilla Fish.  Very simple menu,  fish tacos (steamed or fried), shrimp tacos (fried only), a few salads and quesadillas, that's all.  No rice or beans. But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.   \n\nI did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.\n\nDining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.\n\nGood value..
2;Ordered delivery my first night in town.\nLoved the cheese sticks with the Garlic Butter dip. \nThe pizza was A-OK. \nIn flavor, the crust reminded me of the national pizza chain with the red white and blue logo. \nMore toppings that that chain. \nI woudl pick Toppers over that other chain.
2;I hate to do this but I have to bring Aloha Nails down a star. Mainly because of the service I had today. \n\nFor the most part, most of the ladies are very nice and are meticulous in their work. Today, I wasn't so lucky. I usually only get a pedicure but decided to have both a manicure and pedicure. \n\nThe nail tech doing my pedicure was nice and was careful in her work. It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. \n\nWhen I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows. I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. \n\nShe asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.\n\nShe must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't. It's disappointing because I've had good service here before, a few times.\n\nI would go back to Aloha Nails because it's so convenient - maybe just for a pedicure - but I'd avoid this nail tech in the future.
3;"Saw a noodle house advertised and wondered where it was.  Been eating at Phoenix Palace for several months before I discovered China Magic.  First time we were the only patrons in the restaurant; my friend from Long Island is very particular about her Chinese food; she loves this place.  My other friend is very picky about food to begin with; but still he loves this place.  So, we brought another friend from the Philippines and he really loves this place.  Just mostly stick to the noodle dishes.  Wish the drive wasn't so far; but definately be back."
0;"Their lack of service really outweighed the quality of their food, so for that I am giving them one star (I wish I could give none).\n\nThe waitresses thoroughly pissed both me and my bf off. First of all, we were the first people to go into the restaurant at 11am. Once we entered, they looked over at us from the bar and I said \""hello\"" with a smile on my face, which was quickly turned into a scowl after they just stared at us without responding. We just stood their for 5 minutes while they kept on talking to each other at the bar. Then FINALLY one of them comes up to us and says \""yes, what can i help you with?\"" \""um, we're here for breakfast\"" is what we said. Then she told us to sit in the front without even bringing us over to a table. \n\nWe picked out what we wanted fairly quickly. We both got Cuban style breakfasts which were $8.95 each (pretty overpriced for what you get). My plate consisted of some plantains, two potato balls, two pieces of toast, and eggs....for $8.95. Which reminds me that they totally screwed up on my order. I ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy. They brought us our plates (after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we were the only customers) and both plates had over easy eggs. I didn't even bother complaining because I knew it was just going to take even longer and we were on pressed time. I felt like they just did all the eggs over easy to make it simpler for themselves. \n\nMy bf finished his plate first and he scooted his empty plate to the side of the table so the waitress could see and pick it up. Instead the waitress sat some lady that just arrived to a booth next to us and started talking to her in Spanish for a while, took her order, then walked right past our table without taking the plate or giving us and refills. Shortly after that, I finished my plate of food. At that point there were TWO empty plates at the side of the table and TWO empty cups next to them. It really ticked me off to see the waitress bring the lady's order out right away, talk to her some MORE, then pass our table ONCE AGAIN without doing anything. We were literally sitting there doing nothing. \n\nThe waitress went to the lady's table again to talk to her some more and that's when my boyfriend asked her for the bill, then she asked us if we wanted some refills and took our plates. If that's what it takes to get refills and a clean table at this place then that's just ridiculous.\n\nShe came out with not our bill, but the bill for the lady in the booth next to us. WTF that really got us mad! That lady next to us arrived about 30 minutes after we arrived.  We asked for the bill ONCE AGAIN and she brought it out along with the other lady's change. My bf slammed his card on the bill right away cuz we were not in the mood to wait any longer. \n\nAs we waited for the waitress to bring us the receipt I noticed all the other waitresses just standing around the bar DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR. That's probably what they do all day long since the bar has a wall made up of mirrors. It was so annoying, there was about 5 other waitresses and not one of them could give us good service. I noticed one of the waitresses made a stripper outfit out of her uniform. All of her tramp stamp tattoos were showing since she rolled her shirt up and she was wearing hoochi shorts, I found it very unprofessional. \n\nOur receipt finally came. I begged my bf not to give a tip, unfortunately he did lol, but it was only 5 percent. They really deserved less considering they neglected the hell out of us . \n\nI don't know if it was because of the way we looked (my bf has dreads and I have a nose piercing) but the service was just horrible and it seemed like it was only like that for us. Either way, no establishment should be run like this. \n\nWe still want to try the Cuban buffet and we plan on doing so next week. Luckily with buffets you go and get your own food, so we won't be needing much of their services. I guess then I'll be able to post something about their food. That is, if they don't make a black cloud hover over it with their service."
0;Very bad experience at BLD this morning.  On our last vist the waitress forgot to place our order, after 30 minutes we left.  Today the service very poor and slow.  The wait staff just doesn't care about customer service.  Stopped woman manager and told her we had been waiting 35 minutes for our food.  No apologies, she brought our food and never stopped by our table thru the meal to see if everything was okay.  Too loud and too much of a bar atmophere for breakfast.  Never again and I live just down the street.
2;We had the wristbands to go to several buffets, but staying in the Palazzo we got a little lazy the second day and went here instead of walking further down. The food here is pretty much the same as other buffets but the service was super slow.\n\nMy husband I ate breakfast here twice and both times the refills never came. We watched our waitress talking to another table about fashion. I stopped a different waitress and she said I had to wait for our waitress. okay. \n\nFinally, she came back for refills about the time we were leaving. I don't think I'd go back here just based on the slow refills, call me picky, but those buffets are not cheap. If you don't opt in for the wrist band, which pays for itself in basically two meals, then show your Harrah's card and get a discount. \n\nThey were cool enough the morning our wristbands were expired to give us lunch at breakfast pricing because it was about five minutes after they stopped serving it.
3;Hog roast goodness. \nNice stuffing.\nNice apple sauce.\nReasonably priced.\nTotal win!
3;Great to see they have a brick and mortar location now since I last saw them under their different name (Frost Bites) and set up (a food truck at Boulder Highway)! \n\nHad green tea the first go around and settled on black sesame the second time. Both flavors were great! For ice that looks intricate and textured, it's incredibly soft to taste. It's not overtly sweet or syrupy. When I ordered black sesame, I had it with boba and gummies! The boba was good but the gummies were not soft and chewy. Even though I didn't enjoy them, they did make for an interesting photo. \n\nParking is limited so if you find it appreciate it.
3;How could I have missed reviewing Goyemon?!?!\n\nThis place really is a secret hot spot. Definitely popular among the locals. It get packed, so arrive early and preferably during non rush hours. The wait can be killer. \n\nGoyemon has fresh sushi and great ingredients. Before eating at Goyemon, I was not a fan of Uni (sea urchin) because of the texture and flavor. Little did I know what great uni tasted like. I'm a believer. As far as their sushi goes, I'm a fan. \n\nI would recommend trying their all you can eat.Know what you want, don't be afraid to try their specials of the day. It's hard to go wrong at Goyemon. I haven't had a dish that I was not fond of. Pick what you like, highly likely you'll enjoy it.\n\nBe forewarned, their service can be a little on the slow side, but you can compensate for that by ordering a lot when they take your first order, that way you won't be like that Brian B. guy who left a stupid ass comment on this great sushi house. If I took 22 people to Sushi Sasabune, I would get horrible service too. Moron. Next time go to Todai or something.
3;Tis good.  Very unique food.  I love the bread, it's unique.  You definitely will be full when you leave.  They also have ginger soda which is amazing.
4;"My little perforated, syrup-filled heart is full every time I come here!\n\nIt has great food and it's not too expensive. Mondays they have \""Magic Monday,\"" where you can get the breakfast magic waffle (bacon, cheese, egg on top) for $4 (maybe $5? I forget). \n\nThis place also might have my favorite breakfast potatoes in the whole city. Yeah, I said it. They are just like I want them to be: crispy on the outside and pillow-y soft on the inside, just like a french fry. This gal's no fan of soggy home fries. \n\nAnother fave is the P-wedge: a pita grilled like a waffle, slathered in cream cheese and topped with arugula, grilled tomatoes and capicola (I think you can choose other meats though, but why would you want to?!).\n\nJust go, it's delicious. Give them your money."
3;Trader Joe's is really a good place to shop - they have great produce, meat/poultry/fish, cheese, dairy, flowers, dry goods and their prepared products are usually very good and interesting/flavorful.  Wine/beer/liquor/cider selection is also very good.\n\nTheir retailing approach also generally keeps prices reasonable, although some things can be a bit pricey (but the quality is commesurate).\n\nService is very friendly as well, and they always have a treat for my child when finding Koko the monkey.  Return policy is very good as well if you get something that isn't quite right.\n\nI particularly like this location, as having Trader Joe's here (and this is similar in other locations) means more walk in traffic to the other businesses in what generally are strip malls that are older and need some redevelopment.
0;At first I though the place was ok, not especially tasty or anything, but good enough if in need of some calories. But after further reflection, and after burping fried chicken burps for about 4 hours after eating, I've decided that big in japan isn't worth the trip at all. The food court seating is somewhat lame as well.
3;This place is a diamond in the rough. The neighborhood, not so good. The building, run down and dodgy. The Food, fantastic and delicious. The service, absolutely welcoming (this may be in part to the owners knowing my GF and her family).\n\nWe ended up getting 3 dishes and I wish I could tell you what they were. However, I didn't order and everyone was speaking Cantonese so... We ended up getting a short-rib dish, a fried noodle dish and a beef and rice noodle dish.\n\nThe short ribs were alright, they had a tasty, albeit very strong 5 spice seasoning to them and were a bit on the chewy side but the flavor was good.\n\nThe Fried Noodle dish was very tasty. The noodles were fried separately from the rest of the dish so they retained a crunchiness while eating them, the bok choy and gravy were very complementary of the various meats in the dish.\n\nThe spicy beef and rice noodle dish was ordered with some random greens added. I think they just threw in whatever was fresh. Either way, my brother and GF said they like that the best. The gravy was good and the beef was tasty. My favourite part was the choy sum, crunchy and delicious.\n\nThe place was pretty full when we walked in and got pretty loud with the other two large groups. Once one of the groups left the noise level decreased exponentially and the owner came out and started chatting it up with everyone still dining.\n\nAs stated in other reviews, there are many non-menu items/specials posted to the walls but they are all in Chinese so I will just leave that stuff to question (though they might be fun to try one day).
4;We had dinner in this restaurant . Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!
3;What a great shop! They did repairs on my 95 Honda Accord and tinted a widow! Great customer service and will be back! I was referred by a coworker to AZM and let me tell you what a great feeling it is to find a great local shop!   Yep Im a fan!
3;The place is great. Very quick service.Wiil defentlycome back
1;"I'm new to the area, and on my way home from the coffee shop, I decided to stop on in. After all, I needed a new collar for my pup. \n\nI was greeted right away. Aggressively greeted, but greeted none the less. The gentleman who helped, was clearly the store manager and me spared no enthusiasm, and even up sold me to buying a new tag for the dog, too. I didn't need it, but no harm in a new shiny tag for my babe. \n\nThere was a quiet but seemingly sweet young lady behind the counter performing some kind of pet store task, and being interrupted every 35 seconds... By the gentleman who sold me on my choices and was supposed to be ringing me up. He stopped my transaction more than three times to ask her to say hello to customers who were already AGGRESSIVELY greeted by him! It took so long to just pay for the collar and tag, due to the over greeting and micro managing. I was so exhausted when I left, I said to my friend \""Remind me never to go there again\""\n\nGreat concept. But the guy running the place is just too much. I won't go back to see how grooming services are. Not if I have to deal with that guy, anyway."
4;I love coming here! My sandwich is always perfect, the soup is flavorful and I love getting free chocolate covered strawberries and bread. The line moves very quick and they are well staffed. Definitely a must try!
0;This place is tiny. We were so excited to sing karaoke. Then we found out it would be 1 1/2 hours, before it would be our turn! And there weren't many people there. What a dissapointment.
0;"I recall when the first location opened on Craig rd., it was great and this became home for dinner, lunch and sometimes in the morning after a graveyard shift. Now the staff on Craig Rd acts like they do not want to be there and can be rude at times. It's not just me but I hear this around the area from others. I have since moved near the Centennial location and had the same experience. During my first visits I loved the place, staff and people were great. Now that management has changed a couple of times the place has gone downhill. I can really tell the difference since Bobbi was the manager here and now. Staff is slow and appears to be there just to collect a pay check; no one has a welcoming attitude. Yes they greet you when come in but it feels like they are greeting because that is the rule. My first sign of the decline was when I waited 40 minutes for an order of wings from the bar. I showed a manager the time stamp on my order receipt and all I got was a, \""oh okay,  I'm sorry\"" and he walked away. As of this past Thursday (July 9, 20130) I have decided to stop coming here. I ordered six wings, spinach dip, two beers and two scotches. I noticed on the other side of the bar a customer complaining to the manager and the bar tender making a drink near me with an attitude saying, \""whatever\"" and other employees coming in the bar area trying to see what was going on. That was really nothing compared to a couple of hours after I got home. My stomach was cramping all night and the next morning and I was running to take a crap every hour or two through the night. That was the last straw; a place I once loved has gone completely downhill. Now I understand why PT's down the street has all of the business."
2;I've been twice and I like it but I haven't been amped enough to give it 4 stars quite yet. It takes some instruction the first time you go...you order off a tablet. It's not cosmic but can be a little cumbersome and time consuming. However, if you are the type to order a specific item then change everything on it and put half of it on-the-side then you will love it. Most annoying to my wife is that when you order a drink, you don't get that drink until your food comes (we always go harass them before that though). \n\nThe food is good and ingredients are fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was a good price at $5. Then I got the Mediterranean Turkey and it was $9, plus $1 since I wanted cheese :(     Not heinous but a slightly expensive sandwich.\n\nNice worker bees. They don't really do a whole lot besides deliver your food so I'm not a huge tipper here. Too bad for them.
3;"Hmm, I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;P\nOther than the good atmosphere and good seating area, this place is great for watching the games.\nI've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend, and I must say, it's the best I've tried by far..."
3;We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues.
4;My husband and I frequently come here while we lived in the area. We love this place! The quality of the food and the service is awesome!  I don't mind the price, I rather spend the money on fresh REAL food than throwing my money away to a sub par establishment. The staff is so awesome! We will miss this place! Keep up the good work everyone!
0;"Weak donuts!  My 13 yr old son only took a few bites of his apple fritter before saying \""this is gross\"" & discarding it.  I got the donut holes & they were average at best.  Wouldn't go back, even for a free dozen."
4;Ihave been bringing my cat Squishee here for a year or two now and I have to say, I am always impressed with Dr. Grossman's knowledge and his mild, calm demeanor when handling my Squishee kitty! Squishee is 16 years old and the staff always make a big to do about his arrival and treat him so good! \n\nI am getting ready to take my other ca, much younger, named Basil to him for his first annual with Dr. Grossman. I definitely trust this clinic's opinions and values when it comes to my pet's well being. 5 STARS!!!
4;Damn do I love me some Smiling Moose. I have been coming here since it was way more divey and still had holes in the walls (way back before those walls were red, and way back before food was served.) I like everything about this place. I like the upstairs venue for shows. I like the big screen in the back and the random whatever that's on it. I like the drinks named after movies, particularly the Captain Spaulding, and I actually do enjoy the apathy of the staff. I like to drink and be left alone with other heavily tattooed people that like to drink and be left alone. Occasionally, we feel like being social creatures, and when we do, we come to the moose. I have always felt welcome here, and my non-tattooey friends have never felt unwelcome, and that's the most important part. This place gets a rep for only serving a certain kind of people and nothing could be further from the truth. Every bar has it's niche, and some don't seem too welcoming to those who don't fit the profile, that's not the case here. The bartenders aren't going to kiss your @$$, and that's just fine because that's not what I'm looking for. They are going to make you some killer (moderate pun intended) drinks and they are going to laugh at your drunk stupid self. I love this place.\n\nOh yeah...the food is actually pretty awesome.
4;"The carrot raisin muffins alone are deserving of the 5 stars.  This trip the hubby had the chicken pot pie and I had the Quiche Lorraine.  Pot pie was flaky and comforting.  Quiche was fluffy and not dense, just the way I like it.  The food is always good here.  I also had an iced coffee and it was perfect.  Service is 10x better here than the Mimi's Cafe on Sahara.  I took my cousin to the Mimi's on Sahara about a month ago and the waiter acted like he had never heard of an \""iced coffee\"".  My cousin had to literally tell him to give her a coffee with ice."
0;Spoke to a nice lady on the phone. Drove halfway across town to purchase a bike. When I got there, the lady wasnt there, instead it was her husband.  She was going to give me 10% off, but the husband would only honor that if I was military or ex-military...a complete waste of my time!  Owner was rude! I would recommend staying away from this place...I just noticed that bikeshops.mtbr.com has similar reviews of this place going back to 2008...those reviews are dead on!
2;Being a lazy bum who doesn't want to wash his own truck, and having sworn off Danny's and their army of overly aggressive windshield replacement sales goobs, I took the advice of some Tweeters and rolled into Los Olivos. \n\nThe $15 wash was more than adequate but the real experience value came from what Los Olivos didn't do: They didn't try to upsell me and nobody messed with my seats. Seriously, don't touch the seats. \n\nI would recommend Los Olivos because my vehicle was clean, the people were nice, and they aren't associated with Danny's Carousel in any way. And that's enough.
1;"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return."
2;Don't get me wrong this place is very fancy. I like that they play new and old movies.\n\nYou go to the cashier and you pay for a your ticket and you also get a huge menu for food and drinks. As you continue to walk into the movie theater you will see a huge bar. No one was sitting there, but if you wanted to get wasted before a movie this is your place to go. \n\nYou'll see waiters and waitress walking all around and you find your theater. You walk in and there are rows with huge comfy chairs with a side table that you can put in front of you if you get food or drinks. Don't get me wrong  you definitely get a lot of leg room! However there is one row that is just a row of computer chairs up to a bar table. No one was sitting in front of me, but I can imagine if it was a tall guy/girl I wouldn't have been able to see the screen too well.\n\nWith the Groupon that I got it came with a free drink so I got a strawberry lemonade, It'd order it again. Beside the Groupon we ordered a popcorn which was also good. I know they had a lot of other stuff like chicken and pizza and stuff, but I wasn't there to eat dinner. \n\nYou have servers walking all around through the movie and you just push this little red button if you want something. But you do have to hear talking through the movie if someone decides to order then. \n\nI also must say it was very cold in there! So if you want to get away from the Arizona heat, this is the place for you.
0;This was the first time that we have eaten at Babbo and we opted for take-out. No complaints about the staff they were all nice...but oh my goodness...the food...one word sums it up...blech. We both ordered the chicken marinara sandwiches which we later found out were no longer on the menu at this location...and we decided to split an order of spaghetti and marinara. I asked for some extra marinara sauce for my sandwich...I asked for it on the side as in a small container...it was on my sandwich and it made it too messy to pick up. My first bite nearly made me fall off my chair...the focaccia bread was so salty that the roof of my mouth was burning...and each subsequent bite was the same...I tried scraping it off the bottom but it was too far baked into the bread to do that. Now everyone who knows me knows that I salt salt...that is not a typo...salt is a food group for me...they really over did this spice. The chicken was tough and tasteless. The spaghetti with marinara sauce actually needed some salt...or some taste...it too was awful. We do take-out four or five nights a week and the food is always fine..we never have any complaints no matter what we order...I am watching my husband tidy up and there is a ton of food left...he asked what I wanted him to do with it and I said throw it all out...he normally eats the leftovers but he doesn't want any of it. I have a stomach ache from all of the salt and my mouth still feels weird from it. Why so much salt on bread? I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I think if people want salt it should be their choice to add it...this was our first and our last visit to Babbo. My husband is more tolerant than I am about bad food...I told him he could probably save all of the chicken that I didn't eat and put it on a sub roll for lunch tomorrow...he said no thanks...and he just remarked that it was about as disappointing a meal as you can get. Wish I could give it a bunch of minus stars. Blech. blech...blech!
2;Good value, pretty good food.  I give Sultan's props for serving middle eastern in a culinarily lacking location.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The food was relatively good - especially considering the price - $6.99 for lunch special which ends up at $7.50 with tax.  The restaurant smelled a little bit like public restroom (the cleaner) which was kind of a turn off.
3;Nice Indian place hidden atop hill on Greentree. Food was good as expected of a good Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Sangrilla, Lamb Korma, and Kheema Naan ...all were great.
4;I got to open a bottle of Champagne with a sword!
3;I go out of my way to find a Fry's. Great customer service, excellent quality in food, great prices, clean stores & fuel points. I buy my gift cards for work and what ever I want to spend money on then turn around and get the discount at the pump. Good call! you'll always find me shopping at Fry's
1;We have been eating around a little now that we are retired and have time to experience new places for lunch. We arrived just before noon and there was some activity and all the TVs pumping all sorts of yesterdays games or today's sport news.Being the grump I am I asked if one of the 30 or so TVs could be turned to CNBC business news as I like keeping up on my other game.It never happened. \nI asked what of three sandwiches would be best today, Philly, Reuben, or french dip. It was suggested that the Reuben. Only half good. The meat was bland as it was held in a water bath to keep warm and its texture was weak. The bread was so so and french fries average. I won't be back. Service was average but had like 4 different peeps at the table.which I don't\n care for. I like dealing with one server.
1;Just a bad night. Maybe but, bad service and food is unforgivable when paying big dollars. Nothing more to say.
4;Came here to just try it out, but then their food just blew me away! The service is way better then Roberto's the workers actually serve with a smile! The drive through is really convenient. Awesome experience overall and I would defiantly come back again!
0;Waiter served me a cold meal left over from a party being held there.  Absolutely horrible experience.
1;Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...\n\nBut expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.
3;Stayed at the Palazzo for a crazy Halloween weekend in Vegas. \n\nWith almost no deals that weekend, being that the Cigar Convention AND that is was Halloween, we were going to pay a pretty penny anywhere we went. At least at the Venetian and Palazzo, you get a little suite with your room. \n\nI've stayed at the Venetian, and the Palazzo definitely feels like a mini upgrade. The building is newer, the rooms are modern-chic, and the room had a total of three tvs. One in the bathroom! \n\nI got to shower, while watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show, on Halloween. You can't beat that!!\n\nRoom service was fast and pretty affordable. The beds were very comfy, and the couch could have held 2 extra party crashers on it. The parking was confusing at first, but after one time, it's easy.
1;"We had a great team event (getting to know other team members) here but not much can be said abt the food. I had the ahi tuna with cold soba noodles, the soba wasn't bad but the tuna had some funky taste to it. The sauce did not go well and it was just undesirable. I left half of it behind. First time that I did not fish ahi tuna! We had a big group for dinner, abt 20 but the entire restaurant was empty but it took ages before we received the food. They were certainly not understaffed since there were at least 20 servers running around but no idea why. \n\nI'm sorry but two star is being generous; 1 for the great group camaderie and networking event we had and 2 for the somewhat nice interior decor."
0;"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
3;Better thank Subway by a mile. However it's just a sandwich. A good sandwich though. If you are in the mood for a cold cut sandwich you can't go wrong here. The bread is fresh and the quality of the meets and cheeses are better than most other sandwich shops. When I'm in the mood for a sandwich POS is usually my 1st choice.
1;"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCame on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\n\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\n\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\n\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\n\n\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\n\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \""get it whenever we're ready\"", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \n\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \n\n\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \n\n\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \n\n\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks."
2;Food was very average...Entree selection was not impressive, deserts were very good.   Ambience was low key-boring....... \n\nNot bad for the price, but not memorable...
1;I love total wine...just not this one.\n\nI shop for beer and occasionally shop for wine. I'm not sure if the stocking is broken up into sections by type of alcohol (spirits, wine, beer) but whoever orders the beer does a horrible job. I can always count on this Total Wine to NEVER have what I'm looking for. The shelves are almost always half full with gaps everywhere and signs saying it's out of stock. If I want a good selection, I drive to the one of Shea.\n\nFIRE the person who orders the beer! North Scottsdale can get it right, you should be able to as well.
3;This is really cool place and the service is AMAZING! We had a great time and the ambiance was just perfect. A mixture of contemporary flair with interesting decor. I do want to share some details about my experience. Visited for dinner. 10/3/2012\n\nService: Simply amazing. The waitresses were all smiles and very accommodating. I had several requests for my dish and they got them perfect. Both waitresses were always checking in on us and I thought it was great how they supported each other.  Nothing fell through the cracks!\n\nAmbiance. Casual and hip, yet romantic. Lots of energy in the place and you could see others were enjoying their conversations sitting around their rustic wooden tables and eating great food. \n\nFood (appetizers). The mussels oreganata are out of this world. I truly believe you would be hard pressed to find a more flavorful dish anywhere in town. The textures and flavors in this dish are very unique...you will love them. The sweet chili and bacon prawns were great but a little too sweet and spicy for my taste.\n\nFood (entrees). I was really excited for my beef wellington but unfortunately it was average. The pastry around it was thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of an instant gravy packet :(  The scampi stuffed chicken pasta was very good and the balsamic vodka sauce was incredibly flavorful.\n\nPrice. For a casual dinner for two, $150 was a tad expensive for my taste. Do not get me wrong, the food is great but I do not think charging around the same amount as some of the high end restaurants on the strip entices customers to visit as often as they like. It their prices were a bit less expensive, I would definitely visit quite often. \n\nOverall experience. Great restaurant and I would recommend it to friends and family. Having said that, I would try other stuff on the entree menu and would most certainly NOT recommend the Wellington.
0;Decent food.  Comparable to Panera Bread.  Terrible service. Extremely expensive ($40 for three sandwiches and three drinks).  Unkind staff.  Impolite.
2;I love supporting small local businesses, especially if it's Hawaii based/influenced. \nI met a few friends here for lunch and everything was good. The location, service and food was all good but nothing special. I ordered combo plate with pork and 2 pc shrimp katsu that included miso soup, 2 pc daikon and rice (rice was mushy) and I paid for a small side of curry and it all came out to $20.(If I didn't order the curry it would have been around $18).\nPlease don't get me wrong....the food here was good just not worth the price. You can get chicken katsu that also includes miso soup, cucumber sunomono and salad for $8.50 at Soho down the street!! \n\nI say come here and eat to support locals from hawaii. But if you don't want to overpay then just go to \n1. Soho down the street and order Chicken Katsu (lunch menu only).\n2. Curry Zen (spring mtn)\n3. L&L Hawaiian BBQ :)
4;Beautiful place. the inside was stunning! Didn't eat here just had some drinks, the tequila selection is nice and the staff is great. Definitely will come back to eat!
3;Another gem off the beaten path. It's in the Wal - Mart plaza. \n\nThe BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.\n\nEverything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. \n\nThis is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. \n\nThe Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes. \n\nWorth checking it out.
3;Also known as the Penalty Box. Best place to go if you want to be full and hammered for approximately $10. It's more than a dive bar! Food and drink specials every night. My favorite specials are the hamburger, tacos at $0.25 a piece, and pirogues at 15 cents a piece. Aside from the food they have a variety of cheap and craft beer, well below even the Pittsburgh drink average. Bartenders are super nice and let you have the remote to the tv. I used to watch a lot of law and order SVU here. \nEvery once in a while someone will be drunk and accidentally take your drink or offer you some coke.. Other than that his place has gotten me through so many rough times and I am grateful for its existence! I hope it never closes or changes. A true gem!
0;So these guys were meant to finish putting my tires on in 45 minutes, yeah? Thus my hiatus to Culver's, yeah? Hoping that on my return in 45 minutes, my car would have two brand new 255/95R18's on as they quoted, yeah? It didn't quite happen that way! \n     I strolled back from Culver's ready to drive off....but the numbers on my invoice were not the ones I paid for... they put on some tires that cost 90 bucks each, when I paid for 280 each for two!  Not sure why they did this....were they hoping that I would drive off not realizing since I'm female? ? ?
3;I'm pretty easy when it comes to buffets.  I only have a few requirements:  (1) a clean dining room, (2) fresh and tasty crab legs and fried chicken and (3) mind-blowingly good sweet treats.  Carnival World Buffet satisfies all three with added extras like a great dim sum and fried food section.  Loved the fried food: fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried scallops and onion rings!! Crab legs were juicy and tasty and the fried chicken wings were great.\n\nAnd I couldn't help but come back to get more sweet treats like their mint chocolate chip gelato with warm chocolate bread pudding and their bananas foster.  \n\nHighly recommended.
2;Munchies is okay, but it doesn't hold a candle to Yogurtland, IMHO.  On my last visit I couldn't find a flavor that I liked.  Vanilla tasted the best of all of them, and that never happens!  A lot of the flavors taste very artificial.  The friends I go there with, though, always pick up a couple of pre-packed quarts to take home, so I guess I'm in the minority.  I'm not a toppings person, except for an occasional little squirt of fudge, so I can't judge or compare those.\n\nBut Menchies is much closer to my house, and I love that they support the community, so I will continue to patronize them.
4;We enjoy coming here for all of our ASU, Yankees, and Raiders needs. Owners are great people and Raiders fans!
0;"RIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: \""Magazines 29 cents\"", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that's their system. Won't be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy."
0;"Went on a late Tuesday afternoon. I can't imagine what this place looks like on a weekend.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to make one side for small dogs, and the other for larger dogs? If there was a scuffle, it wouldn't be a possible death sentence? Or if the larger dogs do run a little bit, my dog wouldn't get trampled and possibly break its leg? That is my one major complaint.  If you are on the passive side, why would you bring a ball and thrower, and have a 150 pound dog. That worries me a little and doesn't really suggest a passive dog. One bad jump, or one bite, and my dog is dead or seriously injured. \n\nAlso, why are the people so.... rude and unwelcoming? I felt like I was in grade school getting picked last for kickball. No, i am not from Scottsdale. I didn't bring Poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it's leash. I'm the new girl...oooooh.\nI literally had one lady come up to me, stare, then say \""Are those dogs with you?\"" I say yes, she stares some more and then walks away. ???\nI just stood there feeling like an a-hole.\nIf I seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs I would at least come up and BE FRIENDLY.\n\nYes it's large and somewhat clean, especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there (some 4 to 1 person).  If you like crowds, then this is for you. I'm just not into being treated like a leper. Being around 25 dogs, and 12 snotty people that don't pay attention and use it as their social hour. The only thing this place is missing is a martini bar."
1;Went in this Wed night to get away from the housemates. Was not in the most upbeat manner. Found the place boring. Football on all screens jukebox cut off. Bunch of old guys mostly. The rest were mostly fat couples getting wasted and guys with to much sideburns.\nThen a couple of brothers (black men) also old walked in wearing their throw back Shaft leather jackets. Totally weird crowd!\n\nThe bartender was a slim young woman that needs to go to bartending school. I watched her attempt to make cocktails with more than 2 ingredients. What a disaster! She over pours and under pours and added some ingredients like whiskey to what was suppose to be a long island!   Pours the largest straigt shoots I have ever seen and I tell you I have been to bars like in MT, WY, AK and New Orleans and not seen anything close to this size of a shoot!\n\nConsulted with some off duty guy on how to make 6 Kamikazes (ended up being 5 and she had to make another that end up being 2.5 drinks instead of 1) and together with a book they came up with a cranberry version because, get this they have no lime juice! What sorta bar in the SW opens its doors without LIMES or LIME JUICE?  The guy kept calling the drink Cosmos and I kept repeating I know the difference and the order was KAMIKAZES.  Then he brings me the book and is still pointing out Cosmos!  I verbally give the bartender the recipe for Kamikazes plus the variation for a blue one. Guy says you must make a lot of drinks! I say you want to hire me - I've got experience?\n\nI tell you if they want to keep the doors open they better get some help with bar and budget knowledge. The budget is being shoot by over pours and wrong pours and if the liquor control sees this they're certian to be busted/fined. Hey but the bartender knows how to wash glasses well so that was a relief to see.\n\nAnd it's true that drinks are about $4 though the sign says $5! LOL\nWhat an experience. I left confident in my bartending skills though I haven't poured in a month!
0;The hostesses didn't say a word to me until I had been staring at them and tapping my foot for seven minutes while they talked with each other. Later on getting the check and then processing it each took ages. It wasn't even a full section. The food was okay...
3;"I was really worried about going on any vacation without the dogs and didn't think it was possible!\n\n I didn't want to burden family and friends. Also, I'm \""that person\""- that stresses what my dogs eat  and most of our friends \""free feed\"" commercial crap or have stuff out that may be an issue with our dogs (like kids leaving cheetos out, kids toys, pens, stuffed toys, etc) and they not realize it until it's torn to bits.\n\nOn the other hand, I am really apprehensive about leaving them to some strangers. Everyone has that nightmare thought of what if a place will neglect them and just care about the money?  \n\nAfter so much hub bub of researching and asking around, I decided to pop in with my dogs to see how they would react to the people and the place. They seemed fine so we booked out trip. \n\nThey give you a webcam address that you can access on your computer or there is a phone app to access their feed. Mind you the cameras are still and do not show the whole room so sometimes your dog may be on the fringes like mine were. Unfortunately those two were mostly on the fringes so I had to check often to even see where they are and would get a few moments of seeing them run onto screen and run back out of range. Still nice to see them and general monitor the facility. I saw people come in and sit on the couches and pet all the dogs so it was nice to see they were friendly to the dogs and the dogs were happy to see them whenever they were there. \n\nThey seem okay when we got them, but passed out as soon as we got home. Figured, even though they slept and all there it wasn't the relaxed sleep they get being next to me. \n\nI had a groupon to use with a bath and brush grooming so I asked if I can have their nails trimmed too while they get groomed. Theirs was very long and I get nervous about trying to cut my girl down short with her black nails. They didn't take much off, just the tips so it didn't feel like it was worth $8 each when at the vets they cut it down to be short.  \n\nI got their food bags back and only half their food has been used. Remember how I said I was really freakish about their food diet? Well, I measured out portions for all the days plus one extra days worth incase. They put it in a bag so I didn't see until I got home or I might have asked about it. I don't know if they weren't eating because they're nervous or that 1 cup meals was misunderstood between both and not each since I just made a big bag with both their names on it and measurement directions. \n\nWhen we picked them up, all the feedback we got from the lady was they \""did great and were fine\"". If they weren't eating then I don't think so and I should have been told as it can be useful to know in case I board them again. More details than that would have been nice since I've never boarded them there, never left them with anyone EVER. \n\nI think overall this place is decent though. I like that the camera feed is given and the access is 24/7 (some shut it after the place closes for the night). The price is just right and great value for multiples. Many places only charge PER DOG and here there are multiple dog prices. I boarded two for $45 (average in other places is $30-$40 per dog). My dogs seem to not be unhappy being there and approached staff on camera so they had to be treated well. One of my dogs is skittish and if she was not treated well by someone, she will usually space herself from that person. \n\nI will be using them again for boarding as I at least feel comfortable knowing that my dogs are okay with this place and the staff."
2;I'm generally not a fan of waiting in line at clubs (ok, really, I'm not a fan of waiting anywhere. My natural enemy is the line.) but our group was playing things by ear that night and it landed us at Jet. We waited for about 45 minutes or so to get in but I have to say that the line was very well organized and the bouncers were very nice and tried to keep everyone in a good mood. If you are in a group of girls, of course, you can get in much faster. But being that we are nice girls we decided not to ditch our husbands (we are, after all, legally obligated to them once the trip is over) and to wait it out with them. \n\nI had always avoided going to Jet and I could never figure out why. Now having gone there I know. Its just a club. It could be anywhere. There is nothing particularly special about it in any way. I would not get bottle service here, I don't think its necessary at all. There was never a long line for the bar, and it never got to the point where it was so crowded you couldn't move. For the money that you would spend on bottle service here I would suggest you go to Tao or Tryst instead. \n\nThe music in the main room was ok, they did keep switching between pop and classic rock which tends to annoy me as I find it hard to dance to songs like Sweet Home Alabama. I enjoyed the back room where they were playing old school hip hop much, much, more and if I should ever return to Jet I would stay in that room and that room only. However, I'm not sure that I would return as I think Jet is nothing special.
1;"Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!\nI wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!\n\nA sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.\n\nWe finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.\n\nThe server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.\n\nOverall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."
4;My son has been going here for about 5 months. It's his first time in child care. He loves it here. The teachers are remarkable. He is learning sooo much! The school is extremely clean. The teachers are very organized and there are no behavior problems or issues with the children. Even when my son goes to kindergarten next year, I will definately make sure he gets to spend time with Ms. Chrystal and the rest of her staff.
4;One of the best if not the best ever Bone In Rib Eye Ive ever had. There wasnt a bad bite of that steak. It was cooked to perfection. Great stop on the book tour to a some what hidden away gem upstairs in Planet Hollywood.
4;Rooms were nice and spacious, very clean, across the street is a 24 hour walgreens so if you need anything you can get it at anytime. A lot of beggers in this area around the streets and on the bridges though.
2;At least the prices are good because the parking sucks & employees aren't very helpful.
0;"My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a birthday present.\nWe both went today and both left feeling like we were better off before we went in.\n\nMy sister made the appointment a month ago and it was for a facial, massage and pedicure.  We were expecting a call to confirm the appointment yesterday but no one had called, hmmm, not very professional...\nWe went in and the majority of the \""spa\"" is a hair salon, I'm not too fond of hair salons calling themselves a \""spa\"" just because they have a couple of massage and facial rooms, but whatever, we'll see how the staff is...\n\nWe both got massages first and I got the blind lady, Evon.  I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.\n\nSo there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.\n\nJulie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.\n\nI like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  \nGotta cater to the customers so they will come back."
2;"Just stopped in for second time this week. Ordering process went quicker. No snafus at checkout. Only had to wait a few minutes for fresh okra which they fry on order.  People before and after me had some errors in orders or  missing sides.  I did hear a lot of \""I'm sorry about that\""  but altogether seemed to go better. \n\nOrdered the 3-meat plate this time with Mac and cheese and okra.  The okra rocked! . The meat plate not so much.  Hard to decipher which was the brisket and which was pork. In my pic the upper left is the pile of fat I had to pick out before even tasting.   I may give them one more shot and that's it."
1;"Don't get me wrong... I LOVE Senor Frogs. In Mexico, but not here.. The fun was great, the dancing and the view off the patio was great. Service was okay, but took a while to get our check. The prices were outrageous, and the free \""shots\"" were only mixers with no alcohol. The Yard is priced at $24 BUT it's almost the same size as the $10 drink which the only difference is you get to keep the cup. Would I go there again? Probably not, the only thing I would do is go there to watch the Sirens show when its going on from the patio. I was sadly disappointed as it was my 30th birthday. And I have to say that both the Senor's I been to in Mexico (Mazatlan) and Ensenada and this was nothing close to either one of those...  I did not have any food, so I can't review that. Save yourself the cash and go somewhere else... And I have to add the drinks were just okay. My friend got one drink that tasted like it had too much syrup in it."
2;A group of us stayed at the Palazzo for a trade show and saw these awesome pictures of burgers from this place.  After being at a trade show for 3 days, I was hankering for some white rice.  They have Loco Moco!! YAY!  The Poutine fries, Garbage fries, and fried Mac and Cheese were gooood.  The fried mac and cheese are these bits of fried squares of creamy goodness.  Also had the fried pickles.  Wasn't to excited about these.  They sliced the pickles lengthwise and the batter was greasy and not much flavor.  My co-workers like their burgers.  There were 6 of us so I don't remember what they ordered.  I got the Loco Moco and was disappointed.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger was cooked on too high of heat too fast cause the edges were hard and dry and only a tiny piece was medium rare.  The rice... there bunch of crunchy pieces... yah.... hard rice... not good....  My coworker had the red velvet cheese cake.  There was the crust,  then there is a layer of red velvet cake and then cheese cake on top.  He really liked it.  I got the banana fosters cheese cake.  Is it worth the calories?  Only if there wasn't an ice cream place around. \n\n1 star for the fried mac and cheese\n1 star for the server who was quick and efficient (he knew we had to catch a flight)\n1 star for the Poutine and Garbage fries
3;"We ate here with some of my boyfriend's hometown friends. The food  was pretty decent, all fresh-tasting Italian. The vodka pasta the other couple mostly split was well-seasoned and wonderful, but not really worth the price tag. The steak with warmed tomatoes, one of the veal dishes, and a broccolini/sweet sausage pasta dish rounded out the meal...all very good dishes, but nothing outstanding or really that memorable. I love Italian food and pasta, but Rao's was a tad overpriced. The portions were large, but the 4 of us opted to share everything \""family-style,\"" to taste more dishes...which I also HIGHLY reccomend. I think if we had all picked one dish, we either would have been bored, disappointed, or spent too much and had too much left over to order courses. \n\nThe waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food, restaurant, chef, wine, etc....but he was sort of obnoxious and in our faces and too much....It was also a little strange to me how much information he went on about...at a nicer place like that, to just assume all of the diners were idiots with an utter lack of food knowledge was a little strange. The waiter often explained dishes and items to us, like describing the different levels of doneness for steak, explaining that broccolini is bitter, etc...I think maybe a different table of people might have loved his comments better, but oh well. All in all this place was just ok, not somewhere I'd bring friends in town to, but I would absolutely eat here meeting people."
0;Dreadful!  Went there Saturday night with a Travelzoo coupon that apparently identified us as unwelcome guests.  They sat us at the worst table ever & refused to move us even though we asked them to & there were other tables available.  We were in the middle of traffic & the table was so small that we had to put things on the floor to fit our food. The food was fair, the service was fair & the margaritas were quite tasty but I thought overpriced at $12.  The kicker was when they added an 18% tip for a party of two with no notification. We usually tip a minimum of 20% & found this insulting & a little underhanded.  We are locals & we will not be returning & will not be recommending this place.
3;After going to Square Cafe twice during peak brunch times, I have resolved to come early in the morning, which is perfect. Nice selection of breakfast items from your sweet to savory and for reasonable prices though I feel like they have changed the menu recently so that there are less items. Anyway I don't get the name of the cafe but there are shapes (not just squares) painted on the ceiling in bold colors with local art work hanging so it is a comfortable atmosphere. \n\nThe service has been good - coffee is always filled (cups that the coffee come in are shaped interestingly cool) and the waitresses check in at reasonable times with a smile on their face. They are there to get you in and out with a full belly due to the volume of customers.\n\nI've eaten quite a few of their scrambles and omlettes along with their home fries and toast. The combinations of the flavors work well and homefries don't need any additional seasoning unless ketchup. Pancakes are fluffy and sweet, love how there is a dallop of whipped butter and whip cream. I have yet to have the french toast but my boyfriend always orders them with strawberries.\n\nThis is a staple breakfast place for us.
1;So this is a mom and pop place in a not so great neighborhood.  We decided to give it a try since our favorite Korean place closed down and it is close to Nellis Base.  The name implies that they are known for fish and chips?  We didn't try it but maybe we should have.  The place is small ( only 5 tables).  Very amateur decor.  They were friendly enough.  They do make food as you order and only take cash.  We ordered fried wontons, egg rolls, spicy pork bulgogi, and mild beef bulgogi.  The wontons weren't Very flavorful.  The egg rolls were mushy and bland.  The bulgogi was just ok.  Barely.  We have been to Korea and this just wasn't good.  It was $40 for both of us.  A bit high for low quality.  We will continue our search for good Korean food.
0;Take a minute to brainstorm everything you hate about Walmart.  Every generic , stereotypical thought you can come up with about this corporation.  Go ahead, I'll wait a little longer...\n\nThis Walmart embodies every single one of those stereotypes.  There is nothing good I can say about this place.  Ok, maybe one good thing: the people watching here is top notch.  Especially on a Friday night (or the 1st of the month).\n\nI have been to this Walmart 3 times.  I refuse to ever go again.  It is seriously that bad.  This is no exaggeration.  You have been warned.
1;Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.  \n\nI had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!
4;I had a gold pendant with diamonds made by Alex - simple, unusual and beautifully unique. I love one of a kind pieces and this was superb. I recommend anyone living or visiting to come to his shop in Old Town Scottsdale. Simply exquisite!
2;Limited menu, high prices... tasty but not filling. I probably won't go back, but that shouldn't stop you from at least trying it.
1;I guess I really just dont like buffets in this town.  The prime rib was so salty.  I would stay away just pay the extra money and hit the steak house.
2;It's OK, I'm not going to go out of my way raving about it, but it was definitely better than Strip Burger.  At least this seems like hand pressed beef, where Stip Burger uses the preformed SYSCO patties.  The bar for me is The Great Grille from Burbank, unfortunately they are long closed due to the owner passing.  If you have your choice, go to In-N-Out or Tommys!  $40 for two including shakes, a soda, and twofer or whatever it was.  The basket of fries and rings.
4;We had a great experience here! Wonderful western decor inside and out. This was their 6th Anniversary celebration so they were blowing up tons of balloons. They brought a basket of bread with mini corn muffins and dinner rolls before the meal. My spouse ordered the French Dip and I had the Chicken pizza. His sandwich was served hot and stuffed with meat. He liked the sweet potato fries and marshmallow cinnamon dip. We both had passion tea. My pizza was made fresh and was a true artisan pizza. Very unique. It was our first time in so we were treated to cotton candy (cherry cheesecake flavor) for dessert which is quite a nice and different added touch. The portions are large so we took boxes home. Our server was Steve and he was very attentive. The manager came by and introduced himself. The place wasn't busy but there were people coming and going. Priced at about $20-30 per person depending on what is ordered. We would recommend this place to our friends & look forward to returning. No complaints means 5 stars!
3;"Slightly embarrassed to say I have never been to this place intoxicated and am still giving a 4 star review.  \n\nMy husband (a U of I grad) and I have been here 4 times over the course of the past few years and have never been disappointed aside from the less than sanitary bathrooms midday.  The least exciting menu option (in my humble opinion) is my husband's favorite, that being the hasbrown, sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  I try something new everytime, and I even felt compelled to buy a \""What the F\"" shirt.   Word."
4;Recently went there with some friends for a Sunday brunch, and everything we ate was amazing.  I had the short rib benedict, and was amazed at how tender the beef was.  The bloody mary was spot on, too.\nTheir manager came over to our table to check on us, and spent some time explaining the the other things they have which we didn't order.  I guess they change their menu quite often (but please don't take away the rib benedict!)\nAll in all, a filling, tasty brunch.  Would go back.
4;This place is wonderful! We had a cast party there. The woman refilling our appetizers just overheard my friend ask if there was anything I could eat (because I'm vegetarian) and she immediately said she would bring out some vegetarian appetizers. They did the lettuce wraps and quesadilla vegetarian and they  were delicious and had a vegetarian protein source (cashews in the lettuce wrap).
1;"I'm sad right now. I wanted to like this place so badly. I wanted to have the positive experience others did and be able to happily write about it on yelp. Hubby and I went last weekend; got all dressed up, left the kids at home and took the date car. People watching was great, service was great, even our table location was great. The bar area was great. I loved the atmosphere. Did not mind it being dark at all because it was so cool inside. \nWhat was NOT great? Pretzel bread was a little stale but butter, lots of it, helped. The seafood tower was impressive, but the seafood adorning it was not so much. The Clear Lobster roll was outright INEDIBLE. Mushy, no flavor, disappointing.\nMy mambo salad was passable but nothing great.  When I asked for shrimp on top, after hearing so many great reviews about the shrimp, they gladly obliged. BUT when it came, they were overcooked and rubbery. WAH for me. Husband's steak was very good. He was gloating for sure. \nWe got two sides, the Crab Truffle Gnocchi and the peas. The gnocchi was decent but I really could only have a couple of bites due to the intense richness with nothing to offset it. The peas, while super fresh, were SWIMMING in oil. Seriously, they took great peas and drowned them to death in a sad, sad oil lake. \nThe butter cake was superb. Nothing but fond memories of that. \nSo, we spent a small fortune for a meal with one (for me) or two (for hubby) great points. \nI will not be going back. I will not be recommending. We live in Mesa, and were the first of our circle of influence to go and I am devastated to be the one steering people away due to such a lackluster first showing. \nI wonder what went wrong. So many other yelpers just love this place."
2;Honey Bear's BBQ has a few great BBQ options. For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere.\n\nAs far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.\n\nHoney Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.\n\nPro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer.
1;"Mike really wanted to go to Yard House, despite bad food experiences the first two times he'd been and the fact that it was 20 miles away. Said Mike, \""Yeah, I keep giving them a chance hoping things will change.\""\n\nChuck, the first waiter, was terrific.  Great personality and just a fun guy.  When we got switched to Molly, however, mmm, not so much.  Not her fault really, but she's no Chuck.   \n\nRick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked. \n\nThe pizza appetizer was just ok, at best, and the Chinese something-or-other was bad as well.  As for the entrees, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were undercooked and the mosh stuff in the middle (oro pasta plus god-knows-what) wasn't very appealing either.  \n\nI absolutely would not recommend this place to any friends and if Eck insists on going back there again, I'll stage a mini-coup and vote him down."
0;DO NOT GO HERE! Worst customer service EVER! I paid to go thru the car wash TWICE...when I got done..my car had just as many bugs on the front of it along with dirt as though I had not even gone through. Needless to say I was not happy. I asked a manager to come look and he told me that that there was nothing he could do because I didn't buy their expensive wash. I asked if I could at least have one of the paper towels they give out to try and wipe the bugs off. He said 'No', those were for people who bought the $5 wash. I was like really, I just paid $6 and you won't give me one. 'No, nothing I can do to help you.' REALLY?  Guess I'll just use the free vacuums and get washed elsewhere.
0;"Williamson Bikes is probably the worst bike store I have ever done business with (I do a lot of business with bike stores.)  I bought many bike parts and bikes from Williamson way back when they first opened, just off of Williamson Street, Del (the owner) in my opinion is as dishonest as the day is long.  He rips off customers, does dishonest \""repairs\"" and doesn't back up his service.  Glad to see this place close - fewer people will be ripped off by the highly arrogant owner."
4;I'm giving this five stars for a few different reasons.   We did the turtle feeding experience and were very impressed. We were shown through the facility in the back area and it was very well kept.  Our guide was efficient in explaining the way everything worked and showing us the pumps, tanks, etc. We were able to talk with the aquarists about the different sea life and feeding habits. Watched them feed the sharks as well. Very informative experience. Everyone was super nice.  We even got three free pictures of ourselves feeding the turtles.   As for the aquarium it's self it was very neat. It is small and kind of expensive so look for coupons.
3;"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor."
2;"Surprisingly good food.  I only write \""surprisingly\"" because this place positions itself as a Vegas Style BBQ joint, and as a Las Vegas local of 17 years I know that my town isn't known for its 'cue.\n\nThe food is good with a twist of different.  To date I've sampled their pulled pork, quarter chicken (white), and the Sassy Fries.  It's certainly barbecue-y, but not in a Carolina, Memphis, or KC way... so I suppose it is appropriate to ascribe \""Vegas Style\"" to this place.\n\nTheir meat offerings are tender and well-seasoned, and the fries are mighty good, but the one thing that was a bit off-putting was the consistency of the barbecue sauce.  It was, well, watery and thin.  Good, mind you, but quite runny and transparent.\n\nThe next time I go I'm going to ask if they offer dry versions of their meat.  Unfortunately, however, I fear that wet is the only way they prepare their fare.\n\nPrice-wise, the place is pretty cheap, especially when compared to other BBQ joints I've been to around the nation.  \n\nAt any rate, I'd go back if I needed some BBQ in a pinch and didn't have time to drive several miles to Buzz BBQ on West Craig Rd.  I still prefer the way Memphians get it done in Tennessee, but nevertheless..."
3;Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere.  Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great.  The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed.
1;"I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.\n\nIts not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?\n\nAs stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. \""I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes\"". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. \n\nFOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure."
1;The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
4;"My first Michael Mina.\n\nAfter learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, my friends and I decided to eat at Michael Mina's Seablue.  I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nThe four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The \""bread\"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nBy the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue \""paella\"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!\n\nOur waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.\n\nThis was the best meal I have had this year.\nYay (fellow Marin resident) Michael Mina!!"
0;"The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was \""That's not possible.\"" Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack."
1;OK so your a noodle place...I did not see one sign of making the noodles or do they.? Had chicken lo mein but did not see the chicken I asked and was told its there.....Oh really   sure it is... And that and a  million dollars and you will win the Lotto.As I tasted the bowl of noodles there was a strong vinegar taste . Not sure if I have ever had Lo mein that had a Vinegar taste  still trying to figure that one out.\n            Maybe pickles got dropped in the noodles?As you can see not many people for lunch but, there was a long line next door at Zaxbys?The King of fast food HUH?
3;My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today to get deluxe pedicures! We both have jobs where we are on our feet all day and good pedis are a must for us. The salon is nice and very clean. The staff is friendly but a little forgetful. This place would have gotten five stars but there were a couples of problems. First off make an appt here! They were so busy! My boyfriend and I sat with our feet in the water for an hour before they started our pedis! Sitting and soaking for 20 mins is ideal for me but an hour!? Even I was getting bored and impatient! Second, they were rather overwhelmed and over filled my boyfriends pedi bowl soaking our shoes and my purse on the floor! And then they didn't bother to clean up the water! And lastly even though my bf and I both got deluxe pedis they did not do the same things for both of us. I don't know if they just customize the service depending on your needs or what but it really just seemed like my bf's nail girl skipped his salt scrub and mine skipped my leg massage. Overall, it was a good pedi. Our toenails look perfect, clean and shaped. Our feet are soft and smooth, that cheese grater really worked! I was nervous about it, but it was not uncomfortably and my feet really needed it. Okay selection of polish but I think I will bring my own next time if I want a specific color. We will be back but next time with appts.
0;"I booked this hotel room hoping for a \""4 star experience\"" in Las Vegas. When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to \""upgrade\"" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description. \nMoral: not all \""deals\"" from hotwire leads to a happy ending.\nBlah."
3;Go yard or go home! The strawberry and mango flavor is refreshing. I usually like pina coladas but the miami vice didn't have the same kick of the strawberry and mango. If you could put fun in a bottle...it would come in a yard size.
1;My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular.  So why the 2 star rating?\n\nThe service was absolutely awful.  This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night.  By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down.  My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order.  The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food.  Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages.  We came back and my food was just coming out.  Hers was nowhere to be seen.  It was another half hour before it came out.  I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order.  Absolutely crazy!\n\nMy wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait.
3;Best patio in town.  Only visited once so far.  Food above average and the menu has a good variety that goes beyond basic bar food. Service and the patio were A+.  The place just has a cool vibe to it.  Can't wait to go back.
4;Just happen to be going for a show and decided to reserve table at Orange Sky.  I had been there several times before to sit in one of the private booths overlooking the city which I highly recommend especially for special occasions.  This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...\n\nI am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!
3;I have seen every exhibit that has come through here in the last 5 years.  There are a few misses, but most are hits.  \nStart at the top and work your way down.  And don't forget to use the photobooth before you go.\nThe Weekend Factory is great for kids- the studio in the basement is open for visitors to make some art to take home with them.
2;Great little brunch spot. All local and organic food. Service was friendly, atmosphere was a little lacking. Will definitely go back.
1;The hotel feels old in general. It has this heavy perfume which we didn't care about, but can probably get annoying.\nNo WIFI, no coffee machine in the room. Not a big deal unless you're traveling with a baby and you're forced to spend $2.50 at Starbucks each time you need a cup of warm milk.\n\nWe didn't purchase early check-in, so we left our luggage at the bell desk. When we came back, we had to wait 15 min for the guy to get our bags out of the room, because he was eating a sandwich. He later explicitly complained about us not tipping him.\n\nThe TV reset its volume every night, and lowering it with the remote just made it jump to max, then go down very slowly. Also it was difficult to find real TV channels among all the hotel's self-advertising crap (which includes messages on the room phone)\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nothing special, although the slanted windows and the Egyptian themed furniture were cool.\n\nSecurity was extremely annoying about having the baby in the casino. We never had the baby near us while playing, and still we got warned.\n\nThe restaurants at the Luxor have pretty low ratings on Yelp, so we only tried Backstage Deli, which was quite disappointing.\n\nThe monorail seems like it was made to confuse people. It only stops at the Luxor when going north, which means it's faster to walk from the Excalibur and to the Mandalay.\n\nGood value for the price, but I don't think I'm booking this hotel again.
2;For our first meal in Vegas, we decided to go Mexican. After walking around the Miracle Mile Mall, this was the first thing that caught our eye. Location wise, it's probably not the best considering you'd have to go all the way around the one mile mall to get to where it is. \n\nChatty staff, good service and an awesome selection of food (platters, wraps, burgers, sandwiches etc). I ordered the Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap and Chips and Salsa. My friend got the BBQ Chicken Wings. My wrap had chunks of avocado, which wins big bucks in my book. I love avocado especially if it's integrated nicely into a dish. It makes me very happy. It was quite a portion actually. One of my concerns was that it was quite greasy. But I guess I can't expect a lot from fast food. I wasn't aware that there was going to be a side of chips (which I believe were deep fried, hand cut potatoes). If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the side of chips and salsa. No biggie on those, just chips and salsa. \n\nThe wings were also just ordinary. It wasn't bad but it wasn't to die for either. \n\nI like the nice island in the middle of the store that held all the dips and sauces. I thought that was pretty cool. There was a nice variety that patrons can enjoy.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part about this store was the line up that leads to the alcoholic drink orders (there was a line for non alcoholic orders and a line for alcoholic orders). They have these really tall plastic containers that held slushie drinks. I got the smallest one, which was a half yard long slushie drink, (double shot of course) named Happy Ending. I loved it so much I came back for seconds. Really great for those days when you walk down the strip and its 35 degrees hot out. \n\nOh and if you save your drink container and bring it next time to get your drink, it's cheaper. Some people actually brought theirs back. I should have, but seeing as I was drunk for virtually the entire trip, I don't remember where I put my first container so I just got another one.\n\nWould I come back? Probably for the food. Definitely yes for the drink. Me wants me Happy Ending.
2;3.5, but more of a 3 than a 4 so I'll round down.\n\nThanks to Groupon, I was well fed for the rest of the day for only $8.\n\n- Smoked Turkey w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Honey Oat Bagel: WIN!!!\n- Ham w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Whole Wheat Bagel: LOSE (ham was too salty)\n- Chicken Salad on Whole Wheat: LOSE (too much sodium)\n- Coffee: Not a win, not a lose either\n\nI'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu (and to use up my other Groupon offers). \n\nAs far as the service goes, I didn't have any issues with the workers there. They weren't overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either.
3;Wow I love to Thrift shop. It's so fun to go to Goodwills when I'm traveling. So many different things. This store was huge! So much bigger then the ones near my home town. I could have spent along time going through the clothes. They were very busy Nd there racks were stuffed. The prices are doubled compared to my hometown Goodwills. Maybe because it's Vegas. Shirts in my area run for 3.95 a piece this store look liked 5 dollars and up. Still reasonable but that is my only complaint.
3;Very good pizza and service, impressed so i went back the next weekend and ordered 3 more pizzas. Friends liked them too. Favorite so far is the delux and then the pepperoni
3;I have a ball every time I go to Ak-Chin Pavilion but I think the level of enjoyment one experiences often depends on the state of mind. Doesn't hurt to remember that you're in the same place as thousands of other people and your experience is not dependent on them, but rather on YOU.\n\nAk-Chin is an outdoor amphitheater in the middle of BFE where everyone drives, parks for free, attends a great concert, then tries to leave at the same time and get upset about it. My friends and I try to be somewhat responsible and book a nearby hotel and use a taxi service to get to the concert. When the concert is over, just walk to the QuikTrip on the corner right outside of Ak-Chin and catch a cab back to the hotel. It saves us the headache of trying to navigate our way out of the lot which can take a good hour. \n\nAk Chin puts on a great show with fantastic sound and great projection screens. We  paid for actual seats in a section for Blake Shelton but quickly realized the better way to go is with lawn seats. Lawn seats were my first choice but someone in my party wanted to be closer. When I'm at a concert, I'm pretty much dancing and singing as are all the people on the lawn. Not everyone in my section felt the music in the same fashion and stayed seated for most of the show so my girls and I got a few looks but truth be told, I paid the same amount of money as they did and if I want to show my enthusiasm by standing and dancing, I'm gonna do it. But from now on, I'll stick with the lawn. It's a better crowd anyway.\n\nDrink prices are no more than any other concert venue and there are plenty of choices, even a tequila bar. Better food would be nice though. A hard pretzel for $3.50 and cheese sauce for an additional $4 is a little steep. I'd pay quite a bit more to have a decent meal from a local restaurant down in the food and drink area. \n\nMisters cool the crowd down in the food and drink area which is very welcome because it gets HOT jamming out in the middle of summer!
0;One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Terrible service.  They forgot to bring out silverware after serving our salads.  They brought out our dinner literally 90 seconds after serving us our appetizer.  Then they brought out a meal we did not order.  Now for the food.  The lasagna was swimming in an ocean of sauce that tasted worse than the sauce you get in a supermarket.  My meatball sandwich had a grand total of one and a half meatballs  (three halved meatball slices) on the entire sandwich and my daughter could not eat her chicken fingers because they did not taste right.  How can you mess up chicken fingers?
2;"Not bad.\nOne star: Impressive lay out. \nTwo stars: The clams were awesome. \nThree stars: Quick to pick up dirty dishes at the table. Hubby had the prime rib and he thought it was decent. \nOne star deducted because they were stingy with the cut of prime rib (I could almost see through his slice. Just saying)\nOne star deducted: THEIR \""CREME BRULEE\"" IS LIKE CREME BRULEE ON DOWNERS! Gross and disappointing! Do NOT be fooled. Ugh."
2;"Just returned from a much anticipated visit to Pig and Pickle...much to my disappointment I write this in hope that those antiicipating thier own visit heed the warning.Following a long day as a bartender addressing the needs of others I eagerly awaited enjoying some new vittles and a new local place .When arriving I was greeted by a very pleasant and joviall bartender Scott...quite a treat. Ordered the croquet sammie and a glass of vino. Asked for house wine and was informed that a pinot noir was the only option....so noir it was. I texted a friend and informed her I was at P n P and feel free to come over and have a drink/nibble. My friend arrived and was literally not acknowledged for 10 minutes. Scott was no where in site. There was a man who we later found out was one of the owners behind the bar...not friendly...not attentitive ...certainly not a reason to visit. Earlier when he asked how was my food I stated the food was good but the temp was lukewarm and I would prefer hotter.Clearly he was NOT interested in my feedback and opinions as he scurried off and remained aloof and unavailable. Scott returns and we share  our disappointment with him...he is gracious and apologetic.....we press on, When presenting our check the owner bartender informs us that he has given us the industry discount( awesome) until my friend realizes that she has been charged 12$ for whatshe hoped to be a cheap glass of house wine....much to our shegrin the noir was not . All in all here it is....nice location...nice ambiance, food was flavorful, Scott was a consumate pro, the prices food wise were reasonable...they need a more affordable wine selection for  the working class. I am sad ...I had high hopes. I was  not at all impressed with the surly arrogance of the \""owner bartender\"" .He alone,was a deterrent to wanting to return regardless of the food and or drinks. Thumbs down on this experience~ Perhaps wait a minute...let them figure out the error of thier ways and this place maystand a chance-"
2;"What can be said about Kaba Curry? No, really. What do I say about it? There's nothing remarkable or memorable about it. It is a little place in the commons building that serves Japanese/Hawaiian style curry dishes. It's... curry. With rice. Sometimes other things. I know I'm being overly descriptive but that's just what it's mustering out of me. I mean just take some curry, pick a solid ingredient, and combine. I've just summed up Kaba.\n\nI do remember kind of a cool idea - a curry \""grilled cheese\"" sandwich. Just curry poured between a couple slices of white bread. There is potential here but it needs WAY more.\n\nIf you're in the area, really want curry, but don't want to go to Chinatown (and probably get it a little cheaper) then this is your spot."
4;This place is great!  As someone mentioned, its a refurbished Wendy's.  It brings an old school feel to it, they have done great work on the interior.  You can use the drive thru window to pick up to-go orders.  Awesome.\n\nEvery time I have ordered here the food has been fantastic.  I always find myself going back to the Pad Thai!   The best thai in the area and quite possibly the best thai I have had in Phoenix.  Also a locally owned restaurant, support this place!
2;"You should have some dessert here. I think ever since Fluff Ice came to Foodie Fest last year (velvety, perfect snow ice), this \""snow ice\"" caught on, but in lame and half-assed ways. You can get this stuff at Icy Juicy and Easy Life, but it just isn't the same. Not bad, but not the real deal. Anyway, having tried Kuma - I think they're the first in a wave of \""acceptable.\""\n\nFast service, rather tasty snow ice, and just enough toppings. I had the regular snow ice flavor with lychee, coconut, mochi, and strawberry syrup. I was a fan. I don't think it was too sweet, surprisingly, while being covered in sugar. This is a matter of opinion I suppose. I also sampled the taro, which tastes like taro. Surprise!\n\nIf you're a fan of this stuff already, you'll enjoy it enough because it's pretty much your only choice in reasonable distance. If you want the good stuff, you'll have to make the trip out to Frost Bites."
2;this airport confuses me when i get off the plane in vegas. i always forget that i have to take the tram to get to the baggage claim area / out the airport. i like how it is so easy to find the restroom right when i get off the plane. LOL\n\ni like how this airport has some last minute gambling or start your gambling right when you land into vegas. i remember one time my friend and i were stuck at the airport due to a delayed in our flight -- we were at the slot machines to pass by time. \n\nyou have to remember that there are 2 exits -- the exit closest to the baggage claim is where the shuttle is. and the exist away from the baggage claim is where the taxi line is. i was so lost and confused when i step out the airport looking for a taxi. i exited to the shuttle area and had to walk back into the airport to the taxi area. Getting a taxi was super easy. There is a a line and the line moves pretty quick since every taxi is waiting for business. \n\ni hate how the gates to my flight was so far away from the security area. it was seriously a 10 min walk!
3;"We come here all of the time to eat and go to the movies and we finally had time to ourselves and booked a room for the night. Overall the hotel was great and we had no issues. We parked at valet, checked in easily and made our way to our room. You have to have your room key to use the room elevator so don't lose your key!\n\nThe room was spacious; we had a king bed. We were on the 10th floor and realized walking down our hall that our view was going to be the parking lot at Costco or the parking structure for the hotel. It was the latter. My husband only gives me the best.\n\nI didn't pack toothpaste  and they didn't have any in our bathroom so I called downstairs and they brought up 2 dental kits. Nice.\n\nI took a hot bath while watching the results to AGT. There was a tv above the faucet in the tub and the tv was actually pretty crappy. The remote didn't even work and I'm thinking maybe it's been dropped in the tub too many times? This tub was awesome though. It wasn't a roman tub but it was rectangular and super deep. I honestly floated in this thing.\n\nI used the gym once. It is on the ground floor where the spa is. There is a tv attached to every elliptical, bicycle, and treadmill. They offer ear buds for listening to the TVs but I declined. There were a lot of machines and a lot of weights. They provide towels and bottles of water at every machine and there is a side table full of cold water. I liked the gym. Now I need to go back and try the spa.\n\nWe ate at Hachi for dinner and the buffet for breakfast.\n\nWe had a really nice experience here and I can't wait to come back for another night or two!"
3;"Everybody's got their own opinion of Amelie's, so let me make mine to-the-point:\n\nDecor - love it. Unique, fun, and eclectic. My girlfriend thinks it's adorbs. I like it cuz it doesn't look like every other damn place in town.\n\nSavory food - like it. The sandwiches are AMAZING, as is the quiche. The salad choices are fine, but they don't really do anything that would be considered an entree.\n\nBakery - Also like it. Everything Amelie's does is wonderful. You are *required* to try the chocolate torte sometime before you die. There is no option here. The twice-baked croissant makes me masticate just thinking about it. The tea cakes are om-nom-arrific. The French macarons are excellent. However, Amelie's commits a major cardinal sin here that I simply can't avoid writing about: THEY LEAVE THE FRENCH MACARONS IN THE FRIDGE ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, seriously, who the FUCK decided this was a good idea?! Have they never had real macarons before?! Now, I know what you're thinking: \""Aubrey, not *everybody* knows how a macaron should taste.\"" That's true, gentle reader, but if you're going to fucking make macarons for people to purchase and consume, you should know how they're stored / kept fresh. Any other way, and you might as well hold your glaring deficiencies out for the world to see. In this case, Amelie's is walking around with a hideous facial birthmark.\n\nCoffee - meh. Ees okay. Not great. The melange riche is burnt-tasting, while the house roast is better, but still thin and bland."
0;"Great ambiance? My half blind grandmother could put together better low lighting with ikea lights than this place.  $11 cocktails with well alchohol? Do I look 15 to you, that you think I cant tell the difference between a plastic bottle of vodka and a vodka that should be in a cocktail that merits an $11 price tag?  I've been to many of the great \""cocktail\"" bars in many different cities (The Whistler in Chicago being the best).  Worst of all, we leave there after sitting in a corner booth on a not busy night, my girlfriend realizes she forgot her phone there and we return not 5 minutes later and the phone is mysteriously \""missing\"" yet the same lighter she had in her purse is sitting conveniently on the bar. right. I recommend never going to this place, I'm sure I could probably get a better drink in prison"
0;The horrific experience that I had here a few months ago popped into my head, so I figured that I'd write a quick review. I'm happy to see that it had closed because i would NEVER have gone back.  It wasn't that the pizza was mediocre, it was that it was just plain bad.  So much so that i threw out an entire large pizza after eating just one slice.  Major disappointment.
3;Cheba Hut had a vision from an Amsterdam trip and is growing the dream to legally sell Chronic, ATF, Kush and more. \n\n   I get the special of the day because this is a rare place were most of the sandwiches are worth the try.  I also treat my self to a rice Krispy treat.  The restaurant has been seen as a great concept and can be found in many states. Its great to see a business find success with a Hippy concept.  \n\nErik T. thinks Subway is great, go ahead man yelp about all the great subways in AZ I can't wait to read them.
1;Seeing how the one in Chandler closed we drove to the one in Mesa.  Came early 4:30 pm  for dinner on Sunday.  We sat in the bar in one of the booths for dinner.  Order was taken promptly by bar person.  While waiting for food we had the house wine ($3.00 per glass at happy hour) it was very good.  The food took 30 min to arrive.  Food was good although portions were a bit small.  The bread and olive oil was very good.    Restaurant was almost empty you would think the service would be better.  Never saw the manager to check on us.  They need to step it up a notch.
1;well we had breakfast here...... big mistake...... the hostess was taking a waiting list, our friend jim tryed to give him his name to put down... the lady had to repeat jim back to him 3 times cause she didnt understand english, finally she wrote down GIAM, ?? wtf.... after waiting 1 hour just to be sat , we found we were being skipped due to her poor language barrier, and then we weresat.........\n\nThe food? yep, worst than dennys... need i say more? naw im good.
4;Eastfield Bar and Grill has a very friendly staff. Yummy food. My family loves the chicken fingers. Clean.
0;"This place is bait n switch unless you know what crooks you are working with and know how to handle them . Of course I'll share my experience and give you some tips !\n\nSome customers literally took 30-45 minutes at the counter while the clerks here tried to up sell every thing possible, gps, gas, insurance, car seat to people who obviously have no kids . Time is money! Efficiency is key! 2 sayings that have never been uttered in this building obviously.\n\nPeople you know they will ask you for your drivers license and credit card... Have it ready before you are next in line . Also have your confirmation number pulled up on your phone or on your print out ready to go... Come on!\n\nWhen I heard those golden words \""Next customer\"" I felt like I hit the lotto. I passed the confirmation number to the clerk which was pulled up on my phone, and handed her my license and credit card. The next thing she said was do you was basic or premium coverage. Wait... What did u just ask me? What kinda question was that? Did you really just try to pull a fast one on me? Is that what they teach you during your training !!? Is that how you tricked those poor young girls into speaking with you for 45 minutes, holding up the line that was already going out the door?? I snapped back at her I don't want any coverage, no extras, I'll get my own gas, nothing additional!! My contract was printed immediately and I was out within 1-2 minutes. I think I set a record that day for being the fastest one out of the rental counter.\n\nComplaints about taking 2 shuttles you say... If you look at the location, you can see they are obviously located further away than most rental agencies..\n\nYes I'm herra asian so I will be back here to save my $40, but don't get tricked into any up charges and don't let these folks waste your time either. Come prepared !"
3;Out of Business!
1;Average manga themed ramen spot in Chinatown Vegas next to Asian restaurants and an AYCE Japanese sushi restaurant and ayce KBBQ place.  I say manga theme because the cute waitresses wear colorful wigs and Japanese cartoon outfits modeled after Anime magazines and the menu has Spicy! and Hot! popping out at you in cartoonish fonts.  That's the biggest draw, though, because the food itself was somewhat bland and it took a long time for it to come out.  I got the miso ramen and split an order of kim chi fried rice and karaage chicken, but my ramen tasted bland and wasn't too exciting.  The chicken was too oily and the meat was dry but crispy.  The fried rice was just ok too but not that memorable.  I don't mean to nitpick, I guess I was expecting some pop out at you flavor and excitement from a cartoon themed restaurant.  I wanted to like it, it's a cute place and the waitresses are really cute.  I suppose a huge anime or video game fan (otaku?)  would be crazy about this place and want to try everything on the menu whenever they were in town.  They also serve boba.
3;Victoria Street is one of the best streets in Edinburgh for shopping individuality and general quirkiness. Swish fits in well amongst the mix of boutiques and random outlets, and specialises in retro bags and t-shirts for men and women, although there is a really sweet section at the front with a lot of cute garments, which are mostly on the girly side.\n\nMessenger bags in different designs, Gola bags in a ton of colours, plus some girlier handbags in some very funky, patterned designs. There are also various jazzed up laptop covers, other little items scattered around to give as gifts, and my personal favourite, the t-shirts. The t-shirt designs in here are very cool, and just that little bit different.
0;"A big FU to the waitress last night at the Carolina Ale House in Downtown Charlotte.  First, my two beer glasses were filthy. No apology, no acceptance of responsibility.  Second, we ordered wings and we were never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, a very typical side item.  You also failed to provide plates for the bones.  Third, when I ordered a simple cheese burger, I told the waitress exactly what I wanted. She came back with all of those specific items missing and asked if there was anything else I would like.  I politely responded by mentioning those items and she said she would be right back, so I waited.  15 minutes later, my burger is too cold to enjoy.  When she caught my eye, she said she remembered and will go get those items.  I said, never mind, just take my food and bring me the check, I'm done here.  \n\nHowever, I still felt obligated to tip.  Because, if I didn't tip, I'm sure she would have walked away and said; 'there goes another nigger that does not tip'.  And, I was not going to give her the satisfaction.  Besides, the bus boy and bartender did nothing wrong to lose my support.  So, she benefits because of them.  So, I gave the lowest amount I have in many years, 17%.  But, this waitress was f'n lousy.  Her name is Heather M (according to my sales receipt), so avoid her.  I'm sure the establishment is fine."
1;Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!
4;This is a great service, I have used this on three occasions to buy show tickets and tickets to exhibits. This really saves you a lot of money, in some cases 50% savings on a show or an exhibit. \n\nThe only downside is there always seems to be a long line to get the tickets, and when you buy your tickets you don't get a ticket, just a voucher which you have to go to the box office of the show to exchange for a ticket. The only problem I had with this is when I went to see an exhibit, waited in line for a half an hour for the voucher, then went to the actual exhibit and had to wait for another half hour for a ticket. But with the savings you get it is worth the hassle.
0;This is a review of the snack bar area. I love Target but the snack bar area is a freakin dump! Every single table right now is filthy and doesn't look like they have been cleaned all day. Gross...and they aren't even busy. I wish the health dist would pay thus slop hiuse a visit.
0;So we were hung up on again will trying to get the key the opportunity,to correct her problems. Very unprofessional if you sold equipment that work there would be no issue. If looking for appliances go to Home Depot or Lowe's
0;"I weep for humanity.\n\nWords like \""horrifying,\"" \""embarrassing,\"" and \""tragic\"" should be used when describing this culinary disaster.  Our group of four had to hunt to find anything edible just to get past the meal.  \n\nWe could taste the cheapness in the food.  It was like the dishes were assembled  in another country, frozen, shipped, accidentally thawed, re-frozen and then reheated for the Luxor's unsuspecting dining victims.  \n\nThe Luxor should be ashamed and management should be forced to eat here daily."
0;Way to ruin a good thing PTs!  Sitting here 5 min ,\nPlace used to have the best PBR on this side of town.  The renovations are nice.  LED lighting brightens up the bar but looks half ass installed.  Nice pool table area where the restaurant side used to be.  Yep no more good breakfasts with the family.And the very worst! This place used to have the best steak sandwiches in town. Now it's some processed and high amount of preservatives.  Steak was grey !   The corporate monster strikes again.
0;We were also one of the customers who used the restaurant.com coupon. I had been to this place once before and thought it ok enough to return. Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor. We tried to get their attention but they ignored us. We finally got up and grabbed towels to clean it up... only when we did this did they take notice. \n\nI will never go back to this place.
3;Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.  \n\nFirst, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\n\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. \n\nThird, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \n\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \n\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.  \n\nOverall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)
2;Went here last week for the first time for a brow wax. First thing my waxer did was complain that she had just burned the roof of her mouth on hot queso she'd scrapped off the bottom of a crock pot. Not too alarming except for the fact that her job requires the exact same skill set to apply hot wax on people's faces! Um, let's use some common sense and not scare away your customers. Moving on.
4;Yum!! Thanks to Yelpers I had a great breakfast every day here! We stayed at THEHotel at Mandalay and I used yelp to find a decent place to have breakfast. I'd recommend. They have a mimosa buffet breakfast on Sundays with an amazing bloody Mary! We ate here Sat and Sunday. Sunday had the omelet bar with premium ingredients (i.e. crab, asparagus) and each day they had someone making baby donuts and hand dipping them in front of you with different toppings! I want to go back!
2;Great pizza, weird menu set up. I would have though that a pizzeria would have their own little creative pizzas, but they dont. They give you a 8 1/2 by 22 inch menu that has plain pizza sizes and prices then toppings below that are $2 each , salads , sodas, desserts. We ordered a small pepporoni with ricotta cheese, DEEELICIOUS!!!\n\nOur waitress, very blah. I'm in the bar industry and i dont know if she was having a bad day or just hated her job but she def. wasn't attentative as she should have been. I had a cranberry juice and a water and both were empty most the time, she never refilled my drinks, I had to ask the busser to do it and it happily did it. Also, I noticed she delieved pizzas to her other tables and put a piece of pizza on each persons plates at the tables but ours....no big deal but again, strange. She also never made eye contact when talking to us, which I found odd.. I'll probably go to the straight to the bar next time, or get pizza to go.\n\n\nA Plus, Tuesdays are 1/2 off wines! I went on a Tuesday but unfortunantly for me I was taking the day off from drinking lol.
2;Food was good but the service sucked. They stopped checking on us and we had to go to the front of the house to pay our bill. Not really happy at all with the service.
1;So first off you need to make an appointment for David's Bridal really? So I called and scheduled an appointment for 5:30 on a Weds eve I arrive at 5:30 &/ told them I had made an appointment first they couldn't find it then they said oh never mind we did & by the way you're consultant is working with another bride so you will have to wait ? Well why did I make an appointment then I asked ? they took me back and grabbed some dresses for me to try on and the girl didn't even help I got the gowns on myself so why do we need appointment? I think this place is trying to compete in a market of giving great customer service where they failed miserably the girl told me after I was there 10 min she was off in 30 min but no rush ? So why tell me then you're off when I had scheduled appointment and had to wait very disrespectful of my time not helpful i would not recommend. If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience .
4;The food here is amazing and consistent. Love the noodles, chicken and seafood. We stop here every time we are in town.
1;"awful.  and this coming from someone who gives every place pretty much a four or five star review.  pizza was ok.  employees were nice enough.  but the parents who go here use it as free day care.  kids were running around everywhere, beating up on each other.  my kids, who are no angels, but know how to behave, were horrified.  parents came up to us afterwards and said \""sorry\"" - uhhhhh, too late, you think?  the owners need to screen parents and their kids before allowing them to come here.  this was not a mellow experience.  i still have nightmares."
3;Outstanding. This place has a ton of variety! We tried both Breakfast (if you hit it right you get lunch stuff too!) and Dinner. Both were fantastic. \n\nDinner had an excellent mix of of cuisine types, tons and tons of delicious seafood...and all of the meat was great! I will agree with another reviewer...the Kobe was a little tough, but shit give it a shot anyway.  I mean it is a buffet at the Bellagio!!
0;"I want to thank Mike (Manager) at Famous Dave's at the Peoria Arizona location. I was part of a large group we have had our local dive club meeting there for the last 5-6 months. Mike was so nice as to tell us that he didn't need our business and we could go elsewhere to have our meeting! We found a great place called the \""Salty Senorita\"" awesome place! Thanks to Jordan and her crew!! We had a great meeting.. Thanks again to Mike"
4;"Just ate lunch here today and my husband and I were really blown away! I got a carne Asada taco and a carne Asada mini taco and the husband got two al pastor tacos. Just FYI the \""mini tacos\"" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the \""tacos\"" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place."
2;Went to see Arcade Fire here last night. was excited to check out the Joint since they moved it when remodeling Hard Rock. Saw a bunch of shows at the old one, but haven't got to too many shows since my kids were born. \n\nHad balcony seats which I expected to allow me to go onto the floor also, but it seems they charge more for that and keep you separated. Could have snuck on but whatever. Went up to balcony, back to our seats in 401 Row J seats 7,8 and after the first 2 songs sounding like DJ train wrecking, I thought either Arcade Fire got wasted in Vegas or the sound is sooooo bad in those seats. I had a feeling it was the latter as no speakers were close and it seemed like a lot of reverb getting in the way. \n\nSo we got up and walked up front to an opening by the railings on side, were we walked into balcony area. Much better sound. Better view too. Stayed there for rest of the show which was great. Arcade Fire was awesome live and sounded great in new spot. \n\nThe floor looked mobbed but I assume sounded good down there too. All in all there is nothing special or exciting about this place as a concert venue, and I would recommend either getting floor or standing up front in balcony. They need to buy separate speakers for balcony seats in back. Very Lame for someone who might not have known it was just bad place to be sound wise.
0;"Like any fast food place, the staff changes often. On a recent visit, husband walked out because he said the lettuce was brown and looked awful and the staff refused to provide fresh lettuce. Also, the turkey was so shredded, it was unrecognizable as such. The staff refused again to open a new chunk of turkey until the little nub left was used up. When my husband asked Iif maybe they could slice it thicker, the lady said she would charge extra! \n\nAdditionally, when I asked for extra onions, the man making my sandwich (who appeared to be the MANAGER) was rolling his eyes at other employees who were on a break in response to my request. I saw you do that you jerk; I'm not blind! Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!"
1;To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!
0;CUSTOMER BEWARE, this is a horrible outfit.  We took our car there for a regular wash, they left the windows open thru the wash, and broke the electronic holder completely off on a brand new Lexus, that cost over $100 and denied everything even though we had witnesses and a policemen right there.  Since it is a civil matter, we had to take them to court.  The lesson here is avoid unethical businesses, and that makes reviews like this one so much more usefully.   We ran into a previous customer that says this is normal operating procedure, and that he avoids this place, but comes here only for company car.  Not sure what to think but will NEVER come back under any circumstance.  OTHER CUSTOMER BEWARE.
1;Server was polite. Food was marginal and took waaay too long to come out. Beer selection very limited. The only thing that kept a smile on my face was watching ppl fall off of the mechanical bull.
0;Seriously?\n\nThey have a website.\n\nTheir website does not have their phone number.\nTheir website does not have their address.\nTheir website does not have a map.\n\nI'd be tempted to wonder why, but I suppose if that's an indication of their attention to detail I should just take the hint.
0;I don't know what all the hype is about.  \n\nI ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.  Holy bland!  I could have kicked myself for forking over $10 for it.\n\nOverrated!!
3;Went here last weekend. First thing they seat you and bring you pickles. This was very interesting. The food was great. Service was great. Breakfast menu has a lot of options. Will go back often. Ok have been back a few times lately and the food was not good. Came out cold both times and portions are smaller. Will be a long time till I go back.
1;It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible.
1;Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there.
3;Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito. \n\nThe chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter. \n\nWe are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise.
0;"Holy heck! This place was beyond bad. One star is too much. We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch. Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long. The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there. Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go. We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us. She said to wait while she found a table. I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever. While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, \""How many?\"" I responded, \""Someone is already helping us. She went to find a table.\"" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, \""How many?\"" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess. Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table. \n\nOur server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared. It took a very, very long time to get our drinks. While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks. They were very large photographs. There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu. When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks. We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra. The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids. I found this very weird and misleading. Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks?? My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old. \n\nWe placed our order and waited, and waited and waited. A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then. She'd just seen it was up and ready. Yeah, right. We continued to wait and wait and wait. Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there. I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow. I was just happy to have our food. We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time. We were now running late. \n\nOk, so the food...bleh!! It was sooo bad! My oldest son ordered the french toast. It was so soggy it was dough. My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through. My husband had the same issue. My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever. They were bland mush. I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms. It had mushrooms. I had ordered a side of fruit. It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one. Nice try. My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came. We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.  \n\nThis was truly a terrible experience and possibly the worst we've had in our four years in Las Vegas. We will not go back."
4;We expected a long wait after we read the reviews before heading over for breakfast on the 4th of July...great service! And great food. Farmer's omelettes, breakfast burrittos and pancakes. We were are really impressed! We look forward to going again. But, please... Don't let the secret out about this gem! LOL
2;Excellent service and presentation. Spectacular view. Wine list mostly a rip off although there are a few pearls hidden.\nSteak is mediocre and should be better from such a gorgeous high end restaurant (steaks tasted like choice not Prime in my opinion ). Not as good as last time I was here about 1 1/2 years ago.
1;I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. \n\nThe menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!
1;Meh. The food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive, but it was also boring. \n\nI'll never understand how so many Mexican restaurants can make refried beans bland.\n\nI've had much worse, but I've also had much better. It was worth a shot, but I probably won't be back.
3;Came to town for some training and wanted to try this place out. Not just because it was on Triple D but it got great reviews on Yelp too. I had The Five Spot with a side of homefries. The food was excellent, has to be the best breakfast sammich ever. The homefries are really good too, but the sammich was the best. Definitely worth checking out. I went on a Monday around 1 pm and the place was pretty full, but no wait. Its good enough to wait for though.
4;This is a great restaurant a little on the pricy side but it's very good the service was great and there is a lot of good people watching I was very intertained with the couples I saw coming in
3;I only ever really go there for the movies, but I have to say, I love it for a few reasons:\n\n1.  Newer and cleaner than most others I've been to\n2.  Better ventilation - walking through the casino to get to the movie theater doesn't mean lungs full of smoke for my kids and me.  Most other local casinos, you just get slapped in the face with the smoke as soon as you walk in. For me = instant migraine.  Not at Aliante.\n3.  I left my credit card in the movie theater ladies room once and didn't realize until a couple of hours after I left.  I called, and someone from the staff had found it and turned it in.  MAJOR POINTS for HONESTY!  I will never forget how helpful the movie theater manager was.\n4.  Easier to find your way around.  I get lost in almost every casino I go to, but this one's simple to navigate.
2;Went here for brunch because we had a voucher. Overall I was impressed by our meal. My husband and I ate outside on the patio which was very pleasant.  We ordered coffee (3.5) and I ordered a Bloody Mary  which was a little on the spicy side but tasted fresh and my husband ordered a mimosa ($6 each). We shared the seasonal fruit plate which has a nice variety of fruit  including strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, blackberries, and pineapples, but the melon was not ripe and some strawberries were over ripe ($8). I ordered the corned beef benedict ($11) and my husband ordered the classic benedict ($12). The corned beef was a little dry, but I should have expected that! The hollandaise was tart. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had! We made a reservation per our voucher request but the place was almost empty. I was disappointed that the Westin does not have complementary parking for its guests.
3;"Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles! That's what I get every time... It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall! The food is cooked up on a big grill in front of you (with a bit of performance usually thrown in by the cooks ~ \""yummy, yummy chickeeen!\""), so depending on the rotation of the chicken, you may have to wait 10 minutes or so for the chicken (or steak, I guess) to cook up. That's fine, as it's worth the wait for fresh food. The teriyaki chicken comes with some traditional veggies ~ bok choy, I think ~ and a very light sauce. However, they do use some vegetable oil, so don't expect this to be the lightest meal you've ever eaten. Surprisingly, I found some threads on the web of people dying to reproduce the recipe, so I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys Sarku every so often!\n\nOh, by the way, lots of folks get double meat, but with the soba, I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one, so I just get the regular meat portion. It is PLENTY.\n\nP.S. I've heard you can do double veggie instead of the rice normally served with the teriyaki. I might try that, but it's hard to say \""No\"" to soba noodles. : ("
4;"Why do you think you are entitled to be head judge of the best cooking competition on tv?  \n\nWhat gives you the right to chastise the contestants over every minute detail?\n\nWhat contributions have you made to this world that make you worthy of even sitting at the same panel as the gorgeous padma and very underrated gail?\n\n**take my first bite of my dry-aged bone-in medium rare rib-eye**\n\nok...you're good....you're really good...you're light a cigarette while sprawled across the trashed bed in my boxers smiling so wide my cheeks hurt GOOD!!! (and i dont even smoke!!)\n\nAfter the first bite I let out an oh so inappropriate but oh so fitting moan and every muscle in my body relaxed and I slouched down in my chair like I was 15 again and back in my friend's guest bedroom feeling like I was on top of the world. \n\nEverything was impeccable-the sides of mushrooms, asparagus, corn, potatoes, the wine, the service and decor but ALL PALED in comparison to that preposterously perfect piece of meat that I devoured unrelentingly. \n\nYou just answered all the critics who said you \""couldnt win the big one\"" by engineering a picturesque 91 yard drive in 1:34 going 11-11 passing capping it all off with a perfect pass down the seam into the heart of the Tampa 2 to your TE who falls into the end zone with 00:00 showing on the clock.\n\nYou, my friend, are a god amongst men.\n\nWait...come to think of it, the line cook who prepared my steak is a god, youre still just a pretentious douche. \n\nAnd youre bald.  hahaha...im so clever."
2;This hotel is just meh.  Nothing to write home about except for the fabulous location.  Didn't do anything more than sleep there, so I can't comment on the bistro or anything else.  A good place to stay if you can get a great rate.
1;During the 1990s, when I lived in Montreal in my late teens/early 20s, I was a frequent visitor to Super Sexe and other Montreal strip clubs. Super Sexe was always clean and classy with hot women. It was always packed at any time of day or day of the week. I was very disappointed when I stepped in there in May 2011. It looks like the owners had not put any money into renovating it for the past 10 years. There were very few patrons, and the girls looked bored. They only had a girl dancing on stage every other song. After chatting with a stripper at Super Sexe's sister club, Super Contact, I learned that the weak economy and the weak US dollar has been keeping the tourists away and as a result keeping the strip clubs empty. It is really a shame. Some of best guys nights out ever happened here. I hope it recovers as the economy improves.
0;"This place is horrible. I've been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it's not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I'm about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn't say anything.  After I said \""Hello?\"" the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?"
1;This is my fourth time staying at the hotel and I must say that the quality of service, venue up keep, and overall hotel experience is NOT what it used to be. We pay way too much money to stay here for it NOT to be up to par!!!
1;I don't know if its the time I'm going but the attitudes are unbelievable. I cannot express how rude Tasha was to me. Which is fine because frankly i didn't need it anyways. Needless to say i will not go back .
1;With Yelp as our guiding light in all things food and drink this place provides one of the most divided selections of reviews that I've seen on the site. To justify my two meagre stars:\n\nYay!\n- big range of whiskies\n- central location\n- appealing decor\n\nNope\n- service is so slow\n- seriously, haven't they picked up the message - people are WAITING!\n- I had a straight whisky, though friends had a cocktail that they failed to finish as it just wasn't very nice, which is something of a failing in a cocktail that you've paid a fair whack for\n\nSo, if you're in the city and looking for a drink - particularly an unusual or exclusive whisky - then this is just the place for you, so long as it's just about empty.
0;I've eaten here 3 times and I kick myself for going back the other 2 times. The first time it was terrible. It was fish and chips and there was nothing but heavy batter, you had a hard time finding the fish, it must have been thin as a sheet of paper. But I gave it a second chance, figuring it might have been a bad day for the cook. So this time a got adventurous and had a rib-eye steak. What a disaster, it was cooked dry, so overly done I couldn't cut it with a knife. I asked for medium-rare. So, convinced I would not ever go back, until my neighbor begged me to go with her and again, terrible food. This place I would never recommend to anyone and I made it very clear to my neighbor I would not be returning.
0;This place has gone really down hill :(  I was in last weekend after a hockey on a saturday at 9pm.  The ladies bathroom was gross.  The service was lacking in friendliness and timeliness-and all we had was beer and appetizers!  We used to love coming here, but will definitely think twice.
4;We were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and walking into the Miles Mall this was the first place we ran into. There wasn't a line as we went there on a Saturday afternoon. You can pick your sandwich and add chips and drink to your order. They give you the buzzer and you wait for your sandwich to get done.\n\nI ordered the All American sandwich, which had roasted turkey and cranbarry sauce in it. It was very tasty and everybody else liked their sandwiches too. It tasted very fresh and the bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outsite. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly and helpfull. Would definitely go back there.
3;A little overpriced for the quality. The filet mignon was not as tender as anyone in my party would have liked. Also, the truffle butter as a topping for the steak was an extra $12. It's a beautiful restaurant, great and friendly service.
4;If you are visiting Montreal you should make some time to walk this part of the Island. Beautiful little stores, cafes & the port are a few of the things to take in. Great to walk thru with your camera. The restaurants here are usually quite busy so book ahead and parking is limited so be sure to walk or take public transport! Be sure to spend a night or afternoon exploring this part of town. Old cobblestone on the streets so ladies leave your heals at home!
0;Attempted to sell a Toyota with a $8500 blue book value. The same car/make/year were being sold on the lot for $10-11K.\nThey were very nice through the whole process and appeared to be really interested in purchasing my car, which was clean and in excellent condition.\nOnly problem was they wanted to give me. $2800 for it. WTF!?!\nI understand they have to make a profit but over 3x profit on my car!?\nI politely told them to take a hike
1;You'd think it'd be pretty easy to have a successful restaurant with menu based mostly off of bacon, but Bacon Bar will prove that wrong. \n\nFor starters, the bacon jalape\u00f1os were one of the worst things I've ever eaten. No texture whatsoever. Mushy, overcooked jalape\u00f1os with soggy, limp bacon. And they added maple syrup to them as well, which wasn't listed on the menu.\n\nWe got THE bacon burger, and while it wasn't that bad, it still wasn't what we ordered. It's supposed to have bacon ground with the beef. Instead there was only bacon on top, and it was dry and overcooked. The burger also came with tomato confit on it which also wasn't listed in the menu description. So both things we ordered came with additional ingredients that weren't on the menu. \n\nOur server was really somethin too. There was nobody in the restaurant and while we were waiting for our food, she sat at the bar and ate her dinner while she was on her phone.\n\nWe won't be back.
2;No. I can NEVER avoid a new Kabob place. Not ever. Frankly, I think I would rather eat a good gyro more than any other meat related sandwich, dish, or anything. I am not Greek. I am not of any mediterranean decent, but I have the Gyro fever and there is no stopping me. \n\nSo naturally I had to stop in when I was in Fremont to get a load of the Kabob Korner and their Super Gyro of course. \n\nIt was a Gyro which is good in my book. It was super if you use the word super kind of sarcastically. Overall it was OK. Really, I am looking for that yogurt sauce and lamb/beef combo to knock my socks off but this super gyro was pretty super normal. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Especially for the area it is really convenient to have the best food in the world so close to old town Vegas. Next time I try it I will update this review- I hope my mind will change or I will find that gem that they cook like none other. For now I say it is worth it if you have the time, the budget and the tase for a Gyro that you just can't kick.
0;I think we made the mistake of coming here right before closing time, my seafood chowder was too thick and creamy with no flavor, my chicken was cold and flavorless, the sauteed mushrooms felt like they only touched the skillet for a second and my husbands chorizo omelette had about 2 pounds of chorizo in it! Gross! \n\nBad food and bad service ( I even saw a manager wearing shorts), don't come to this location.  Stay far far away!
3;This place gets it right with amazing coffee, friendly baristas, and a great atmosphere. \n\nOther places in Pittsburgh may have one of these (or maybe even two!) but, certainly not all three.\n\nA great pit stop while walking around lower Lawrenceville.
0;I went on Saturday and they obviously were only letting in White people. All shapes and sizes. Some pretty and some NOT so pretty. The only thing they all had in common was being White. Out of 7 people (3 girls/4boys) only 2 of our group was White. The only way they were letting our mixed race group in is if we paid a ridiculous amount of money. It wasnt even just purchase a bottle. It was large bar tabs for EACH guy, plus entrance fee for EACH guy AND a special $20 tip from EACH guy to enter this so called amazing club. This bar is racist. Spend your money somewhere else.
2;This location has been through a few iterations over the years, but it is now known as Shari's.  From what I read in the local paper (http://www.lvrj.com/news/40836542.html) it is a family owned and operated establishment.  Upon entering, you can confirm this, as it feels like it.  The staff was very friendly.  I went on a Sunday ~11am, and the place was jumping.  Could have been because of the recent write-up in the RJ, but they said that weekend business has been brisk for awhile now.  I had the monstrous breakfast sandwich (it has a funny name that escapes me right now), the wife had a burger, and the kids had pancakces.  All was quite good, and nothing felt fake or processed.  I am growing tired of the places that just deep fry everything.  Not this place.  \n\nI went for lunch a few days later, had their classic burger, and it too was quite good.  They have a sauce with it that is tasty, and they didn't bat an eye when I asked for gravy-fries (I think it must be an East Coast thing).  The Chicken Vegetable soup was really excellent, probably the best part of the meal.  Very fresh, seasoned just right.\n\nI reserve 5 stars for only my favorite haunts, which would leave them at 4 stars.  I took one star away, because I feel like when the bill was tallied, it felt a little pricier than it seemed going in.  Thus they get 3, which is still good in my book.  Oh, one last thing, they use great buns!  Not dry and stale like the stuff you get at some places.
0;What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concerned
3;Went to AZ for a trip and saw a movie in this theater, looks like this is a local chain. \nI would say that its pretty clean atleast when i went. The screen size is decent and chairs are comfy.
4;My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.\n\nI rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, but when I do, I always stop at KO's.  This is a nice, friendly neighborhood bar.  The owner is a nice guy, the staff is always friendly & courteous.  They have fun activities, like poker tournaments, on certain days.  They have TVs in every inch of the restaurant, so you never miss a game.  You can easily spend a couple hours here.\n\nThe menu is pretty amazing.  They have your basic bar food like potato skins, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  But, the manage to elevate their food to something surprising and unexpected.  Their chicken sandwich with pesto & cheese, so good & unexpected for a location like this.  Yet simple enough to make you wonder why other places can't manage good food like this.  I maintain their sweet potato fries are the best in the valley.  Their mac & cheese is worth the calories and cholesterol.\n\nI ordered their grilled cheese one day, without tomatoes.  When it came, they forgot & added them by mistake.  Didn't bother me, I was willing to take them off.  But the waiter took it back, had them make me fresh one, and then took it off the bill.  All without me asking.\n\nAn excellent place to watch the big game or just pop in for a quick lunch.
3;"Visited Kyara on a Saturday night. Usually I had to wait long time to get seated; however, we were seated right away this time.We ordered plum wine (choya), pork kimchi, ika butter, pork fried rice, and ramen. I have been there for more than 10 times, but the consistency of the food is absent most of the times. The noodles for the ramen tasted bad and kind of puffy. Some servers are friendly and attentive. Some need more training on customer service. I would rate Kyara better than Ichiza, but I still do think they have room for improvement in order to satisfy more customers."
0;I don't even want to give them 1 star, they deserve ( - ) stars if you ask me!!!\n\nMassage Envy is the worst company I have ever dealt with! Fist off my son bought me 3 massages from them for my Birthday. I used one of my massages on July 13, 2012 and they just called me to tell me my massages expire on August 11th because they were only good for 3 months, unless I sign up as a member! What's wrong with this? First, they were a gift and no one told me they would expire! Second, there is a law about gift certificates and gift cards not having expiration because it is the same thing as CASH, now I would think that this would fall under that same thing since it was a gift from my son. Let me find a lawyer and start a lawsuit and we will see who wins!\n\nDon't ever buy anyone you know a pacakage as a gift because they expire but, they don't tell you that!
0;Come here to drink. Don't come to eat. The service is a joke. Slow food movement has a new definition.  We got our food one plate at a time. Torture. Seriously got here at 1pm. At 230pm still waiting on food.  Train wreck.  Don't order grilled cheese because they don't use oils?  Dry warm bread with melted cheese makes a grilled cheese. Wth?  Same with the hash Browns.
3;"So, I dug this show and I'm not a Soprano's fan.  They kinda had me at \""How Ya Doin!\""  When you walk into Soprano's you walk in to a strip club, they even give you stripper dollars.  It's kinda awesome at the kick off.\n\nHowever....the show starts and they make you watch this scene to introduce you to all the characters that are being lampooned from the show.  It pulls you out of this great surrounding and then makes you watch a play....not too cool.\n\nThat being said, the actors a fun to talk to and play with.  The food was kinda awesome. So, for interactive theater, the Soprano's wasn't half bad.  Be prepared to get out of your chair alot, there's more dancing and involvement than Tony and Tina's."
3;Food was amazing. So crowded for a Sunday at two. We were just picking up goo and they forgot a taco, but quickly refunded us out money.
3;"Great place to visit while in Charlotte. I saw it on \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" so figured we'd give it a try, great choice!"
4;This restaurant by far surpassed our expectations! We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.\n\nWe tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!! \n\nFor dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.\n\nDessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.\n\nOur service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us. \n\nBy far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!
0;If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.\nThere are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to.
2;This sis way out of my 'hood, but I wanted to check out the Outlets opening weekend. Parking was not the worst, but what they had their staff directing didn't really make sense. It didn't take me too long to find a spot, though my friend I met up with parked across the way at Westgate which was easier. It was pretty crowded giving it was the day after Black Friday. Just browsing, there wasn't too much that caught my eye. I did notice, like others, that there is a severe lack of food venues, and the line for the pretzel place was out the door because of this. The prices were I did end up buying a  few things were worth it, but I can't say I'd make the drive out there unless I was desperate.
0;We ordered from this place last not and I am not happy at all. First off the lady on the phone was not pleasant, she seemed annoyed to take my order. She said it'd take 45 minutes to get my food delivered and it took an hour and a half. The food they did deliver however was not what I ordered. And it took another 20 minutes for MY food to get to my house. And two guys showed up this time in two seperate vehicles which I though was strange. I don't have a problem with that I just thought it was abnormal. They then had the nerve to ask for the other order back and then I thought that is super weird and not sanitary at all!! THEN the two guys proceeded to unpack that food and repackage it in new containers and bags I'm guessing in hopes to deliver it to the right person! EEEWWW!! They put their customers health at risk just to save food and money. NO THANK YOU! Then they left their TRASH on my wall outside my house (the empty styrofoam containers and the ripped plastic bag) because they apparently don't know how to throw anything away! When I sat down to eat my food it was ice cold and it was not very good. Needless to say I WILL NOT be ordering ANYTHING from them EVER again! I don't know what sort of place thinks they can get away with something as disgusting as that! But I hope they read this and change their ways because they're gonna make their customers very sick if they keep operating this way.
1;Bought a season pass last season and was very disappointed. Went once this season on a free day which was nice of them. The water was still super cold but lines were sorter so we actually went down a couple slides. The wave pool is very mild compared to the one at cowabunga bay. Had a better time, but still not sold.
2;It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based on its buffet only. Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \n\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\n\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\n\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\n\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\n\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review.
0;This place is a dump. Very dirty and grimy. The tables and seats are not clean. The waffles were ok. Nothing special. I would not go here again.
2;Overpriced but usually can get what you need in men's cologne, interesting they must be doing great as the manager working the opening shift, would not open the door 6 minutes early as 7 people tried to enter just before 10:00 am.
2;Good ethnic food in Phoenix, recommended by my local friend.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great lunch specials!!!\n-Koobideh was delicious, very generous portions\n-Great for a quick meal if you let them know you are in a time crunch\n-pitas were soft and fresh\n\nCons:\n\n-Location is kind of weird \n\nVerdict:\n\nWould come back here but probably only when meeting in the area.
0;Not sure what the hype is all about. Based on some of the other reviews I called  in to order the Grilled Pork Sandwich ahead of time.  I was told it would take about 20 minutes.   This  establishment looked rather filthy.  The one and only table there had not been wiped down.   Nothing to brag about.  The pork was lacking in flavor and I don't see anything special about the roll.    Sandwich was cold and sodas from the fridge were not.
1;Met a friend for lunch at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  Got there around 11:45, and we were the first there for lunch.  Ordered small spinach salad, which was very interesting w candied pecans, fresh spinach, feta, apples - very good, except the dressing tasted old. My friend ordered the gluten free pizza which was ok,nothing special, crust was chewy. Took over an hour to be served! Waiter was quite nice and kept apologizing - almost felt sorry for him.  Thought  the meal was only ok, and quite expensive.
1;We stopped for dinner want to have a steak.  The mash potatoes and salad were good, but the steak was tough and of low quality..  The price of the food didn't match the quality of the food
2;"Went here for a conference/meeting. The hotel is at the center of the Charlotte business district. The location is perfect and there are lots of interesting restaurants to visit around the hotel. \n\nThe rooms are fairly modern. Nothing fancy, but quite OK. The bathrooms are a bit outdated. The beds are quite comfortable. The noisy from the hallways is ridiculous. On a Saturday night you can hear all the parties taking place. They really need to isolate the rooms better for the noise. There is even a sheet of paper in the rooms related to \""non-disturbance policy\"". Clearly the hotel is aware that they have a problem:-)\n\nThe staff is not very attentive. They seem indifferent to everything. The door man could not be bothered to pick up my luggage, .... Just not the kind of service you expect from a Marriott."
1;Oh no, a breakfast place that doesn't know how to make an omelet?  For shame.  Oh no, a restaurant staff that doesn't care if you enjoyed your meal, even worse.  It's really too bad because the first time I went here the place was decent, it's why I decided to make a return trip, even though it's not technically in my 'hood. \n\n I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.  \n\nWhat was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.  I won't be back.
4;Like others have said, great staff here. Mary is normally at the front counter with a big smile on at lunch time. Keep people this nice working here and ill keep coming back. You can get decent fast food anywhere, but great service is another story. Great job guys!
3;The all you can eat sushi menu is pretty extensive. At $26 for dinner it is right on par with other sushi places I have been to. The sushi is fresh, the steaks and meats are tender and juicy, and the appetizers like the gyoza and seaweed salad are tasty. The calamari could use some work in the flavor department however. The service there is second to none. You are greeted when you walk in by nearly all of the staff, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive, and the bus staff makes sure your table isn't cluttered with plates and your drinks are never empty. The wait for the sushi can get a little long, so order up some appetizers and sides while you're waiting. Just remember that there are other tables waiting for sushi, and only a few sushi chefs to make all the sushi so patience is a virtue here.
4;"A trendy, upscale\""ish\"" restaurant on the east side? Finally! Loved the food, loved the decor. Now just needs some a clientele under 60 ;')"
4;The best pizza I have had in a long time. Got the carnivore and a salad. I'm from the east coast and the pizza reminded me of the pizza back home, except better! The owner thanked us for coming when we left. I thought that was a nice touch. They are going to need a bigger building soon.
1;The first time I experienced this buffet was in 2009... and probably then I would have given it 3-4 stars.. but now.. something happened.. and it's not as yummy..\n\nI felt like the quality of the place has kind of gone downhill from my previous experience.\n\nThe foods were typical buffet foods.. the desserts were typical buffet desserts... nothing that really makes it stand out.. nothing that really tastes great enough for me to keep coming back..\n\nAt least it was clean..
1;Pretty confusing AIrport.   I still like SFO the most.
2;Just driving by Camelback with an empty stomach... Mexican's food sure why not??? Padre's...we sat in the patio area... our server was nice... we order the ceviche right away, it was really tasty... after that we had the calamari which were under cook and the fish taco which were not bad but it needed more sauce or maybe a more flavorful sauce, it was a lillte dry :( ....  drinks were good...Happy hour menu looks nice, we might be back...
3;"Fettuccine al Granchio, Astice e Gamberi: Homemade fettuccine with crab, lobster, and shrimp with a touch of tomato sauce, $38\n-Wow, this was excellent. Fresh seafood, fresh tasty sauce, fresh pasta. Pricey, but absolutely delicious.\n\nTiramisu, $12\n-They serve a small portion in this cone-shaped glass and it was some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Perfectly soaked lady fingers, not too sweet, light and airy mascarpone and Zabaglione. Would have liked more tiramisu, but the quality is excellent!\n-My mom got the Chocolate Mousse and that was excellent as well.\n\nDecor is very nice and overlooks the Venetian \""canal.\"" Romantic setting, with fiddlers playing in the background. You can ask them to play any tune you want (for a tip, of course); they even know the Chinese butterfly concerto! Prices are steep, but what do you expect from Vegas? Quality is excellent."
1;$27 for dinner. About 8pm last saturday night there was about an hour wait.\nThe place was crowded, so much so that it seemed a little dirty, like they couldn't tidy up fast enough. \n \nThe bad:\nThe ginger ale tasted extremely watered down.\n\nThe stone crab claws were already cracked somewhat, but I tried a few different ones and was unsuccessful at getting anything OUT of them and also managed to slice my finger open trying. Friend got some of the snow crab legs, but they just looked soggy and aged to me.\n\nI was excited to see the brie and bacon mac and cheese, but was promptly disappointed by the quality.\n\nThe decent: \nThe lamb was good and not gamey. Crepe station was pretty neat- long wait, and not Spectacular, but worth it.\n\n\nOverall, I don't remember a darn thing about this food. So very unremarkable.\n\nand the good: \nthe reason this place gets 2 stars is the Creme Brulee!!! I lucked out and snagged some, but a friend went to get dessert and came back without, saying the chef was caramelizing the tops and they weren't out yet. I went back to try the remaining desserts and she asked me to pick her up a creme brulee, but they were out again by that time.\n\n\nCaesar's buffet is the same price and I'd recommend that. We had been there 3 weeks prior, about the same time (8pm Saturday night) and there was no wait.
2;"I walked into this place thinking: \""Oh man, you know the Americans(white dudes) are going to love this place\""  Flat screen tv's, nice tables, friendly service, trendy ambience, waiters who speak good English, white guy playing sitar at the front....this is white guys paradise...unfortunately the food itself was just above average. FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \""Americans\"" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \""The spiciness wasn't there\"" review\n\nIn terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\""Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\"" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.\n\nAnd to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj"
4;My experience going here has always been excellent. The people are nice. I've never had any issues and the staff members are genuinely interested in my welfare as a client. I've only had one instance where they needed to reschedule my appointment, but they squeezed me in within a week. I don't have any complaints about the people or service here and I've been going to this location for over a year.
0;Every time I go here something gets stolen.  First it was my friends purse, then the next time it was my friends jacket.   Last night it was my jacket along with my other friends jacket.   I have no idea what is going on here but everyone agrees this place is shady and at this point it seems too coincidental. Beware and good luck.
3;"I've been here four times and I'm digging it!  It's so far up north that it's a nice break from the 'watch-your-rear\"" Westgate thug-a-dub-dub-gangstafied crew.  If I were a gangbanger here I'd be throwing it up for the NORTHSIDE (carefree highway, baby).\n\nNever had a real meal here but I've had plenty finger food and a few troughs of alcohol!  Finally a bar that has darts, pool tables, and yes, occassionally beer pong.  \n\nI do have to disagree with Chris T's POV on the women in the Scottish skirts....c'mon dude it's women in skirts, bro!  Heck, I'd take a semi-hot girl serving me beerski's over a dude any day!\n\nThe outdoor seating is fun, nice televisions outside and usually a good crowd.  \n\nIt's a good mix of people.  It's a biker-friendly bar but you will find all types here and everyone seems to get along.  The only thing I don't care for is the setup of the mens bathroom.  It's set up so that when the door opens, anyone looking can see the mirror, which looks right at whoever's throwing a whiz.  \n\nIf you're up this far north, it's definatley worth getting your drink on."
3;"I had heard of ADC but had never heard him ;) so I listened to a short youtube clip and new this was not a comedian to take my mom to, so I invited a friend. The first opening act was funny and I enjoyed him. The second female opening act was pretty crude. Then ADC came out wearing shades chain smoking and tore up the 21st century modern women and their sexuality. I don't blame him one bit for leaving those shades on and using the smoke as a shield of protection while he truthfully spat out his horrors of ho's. Comedians are like court jesters informing the king that he's naked.. what a great job to get paid for! Beware paying $9 for a can of corona and $11 for a glass of house wine :/"
1;My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing.
0;Wish I could have Yelp this place before taking my fiance here for a quick dinner. Lured by the giant golden fish tank, I was hopping this place will at least have a decent modern Chinese cuisine that equally match with its contemporary design. WRONG WRONG WRONG, The food is TASTELESS, OVERPRICED even though the service is the only one thing that is acceptable. I had the most Yucky Singapore style noodles and wonton soup in my life. SERIOUSLY, how could you go wrong with wonton noodles? This place seriously needs A NEW CHEF!
4;I was staying at the MGM and was looking for a place to eat for lunch and decided on Tap. I had the most amazing salad that was new for the summer. It had arugula, (what I think were) grape tomatoes, peppers, (get this...) watermelon, topped with feta and a vinaigrette. I would never have thought to combine watermelon and arugula but it was delicious and refreshing! Talk about a salad I'll never forget! I also had the chicken tenders after, which were also very savory and tasty. The customer service through out the restaurant was excellent. I was greeted at the front with a smile and my bartender was very attentive to my needs. I shouldn't fail to mention that Tap boasts flat-screen TVs that enclose the restaurant with sports feeds from all over the world. As a sports fan and someone who loves to eat, this place was pretty much perfect for me. But I have to say... That salad was pretty much the deal-sealer for me to have to post about it on Yelp.
3;I love, love, love the pizza here. They have great beer selections too. They have traditional flavors and new variations. They had one that was a variety of olives on top - wow - it was great. Only draw back is it's usually pretty noise and hard to have any real conversation over dinner.
2;Like most women, I'm a fan of Target. If the store brand were a band that went on tour, I'd be right up with the rest of them, throwing my panties on stage.\n\nBut this location is a little odd. It's right across from Koreatown and when we went around 4PM there were literally seventeen cars in the parking lot. So if you want to avoid a crowd, this might be the one to go to.\n\nHowever, what is missing in customers is also missing in staff and selection. Store layout is a little odd, and the first thing you see when you walk in is the little food court area- which zero people went to while we were there. The store also lacks a produce department- they would probably increase their customers if they replaced the snack stand with a fresh produce area. But that's my completely unprofessional opinion.\n\nUsually I can spend my weight in cash on the women's fashion department, but here nothing was styled or really on display and nothing caught my eye- a rarity for Target stores.\n\nFound the basic items we needed, at prices we expect for this chain, but was just underwhelmed. Other reviews say this location feels vaguely dirty, and I see what they mean but I can't put my finger on why- it's not physically dirty, but the lighting seems a little dim and the store itself just isn't as cheerful as other locations.\n\nService was okay- we were stuck in line behind a couple who racked up a $200+ bill but couldn't seem to figure out which combination of credit cards and cash would cover their purchases. Cashier graciously offered to have us check out ahead of them while previous customers got their payment together, but we declined. Throughout our visit, saw staff cleaning and reorganizing, and when we couldn't find specific items they were quick to tell us where to find them.
2;"My visit was very disappointing. The wait wasn't long for a table. All of us got AYCE so we planned on sharing everything we ordered. Everything I ordered the first round our server wrote down on paper. The edamame took over 20 minutes to come out. That was already disappointing. All the rolls came out a little after that. The 2 orders of Dynamite, grilled shrimp skewers & cucumber salad which is usually pre made was never sent out. I had to ask about the dynamite 3 times. I ordered a second round of sushi. Maybe 5 rolls. One of them was a baked roll & the server said it would take longer cause it's baked. Funny cause that's the roll that came out first! All the rolls came out & I still didn't get my Dynamite. When it did come out I started laughing cause the serving was the size of my palm! It wasn't even worth waiting for. The restaurant is nice inside. Small thought, but nice. The service was just terrible. My boyfriend has been here before & said the service was way better last two times I came here. Maybe it was just out server. She was the only one not in uniform. Just wearing a white shirt. \n\nThe buffet is priced at $24.95 per person not including drinks.\n\nThere is nothing special at all about their sushi rolls. If you look at the specialty menu they all say \""in:California roll\"" or \""in:shrimp tempura\"" with just different stuff on the outside. \n\nI will not be coming back here!"
3;"Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?  Most people, but not me.  I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.  And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital \""s\"", \""u\"", \""c\"", \""k\"", \""s\"".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner."
2;Came here based off the reviews. Sapphires reviews were bad so we passed. The girls here are pretty good lookin just a few here n there that made me ask how did they even get the job. Seats everywhere and the I like how there is a center stage and a main stage.\n\nThe bad I came in there with no cash so the ATM was my first stop. Bouncer told me the charge was like 2.50 mmm no how about they charge $10 or 9% for every transaction which ever is greater.. I'm not really caring at this point until it hit me I'm going to be charged 10 for 20 dollars ughh PLEASE bring cash the ATM will kill your pockets as well. Women's bathroom ..,. Well u share it with the strippers and a Mexican service lady and the room is soo small you would think 5 strippers wouldn't hang in there taking selfies. The dancing overall was basic only a couple would do pole tricks smh and drinks are soso. \n\nIf u find a man on the street make sure u tell him u want ladies in free or u are not going
2;I first heard about this place when I saw Hubert Keller on PBS. Was in Vegas and decided to seek the BB out. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was not terribly impressed. My wife's salmon burger was very good but the Angus burger lacked sufficient seasoning. The french fry dipping sauce arrangement was the star of the show (very good). Our son's burger plate was adequate (definately salmonella free).
3;Great sports bar, tons of TVs with all sorts of sports.  Food is pretty good for a bar.  I ordered a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was prepared very well, it was not over cooked as most non-seafood specific places tend to do.  Server, Meghan, was very nice & kept my drink full.  Free wi-fi is always a plus.
2;This was my first visit to this theater.  It was located in the Palms Casino off W Flamingo Rd in Las Vegas.  The stadium seating was nice and the reclining seats were comfortable.  The $8 matinee was until 6pm.  My senior friends (over age 50) paid $4 today and a got a small popcorn and drink for $3.  And they have $5 tickets on Mondays.\nWe will be back.
2;Pretty decent pho place. Been here a couple times. Che ba mau (rainbow dessert) is crazy good, I asked the waitress and apparently it's homemade or they make it themselves so it's fresher. They put peanuts on the top and it makes it even more delicious. Any pho dishes are good, I usually order the pho tai, i like my raw meat! Service could be better, some of the waitresses don't look too happy to be there but the food makes up for the mediocre service
0;My family & I go out to eat every  Friday,Saturday, & Sunday. I don't think we have ever had such horrible service. We sat at the table for 10 minutes not one person took our drinks or even greeted us. All the employees just looked at our table nobody ever came. When we finally got up to leave some of the employees said bye thank you. \nWorst service ever.
1;Salads, soups, sandwiches, and cookies with a nice assembly-line-type set-up.  You do get a cookie with each meal, it's large and it's clean.  They have breakfast in the morning.\n\nThis just isn't my favorite place to eat - nothing is terrible, but the ingredients are pretty blah and the resulting meals are, as well.  On top of all that, they're not at all inexpensive for what you get, and the service is as bland as the food.  \n\nI only eat here when there are no other options.
2;First, if adorable toenails are important to you this is the place to go.  They have TONS of designs to choose from (I don't just mean a flower on the toe) you can have plaid, polka dots, seasonal designs, everything!  I always get lots of compliments on my toes and I have never gotten the same design twice.\nThe salon itself is nothing fancy.  I guess it's what to be expected from a nail place by Home Depot.  Also, don't bother calling ahead for an appointment -- I swear they don't write them down and just take people as they come in the door.  \nPrices are reasonable.  Heads up, you can pay with debit/credit but the want cash tips and always roll their eyes if you try to tip on the card.
2;I finally got a chance to try out Maki Taco at the Food Truck Rally in Noda.  I met up with a few friends to find out what the big deal was about these food trucks.  I ordered the Spicy Crab Tacos w/ avocado and the Shrimp Hibachi. The food was delicious but I wanted more for the price I paid.  Call me cheap but 2 tacos for $8.50 was kinda pricey to me.  I ordered the Shrimp Hibachi for my daughter and it was $9.50.  It was definitely a kids meal size but a grown up price.  The shrimp were small but overall it was delicious.  I was still hungry after devouring my tacos. LOL.  The wait wasn't long and the service was friendly.  I would consider coming back and trying other things on their menu.
4;Great and knowledgeable staff that are ALWAYS willing to help or just sit and chat for a bit. Amazing selection of everything from bags to guides and if they don't have it they will order it and get it to you ASAP. They have great prices and give discounts if you buy in bulk or military which is always nice to be appreciated! The number one thing that I love about DRS is that they open earlier than any other store and have EVERYTHING you would ever need or want!!!
4;This place is BOMB. For $5, I got the best burger I have ever had, some delicious and perfectly seasoned fries, and a drink. How do you beat that? And the guy behind the counter (Brandon) is really energetic and nice. You need anything, just let him know and he takes care of you. The first time my friend and I went in there, he asked if we had been before, we answered no, and he gave us the whole meal for $3 and thanked us for coming in. I was already sold and I hadn't even tasted the food.\n\nThe place is also real quaint - total hole in the wall/dive with a really cool patio out in the back. There is literally no reason for anyone in the Phoenix area to have not tried this place and had it completely change their life.\n\nThat's about it.
2;It's the typical Harkins.  Yeah, I have a stack full of cups back home that I always forget to bring.  : )\n\nThey really need a better selection at the snack bar of some foods that are not high fat and high sodium.  And snack bar prices for what they do have are insultingly high.  They are pretty proud of their food.
3;I LOVE TACOS! Safe to say i could probably have tacos just about every day and be a very happy woman! It was hot as hell for being mid October but still was able to enjoy myself. Two bucks a taco and we all had a decent amount. Good karma happened to follow us that day, a guy was leaving and handed us about 20 xtra tickets that he was not going to use. SCORE! So we were able to grub and drink even more than we intended. Overall I think that event was a success. I didn't have any trouble getting drinks as other people mentioned, maybe it was the time of day I showed up and it was less busy.
4;If only there was one of these off the strip! The dough was cooked to absolute perfection and i was impressed with the amount of in house ingredients and locally sourced dairy and produce. Even being on the strip you'll be hard pressed to find dining this good at these prices. While specialty pies top out at $15 you can still go for a Margherita at a shade under $8. Also while the beer list is not long or cheap they feature two taps from Goose Island in addition to fairly standard offerings. I found the staff to be pleasant as well. All of that combined with the proximity to other good eateries equals five stars for me.
0;Found their rental ad on a zillow or trulia and received a call back from Keenan Gerson and set-up an appointment to see a house later that day.  We arrived on-time but Mr. Gerson was 15 minutes late.  Looked at the house and liked it but was very vague on answers.  He told us to just apply online.  So, I tried to do that but was not able to complete the application process after many failed attempts.  The next day I called their office and a lady answered and said that Mr. Gerson was in, then she came back on the line and told me he was not and wanted me to leave a message.  I did leave a message and never received a call back since.  Good thing because I found an awesome property elsewhere with great people showing the house.  \nAlso, its about $35-$40 application fee for each person going to live at the house, non-refundable.  Just a heads up to all who are out there looking to use their services.
4;Stayed at the South Point for the first time and wanted sushi type of food, so my family decided to try it out since it's inside the hotel and the first time we ate here I knew I would come back. Sushi is just so good. Try to catch them on a happy hour time though cause they have a good selection for great prices.
2;This place is really a busy location.  I walked in for an MRI expecting a similar experience to West Valley Imaging.  I was way off.  This was so much more crowded.  I started in one waiting area where I signed in and waited to be called up for paper work.  When I was called up I was moved to a second waiting room where I completed my paper work and waited to be called up again.  I was called up after a few minutes and processed in their computer system.  I sat back down and waited until I was called into yet another waiting room.  Waiting room #3.  I sat there for several minutes before I was brought a clip board with more paper work and two hospital gowns to change into.  I changed and completed my paperwork and watched several other people get called in before me.  I'm pretty sure some of them got there after me but I can look past that.  I did take some valium to get me through the scan so maybe they were waiting for it to take affect.  When I finally got called back to the MRI I climbed up on the table, put my head in a cage that made me feel not unlike Hannibal Lecter, and was slowly inserted into the tube.  It only lasted 15 minutes.  I was expecting to be in there a lot longer. I didn't even need the valium with how short a time I was in.  Whatever.  At least I made it through.  Steinberg may have a machine that I consider superior to the one West Valley but they herd you like cattle from one room to the next.  Its a little ridiculous.
4;Always great for a variety of wholesome foods and desserts! Everything is neatly organized.
2;"Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Vegas so far, which isn't saying much, since I've only had buffets). We had tickets for a show at 8pm, and ended up bumping up our reservation last minute to 530pm (when the restaurant opens) without a hitch.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely very trendy -- black lacquer countertops, red roses, clear hurricanes of colorful peppers, fruit & red roses around an open kitchen -- and despite the business casual recommendation, there were many people in jeans and tshirts as well. \n\nAtmosphere/ service: The countertop seating gives you the best view of the kitchen, and feels like a sushi bar. The waiters are definitely attentive, probably bc they can't escape you looking at them when your'e done eating.\n\nFOOD\nMenu: There's a tasting menu, a smaller 5 course menu, tapas (about $20/ plate, NOT recommended), and traditional appetizers + main course menu. And also a theatre menu (L'Unique) with 3 courses all on one plate for $39, served in 15 min. We ordered the club menu, plus a tapas, appetizer, and dessert a la carte-- more than enough for 2 people. We enjoyed a half bottle of sparkling rose ($50, light and fruity but not recommended-- gave us headaches afterwards). \n\nOverall, the portions weren't huge but it was definitely very rich-- either with butter, cream, or heavily doused in olive oil. Such is French cooking, eh? (Actually, it was more Californian style than French, with the exception of a heavy hand in cream, butter, and olive oil in every dish.)\n\nBreaking it down: (updated from website; it's not posted there yet)\n1. Amuse bouche: foie gras, port wine reduction, and parmesan foam parfait. Salty, foamy, and well balanced, savorly bite to start the evening. Best dish of the evening.\n2. Mussels in a chowder: very creamy, also very savory and o\n3. Langosteen dumping with arugula/ spring salad - tasted like shrimp tempura, but the lobster was very tender; the salad was a pass\n4. Pounded veal - just OK\n5. Trio of goat, cow's,  and cow's cheeses (in order of robust to mild) served with walnut-raisin bread (best to eat on its own, or with a mild cheese), egg-walnut bread, and country bread (best with goat cheese). Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. \n6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)\n7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.\n8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!\n9. Sorbets and ice creams - refreshing ending. 5 scoops of mandarin orange sorbet (favorite), vanilla bean, coffee (both mediocre), raspberry sorbet (light), and pistachio ice cream (second favorite) topped with sugar crisp and 2 pieces of thin chocolate.\n\nOther information:\n- Our waiter informed us all the food was shipped directly from France, including the cheese. \n- Joel Robuchon makes his own bread (complimentary, bottomless bread basket with mini baguettes, country bread rolls, and buttery plain crossaints) bc \""he couldn't find a good bakery in Vegas.\""\n- Still water costs $8 (Evian).\n- Reservations recommended, need to confirm 72 hrs in advance to secure\n- NOT for vegetarians or vegans - every dish has seafood or meat except the bread. \n- If you're allergic to shellfish, tell the restaurant in advance and they have some menu alternatives.\n\nOverall, 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5). Quite expensive ($260 including tax/ tip for the two of us) but worth the money every so often."
0;"I usually like to give compliments to show a hard working person or company some love, but after my experience at this wild house, I had to confirm the negative reviews. After straightening out my messed up reservation, I proceeded to my room that I was told overlooked the pool, and after taking a look out the window, my \""pool\"" view overlooked the parking garage. \nThe advertised flat screen was on old television, the hot water was down the first night, no fridge or coffee makers and water cost $3-5. Just go outside the hotel get your water for way cheaper. \nEverything reeks of smoke; the hallways, the elevators, every corner of the casino! I got aa free and unwanted audio session of the couple next to me have a morning quicky at 8:45 a.m. (moans , groans, skin slapping, etc) and had to crank up ESPN loud in order to get rid of the noise. No shuttles, so if you aren't driving , prepare to spend or bring your running shoes.\nThe people selling stuff on your way to the room get annoying quick and you can tell this hotel only cares about bottom dollar. The employees at the deli and Rock & Ritas are pretty cool but overall the Place is a dump!\nStay away from this place!"
2;I thought the steak needed more flavor.   It was too greasy, and not in the good way.  Fries okay.  Onion rings clearly not fresh.   It's a great idea with not so good on execution.  OK, not great.   It seems like there is potential, but needs help.
0;Holy Crap this place is heinous.  Its really hard to find from the miracle miles shops, its hidden at the end of a long hallway.  I didn't order food so I can't comment on that but I can say that based on the cleanliness of the bar in general I wouldn't want to.  Literally and I mean literally every surface of this establishment is sticky and I was there at 12 pm so its not like people had been there all day making a mess of the place.  Half the lights in the womens bathroom were either not on or burned out, there was dried blood droplets on the floor, and there was a small bag with sketchy looking pills in my stall.  WTF is anyone in charge of cleaning this place??  I had a bloody mary that tasted like V8 and a shot of vodka- no olive, no spice, no garlic, no celery I could have made a better drink at home.  They have Sierra Nevada for 12$ a pitcher which in my opinion is the best deal but if you can AVOID DB'S PONG AND POOL
4;Spak Brothers is the best pizza shop in the city. The wing sauces are incredible! Great people own the place and it's very easy to support.
4;Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. They have exceptional sangria, great service and staff, and the outdoor misters always wonderful as well.
3;Carol has done my makeup for me for special events.  She says she gives me the California girl look.  In any case, I always dazzle after Carol works her magic.  I highly recommend her for make up, make overs, and facials.\n\nCandy Stone\nStone Talent
0;"When we asked the manager, Alan, how much he would pay for the tattoos my niece received the night prior and his response is \""nothing\"" that is a clear indication of the quality of this tattoo shop. There is a big sign on the door indicating no one under 18 is allowed without ID, but no worries they won't ask for one anyway.  She and her friend (barely over 18)  were able to get tattoos by simply signing a consent form, and did *not* show their ID.  Mike did the tattoo and left her with dry blood and ink; I expect tattoos to bleed, but don't expect dry blood (that may have rubbed off his glove) 3 inches from the tattooed area.  It looked completely unsanitary and she left with no after care at all.  The tattoos were very simple in design, yet the quality is extremely poor with an outrageous cost -- as indicated by the manager's comment.  Yes, Alan did offer to fix the tattoos after they healed, but would you go back to this place?  Absolutely not."
3;Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list.
0;So nice of them to close while they are currently offering a deal on Living Social. Don't forget to request a refund if you recently purchased yours!
1;Extremely busy for 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Had to wait for a table to be cleaned.  You can tell they do alot of business. .. but the interior needs a good scrubbing.  The bathrooms are filthy,  the high chairs are black with grease..i can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The food was good. .. you hey what you pay for.
4;Isaac was prompt, efficient, and most important , his job knowledge.  He took care of our two leaky faucets quickly, and thoroughly explained the work he did.  An invoice was provided along with a parts and labor guarantee.  This is a family run business,\nand I highly recommend that you call them with any plumbing problems.
1;"My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps \""offset\"" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.  I know not to expect too much from places that are meant to squeeze tourists, but there are many, many better places to go on the Vegas strip that give you much more value when they charge these high prices."
1;Located in the newest Vegas hotspot The Cosmopolitan Hotel, Wicked Spoon was more like Weak Spoon as my expectations for the establishment fizzled at my first spoonful. \n\nOffense number 1: There were no crab legs. Really? Why are there no crab legs? If Paris can do crab legs, why can't the Cosmopolitan do crab legs? In all seriousness, they have crazy (ugly) $500/night rooms and ridiculous $20-60 cover at Marquee, minimum $25/bet tables and you can't even foot the bill for my crab legs. The hell? \n\nOffense number 2: Bland food. From the eggs benedict to the deserts everything was bland city. \n\nWhile the food lacks taste, it definitely makes up in presentation. All of the food is nicely presented - from the glass case full of french styled mini deserts to the individual take out boxes and egg benedict pans - it definitely brings self-serve buffet and hour d'erves to a whole new level. Sadly the food is not nearly as good as it looks and I felt like eating the bag of chips in my purse more than the food that sat in front of me. And although the presentation was nice I found getting the food back to my table to be a pain-staking process as my plate was not big enough to house no more than two or three of these mini pots/pans/boxes. I don't know about y'all, but if I'm grubbing at the buffet, I am grubbing. Period. \n\nI will never return and encourage all my friends not to experience Wicked Spoon. It's not worth it. Save your money, do yourself a favor and eat at the Wynn Buffet or Paris. They're much better.
1;They food is really good but usually takes about 15-20 minutes for them to make a sandwich.
4;Mexican Benedict zomg!
0;Never again.  When we first got there we saw dried light poop water splatters all over the toilet... inside and out.  We also saw menstrual blood on the seat and front of the bowl.  Called house keeping to clean and they a one-swipe shitty job.  The disgusting leftovers from the previous users were still there.\nSave your money and go somewhere else.  I've been to quality inns way cleaner than the MGM.  Ewww.....  totally unacceptable.
0;"Had to file a complaint with corporate office. Enough is enough with the horrible customer service.  I have four dogs therefore I probably go once a week to get food for them.  Every single time I stop in there is no greeting, no \""how can I help you\""....and when you do ask for help it seems like it bothers them.  If you don't like working for Petco please do not take it out on the customers. I really hope corporate talks to them and brings it to their attention because I will not be coming back.  I am going to go out of my way to find a local family owned pet store that actually still values the relationship with their customers."
0;You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity. \n\nSo I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm.\n\nBrought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry. Went to Jack in the Box. Got an order of tacos and stuffed jalape\u00f1os. Called it a night. \n\nWould I go back?...No.
3;I'll be honest:  I avoided this place for years because the name is just ridiculous.  It's hard to say.  It makes me sound lispy, and I just don't like it.  Now, my fairer half--who finds herself quite often having to talk sense into me when I'm too analytical and ridiculous (in this case, concerning a restaurant name)--is from New Orleans and explained to me the story of Chris' Steakhouse, and of Ruth's subsequent purchase of Chris' name, and thus the lispy-sounding restaurant that would become Ruth's Chris.  She also forced (or strongly encouraged) me to eat at Ruth's Chris to cure me of my aversion to eating here.  \n\nI really don't crave steak often, but I enjoy eating one here when I do.  The asparagus is pretty damn tasty, and the stuffed mushroom caps are to die for.  And you could actually die if you eat too many of them.  My main reason for visiting Ruth's is to drink scotch with my lady (who, because she is awesome, also drinks scotch) and while away the afternoon, chatting with the friendly bartenders and gazing at each other through hazy, bloodshot eyes.  Mushroom caps and Macallan 18 are the way to a woman's heart, my friends.  Yes indeed.
0;"Seriously worst waxing experience ever. I usually get my eye brows done when I get my nails done.. nothing to fancy its cheap and they do a pretty good damn job. So when my mom told me about the European wax center I was a bit hesitant, I'm comfortable at my nail salon however the first time you go it is free and my mom got 5 buck in her account for referring me so why not? Anyway so I mean its clearly says that this facility is a waxing center, they don't offer any other services you would think that the staff would be pro's however I'm unsure if the red headed girl I had was new which I don't think she was because as soon as I was done she happily greeted another customer by name before the receptionist gave her the form.  So I go into one of the waxing rooms she tells my about the wax how this place is the only one in the world that uses it (well maybe there is a reason) It did not work very well or maybe it does and she just didn't so a sufficient job. So she waxed me trimmed my eyes brows  then gave me a mirror to check it out.. I asked if she was gonna trim my eyebrows and the little snob says very rudely \""I already did\"" when I'm looking directly in the mirror and I can see that my eyebrows hardly even looked cleaned up. I had to have her re do them 3 times and by the third I was fed up and just left went home and finished the damn thing myself. I was not satisfied at all the only good experience about this place was the girl at the front desk. Not to mention the apparently they have a 9 minute no show rule my appointment was at 4:15pm she was not ready until 4:28pm, I will not recommend this place to anyone I had an awful experience and I will not return. Very disappointed considering this place specialize's in waxing."
0;Not recommended at all.\nWorst place to go for Eye Exam.\nIt took us about same time as going to Emergency room in the hospital.\nNo point of taking appointment,they make you wait for hours.
1;We went there twice last week and had 2 different experiences as a hotel guest in the Carefree resort.  Monday night dinner. Fine, better than fine. Good service, good food and it was quiet, not many patrons so we were well taken care of.....no complaints.\n\nThursday morning breakfast. Terrible. \nThey were expecting a large group to come in but we were ahead of the group by 5 minutes and the first guests in. No-one brought us any water (until after we finished breakfast) despite being the only people in the restaurant for 5 whole minutes.\n\nThe menu was cancelled and we had a buffet due to the large group I presume. This would be okay but the buffet was really poor. It felt like the food was made hours ago and reheated. Fruit wasn't particularly fresh.\nThe tip was included on the check. We cant figure out for what as we received no water, we got our own food and yet they included a service charge of TWENTY PERCENT, not 15, but 20. That took some cheek.  We didnt contest it , too much effort. We'd rather just report it here and hope someone reads it and decides against going. That was a truly awful breakfast.\n\nI tend to leave very positive reviews when I make the effort to actually do this but this was a really big letdown. I couldn't recommend this place to anyone.
1;"A lot of older hotels on the strip have had renovations in attempt to keep up with newer chic hotels such as Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Tropicana made an effort, but fell short. \n\nService is unreasonably slow, both in receiving service and trying to reach it. A little over forty five minutes for room service to arrive with food. We had ordered appetizers and a rare burger. The food was on the colder end toward lukewarm. Had asked for towels and had them arrive after forty five minutes and a \""reminder call\"". Same sort of service at their Beach Club restaurant. The people are wonderfully nice though. \n\nI wouldn't return. Not for the service, or the tub that doesn't plug, or the shower head that doesn't stay, or the long walk to the room from any entrance.\u00a0It's just not worth the money. The room was okay at best.\n\nLots of older people as well, not that it was an issue, just a heads up."
0;When I came to Vegas this place got so much talk but really these were the worst tacos I've ever had in my life the meat was so gross I couldn't even eat them! Not to mention the horrible service! definitely NEVER coming back!!!
3;This is a great old steakhouse.  The steak was delicious.  Perhaps we went on an off night because they ran out of porterhouse and the steak came out cold.  The steak was really delicious and the service and atmosphere were great so I'm really going to chalk it up to an unlucky night because all the sides were delicious and I really can't complain about anything else.  I would definitely give this place another chance because if you can love it even after eating cold steak, it must be good.
4;A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\n\nI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good.
2;First time in..I'm told they opened last Friday.. doing the research now.. more to come. ...\n\nFollow up :) \n\nSo a friend and I had some drinks, we ate some food.. having not been open long, they were already out of 'signature' items like the pretzels.. so we opted for the potato chip nachos, cheese-steak, and French dip. Nothing bad, nothing great about any one of them. \n\nNachos were good, a little light on the toppings, but tasty. The French dip and the cheese steak were both good and came with fries or cole slaw.\n\nThe service was good, and friendly, and that alone would make me go back. \n\nOtherwise, it's loaded with tv's beer, grub, and drinks.. should do well on the linq. \n\nHappy Eating!
3;One of my new favourite shawarma places (and places I get most excited for when visiting Montreal).  The shawarma meat is very well seasoned and tender.  They get it absolutely spot on.  The sides are quite good too.  We came here once with a large group and the owner came out and greeted us and gave us complimentary dates, which was very nice.\nDon't know if it was an accident, but the last time I went, there was very little meat on my plate, which was a disappointment.
3;"Leider musste der Starbucks oben auf dem Tower weichen. Evtl. zu Gunsten eines weiteren \""Fahrgesch\u00e4ftes\"".\n\n\n Der Starbucks auf dem Casino-Level existiert aber noch.\nEin Starbucks wie jeder andere in den Staaten. Hier jedoch erschien mir das Personal etwas pfiffiger als in vielen anderen Starbucksfilialen. Und leider kann man bei der Kaffeezubereitung doch Fehler begehen. Diesbez\u00fcglich durfte ich erhebliche Qualit\u00e4tsunterschiede in den USA feststellen.\nBei meinem heutigen Besuch gab es an der Kaffeezubereitung in diesem Store nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln."
3;Great day spa with great massages.  Highly recommended.  Try the double massage, fantastic.
2;Food is nothing to brag about, in fact it is over priced. I have been in there a couple of times and always feel like we are a bother to the staff, as if we don't belong.
2;Food was fantastic! It was SO loud I felt like i was screaming during dinner...didn't completely ruin it but I am undecided if I would go back. Keeping in mind, it was 7:30pm, not 10:00pm. A bit disappointing.
2;18 dollars for 4 meatballs is not a great deal! The food is ok. But I think this place is over priced. Ambience is not that great either.
0;This place is disgusting. I think I may have had the worse restaurant food in my life today.
0;"The establishment opens at 5:00 PM, I get there at 5:20ish and the lady at the booth says \""We are closed for a private event\"" and then asked me to come back at 7:00 PM. Honestly, no point in rating this any higher as they didn't bother reserving open seats for general people. \n\nThey didn't even bother changing the giant sign on their podium that said \""Opens at 5:00 PM\"""
3;Come for the happy hour! This place has got to be the BEST place to bring a first date.
3;Got in for free while registered for the posing audition, so no complain.\nI posed today!\n\nPS: Get a brazilian wax if you plan to pose nude. See my list where I get it done in Northern California.
1;Good effort, but a fail in my mind.  It is definitely WAY too loud in there... if I can't have a conversation while yelling... not a spot for me.  Tried the dumplings, burgers and coconuts... and found the price to be fairly high for mediocre 'street' food.  I think the only thing I would be back for is to pick-up some Beard Papas cream puffs.
0;Well, after reading all the great reviews and hearing a lot about this place, I was so excited to eat here for lunch yesterday! I got chili cheese fries, and a plain ole' hotdog. My daughter got an order of the chicken nuggets. I wasn't really impressed by any of the food I had ordered. I'm really picky about my hotdogs and I was kind of grossed out by how thick they were. I'm used to the dodger dog styled ones, not Chicago style. That turned me off for the rest of my meal. My bun was really soggy and my hot dog kept falling out of it and that just pissed me off. The chili fries were also really runny. Not sure if they make their own chili but it was defiantly too runny for my liking. And last but not least, my daughters chicken nuggets tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped all over them. And don't get me wrong, I put salt on everything, I LOVE salt, but even that amount of salt was too much for me! I just really wasn't impressed by this place. Ill be sticking to wienershnitzle
4;This place is not only inspiration for custom baby photo books, but the ultra sound room is soothing and lovely! Spacious room with large flat screen for viewing. Terry the owner does an amazing job at the sneak peeks. Pictures are instant as well as online uploads, makes for simple sharing with family and friends.
3;I came here for a friends benefit for his son.  No more details need to be explained but it was for a great cause.  This place opened its doors, offered its people and singers/bands performed.  For the cause, I am glad I came and saw this place.  I have never been to the arts district for a nighttime experience/bars!  \n\nIt was hard to find because the link to the yelp map does take you to the wrong location.  Once getting to the right location it is pretty much on the down low the lighting in the sign only light half of the sign and there are no signs around the door.  Little shady looking, but after walking in wow.  Nicely decorated in hip decor lighting is awesome for the nighttime experience and the staff is nice.  \n\nPrices are middle ground and the acoustics are good even though we were sitting on the other side of the bar from the bands.\n\nDefinitely a do over!
2;"Meh.  Aside from people crowding around your car to \""hand wash\"" it, it's a pretty average car wash. \n\nThey'll probably get more gunk off your car than a machine or touchless wash, but there will be huge risk of scratches and \""spiderwebbing\"" because they use the dirtiest wash mitts I've ever seen. \n\nIf you love your paint, hand wash it yourself or use a touchless wash. \n\nIf you dont't care too much and don't like washing your own car take it here."
0;"Was quoted a price of $150.00 to fix a speeding ticket and paid it in full.  Weeks later received a letter stating that I owed an additional $145.00.  Ticket was $255.00 so I saved a total of $5.00.  Total misrepresentation, you can't quote one price and then weeks later send another bill paid directly to the court.  Woman in office Aurora lied through her teeth about the cost and when questioned after the fact said that the original $150.00 paid for the scaled Lawyer to go to court for you.  While there were no points or traffic school on the account, the additional money paid to the court should have been quoted up front instead of letting people \""assume\"" it was the final cost.  Total bullshit.  Don't use this crook."
4;Best place to get your beauty products, hands down. Everyone is friendly and helpful without being pushy. They have great deals if you sign up for their mailing list...sometimes they send cards in the mail with vouchers for a FREE full size product with any purchase. They have special ladies night out events with raffle prizes, and discounts on salon services. I have never left empty handed or without a smile on my face.\n\nFYI, they take ULTA coupons too!!! and you can stack them with your beauty brands take ten!!
1;Outdated rooms. An old crowd and no Jacuzzi
0;"I live in the neighborhood and really wanted to like the Grind.  After 3 visits, I'm done.\nOverview: Food is mediocre service has stayed consistently terrible.\n\nMy last visit was happy hour with my 3 co-workers.  I had suggested we try the place and we arrived by 5 to make sure we got a table before rush hour.  \nAfter waiting to be served for about 10 min., the waitress finally spotted us & got our drink order.  We waited another 10 min. to get the drinks even though they were not yet busy.  We asked to order dinner and she said she'd be right back.  15 min. later she came to get our order.  We had an appetizer and 4 burgers.  Appetizer came out with the burger with no apologies.\nAfter we received the food our server disappeared, so condiments and drink refills were ordered from other staff.  When she returned she interrupted our conversation to ask if we were done.  From this point on she returned to the table with the check (not asking about dessert or more drinks) every 5 min. to ask if we were done.\nFinally, she came by and leaned in to tell us that \""it's getting really busy in here and there are people waiting for a table.  I'm not asking you to go but just so you know.\""  Are you kidding me?! We had ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 2 drinks each, & wanted dessert but she needed our table! \nUnreal. I will not return."
0;I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito. This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water. Here's where the 1 star comes in. Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired. EVERY time I've ordered the same thing, and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table. There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long. My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times. 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration. Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again. Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later, but as I finally got up the courage to complain, the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies. I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that, I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore. Good Luck guys!!
4;Great location, you can bike right up too it...lawn is awesome and well layed out.  Bathrooms and concessions are right there.
1;Rather disappointed in this place actually. Food was good, not amazing , but good. But portion size , topped with poor service made it a place we'll skip when picking a quick dinner out. I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place.
3;Went Christmas shopping here this week and it had everything I need. Conveniently had all the frames I was looking for, in stock, and was able to get photo albums, stockings, and santa hats all in one place. Being located in Tempe Marketplace helps too. I will definitely be back to this location. \n\nBeware that parking is somewhat had to find during the holidays.
1;Slow service. A lot of people who were waiting before us left cause they were so slow, AND there were empty tables. Got seated and waited a good 30 min for our food.\n\nBurgers were good, I got the oxtail chili cheese fries. So not worth it, barely any oxtail, it was more like beans, cheese, and fries. Overall, stick to the burgers.
3;Great food and wonderful service. Here during breakfast hour. I will be back.
0;Well, I randomly came across this Noodle shop as I was wondering around into the Caesar's Palace, which is like a rat maze that is designed to never let you out. I was told that Caesar's Palace has one of the big cocktail drinks that everyone seemed to be carrying around in the street and there I got stuck in search of the damn drink. I started to get hungry and came across a bright white restaurant with ridiculous gold fish tanks. I was told that they hand roll their noodles and make their dumplings, so I convinced our party to stop by for lunch. Oof. Big mistake! We ordered the Beijing noodles, seafood noodle soup, Shanghai dumplings, and kungpao shrimp. All of them were complete misses. I am not sure if it was just us, but we completely failed on all our dishes. It might have been just a coincidence, but I think not. I think this place just sucks. It is overpriced for such a noodle shop and I have been lured in by the damn fish tanks. Damn it! And for those reviewers who gave 5 stars, what the hell did you eat? And what have you eaten all your life? Dog food?
3;Ate here twice on a 3 day visit. \nExcellent, charbroiled burger. I had the Tex-Mex, twice. Perfect both times. Pricey? I disagree, though I live in a resort town. Money and time well spent. Service was great and they seemed to enjoy what they were doing. And clean.\nYou won't regret it except if your a vegan..........
0;"Not impressed at all. Thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay. I was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us. The waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes, the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity. I mean doesn't she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us? It made no sense and she wouldn't or couldn't explain the theory behind it. After paying this \"" mandatory gratuity\"" we couldn't enjoy our dinner and decide to leave. I was really looking forward to the Wicked Spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had, it just didn't happen."
4;"even though i live roughly 15-20 minutes from this store, i still make it a weekly habit to come here for groceries. \n\nthe breakdown: \n\nsushi. their selection of rolls and sashimi are awesome! i love that i can buy a brick sized piece of salmon sashimi to take home and slice up myself. while i do love aj's sushi bar as well, whole foods definitely has them beat. \n\njuice bar. whenever i come in to do my shopping, i always head straight to the juice bar for one of their delicious fresh drinks. every juice mix i've tried has been fantastic, even if the fruit/veggie combo sounded like it might not work together.\n\nproduce. really terrific selection of fruits and vegetables. i especially love their huge variety of pre-cut produce; it makes cooking super convenient!\n\nin addition to carrying a lot of great companies that i can't get at any other local stores, their stuff is generally totally affordable.  a grocery store with a unique selection can mean higher prices (aj's), but i usually leave whole foods feeling pretty pleased with what i ended up spending. \n\nps. i'm super pumped for the new store that's opening on camelback next month! now i'll have a store within a mile of my house!"
0;"Terrible service at a recent visit.  It was a Monday around 7ish and my co-worker and I walked in to this place.  We didn't have a reservation as we just flew in to town.  But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \""oh did you want to just eat out here?\"".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \""crowd\""?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.  This is now on my must-avoid and do-not-recommend list."
3;"What better way to celebrate my 29th birthday than to try to live it up like I was turning 21? There are many reasons why I don't frequent these \""ultra high-end\"" nightclubs anymore, but I guess it was my lucky day. This was the first time I was on a guestlist with comp tickets and actually got in for free. No cover for a guy in Vegas? Unheard of. There was also no wait in the guestlist line. Dada Life was the headliner. \n\nPros: Aesthetics-wise, this nightclub is just as nice as any other. There's a nice lounge with benches for sitting without having to get bottle service. There's three different levels and plenty of space, except the main stage. \n\nCons: Stairs - apparently these are death for the ladies. There's no outdoor patio/pool area so it can get stuffy, but there's cool jets that blast the crowd every once in a while. Confetti is dropped every now and then, but the pieces stain your skin, especially the blue ones! The cost of a drink is ridiculous - a Red Bull/vodka was $25. So much cigarette and cigar smoke in an indoor setting.\n\nMark Eteson was the opener for Dada Life and was the only person I saw since apparently I'm old now and I can't make it to 2 am anymore. Still, I can say I had fun on my birthday at a Vegas club!"
4;"This place is awesome. Tasty burgers and fresh cut steak fries. Tons of options from the classic burger toppings, to saut\u00e9ed garlic and pesto! You can also get fried eggs or even pastrami!\n\nThe feel is super chill and great music. Sherl, the owner is super cool, and always helpful for first-timers.\n\nThirsty? How about one of the 16 flavors of lemonade?! I've been searching for the best burger in Phoenix, and this is up there with the chuckbox near ASU, Ted's in Cave Creek and Lucky Boy as far as a \""great burger\"" goes!"
3;A star was taken away for service and price.  Yes it is more food and better quality than your standard hibachi restaurant but the price is pretty ridiculous in comparison.  The server had to argue about doom alcohol on separate receipt since we were using a gov't credit card.  Don't get the sushi since it is way overpriced and not comparable to a sushi restaurant.  Unlike other Beni's this one does not offer a full sushi lineup, probably b/c there is a sushi bar next door.
2;It's a must see if you are visiting the west rim. But yes, it is a rip off. It's $80 to visit the site and walk on the skywalk. What makes this a really bad deal is the idea that you cannot even bring a camera/phone on the skywalk. The excuse that you might drop it in the canyon or on the glass is just another way for them to justify making money off of you by taking pictures for you and selling them to you. Seriously, why would anyone throw their couple hundred dollars phones/cameras away? The walk is a one time visit and will not get a second visit from me, for sure. However, if you've never seen it, you should go take a look.
2;I'd give them high marks for execution.  Everything was cooked properly, served promptly and efficiently.  Not a lot of creativity or soul beyond the menu preparation.  Typical for the Vegas high end joints that cater to people on business.  Like everything on The Strip prices are astronomical - I will never forgive a restaurant that charges $125 for a bottle of wine I can get for $25.\n\nThe hostesses seated everyone close together so it became very noisy even though the restaurant was half-empty.  No place charging these prices should make such mistakes. \n\nGreat place if you're on an expense account.  If it's your own money I would pick a different city.
1;As with any buffet, you get what you pay for.  This place is about $14 for dinner if I recall correctly.\n\nThe Mongolian grill section doesn't have much selection to choose from, but it's pretty yummy regardless.  The sushi is surprisingly good for buffet sushi.  Pot stickers are really good.  Pepper steak is excellent.  Orange chicken is decent.\n\nSo why only 2 stars?  Well, it's the tour groups.  The place is a madhouse when the tour groups come in.  It's just too crowded to find any sort of comfort.  Not to mention the people on the tour group are frequently rude and shove you and cut in line.  They used to only have tour groups on weekend nights.  They are there all the time now, even weekday lunches.  Not to be racist, but there is a cultural difference that I just can't wrap my head around.  I don't understand visiting a foreign country and eating a bastardized version of food from your homeland.
4;I loved Kokomo! I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo! The fruits were so fresh, and the topping section was clean, with a great variety! I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners! Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area!  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy! I highly recommend Kokomo!
2;"The Chandler location is located in a strip mall.  Strike one.\nThe decoration of the Chandler location looks very ...80's? Strike two. (  I don't know how to describe it.  The Havana Cafe's Chandler location just doesn't look modern or even retro; the interior just looked outdated.)\n\nThey got on base with the food.  We ordered \""Tostones\"", which are twice fried plantains with a mojo garlic sauce and an order of Empanaditas for the appetizers for four of us.    Both were satisfying.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered Pollo Cubano, chicken breast in light curry, lime, and garlic with sauteed sweet onions on top.   The winner at the table was the Gallina Frita, shredded chicken breast, pan fried with onions laced with a garlic sauce.   Can't decide from all the choices that sound good on the menu?  Do as my husband did and order the Dinner Sampler and try a variety.   At the end, we were too stuffed to try desert.  (Well, for the record, everyone else was too stuffed.  I would have been game to try something, but I didn't want to look like a pig :)\n\nI thought the food was good, but a overpriced for the meal.  Our service was spot on and attentative, but as the other reviews seemed to indicate, and our friends feedback validated, the service can be spotty.\n\nI say - try the place out.  We would definately go back."
1;Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's.
0;Tried this place twice and both times service was very slow and food was overpriced for what we got. Staff (including management) not very friendly or helpful. It's a shame bc I enjoy staying at this hotel.
2;Couple things on most recent visit-\nCalamari was surprisingly good\nWaitstaff still act in a haphazard manner, had 3 different waiters during night. Some of the younger ones went into back room and I speculate were drinking. I mean whatever but its a sign this place is possibly headed downhill\nMy steak ordered medium came out darn near rare and then after a heat up came back leather\nFinally, the bull that was out on Sahara is now in the backroom as some truck hit the pole it was on and knocked it off! A bit odd this long time iconic sign is gone and doesn't seem they will be putting it back up. Yet another sign this spot is not being run at a high end professional level.
0;Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches.
4;Great food, good selection of veg curries at buffet (choose from 6).\n\nFresh and tasty garlic naan.\n\nTastefully done interiors and decor.\n\nClean bathroom with diaper changing station.\n\nOur little one was sleeping, she woke up 10 mins before 3 pm (close) and they accommodated us for 15 mins after close while she ate.
3;This place has a pool with a clear floor. AMAZING. You can see straight down to the... parking entrance. Hilarious. The pool is pretty tiny - entirely for relaxing, no exercise here. \n\nThe usual Westin bed, Westin service (even for we F1 fans, not staff) were excellent.    Mandatory valet parking with excellently quick service and attentive desk staff. Pristine bathrooms and arranged essentials.
4;So my layover in Phoenix was three hours long (turned into six but that's a whole 'nother story...) Anyways, my cousin goes to ASU, so I called her up and had her get me for breakfast since I had a ton of time to kill.\n\nShe takes me to this little tiny place called Over Easy. Yay, it looks cute. It also looks like (by looking at the building) it used to be a Taco Bell back in the day. Ah oh!\n\nWHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA!? I actually liked the 'Over Easy' entree that I got. Filled me up and while it wasn't gourmet or anything, it was the next best thing. Also, it's helpful to mention that there is nothing on the menu over 10.00 - nothing. All you ASU kids should eat here.\n\nFinally, the crappy thing about running a business in the middle of an Arizona desert is that you're sometimes gonna get some Arizona desert clientele. Let me just say that the service is amazing. EVEN THOUGH there were some genuine straight from the trailer park douchebags in there. Had to say it. I love you Over Easy.
2;"Aria is a relatively new and nice hotel. The staffs are friendly. The casino is very straight forward and organized. I love how Jean Philippe is by the guest rooms so very convenient for breakfast, snack and coffee. \n\nThe guest rooms hallway is super confusing. It was never-ending and it criss-cross at some point...imagine finding your room if you're drunk. \n\nThe room is nice. I like how it's pretty automatic with the window and \""service\"" and \""private\"" button and all. I like how the shower is connected to the tub. Thre room is pretty clean and spacious.\n\nThe pool is nice along with three jacuzzi. I like how you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the pool. You just have to go to the promenade floor. But it's weird, it seems like the pool is open to anyone public and not just hotel guess. \n\n I like how they have a tram that's connected to Bellagio and Crystals. The Cosmopolitan is also just few minute walks away. It's super convenient!! Will definitely like to stay there again."
4;I just recently discovered Aerial Yoga from a friend and I'm totally addicted!!!  Altitude Aerials has a Aerial Yoga class on Saturday and Sunday and not only is it an amazing workout, and fun to do, but it's affordable too!\n\nMy review is based only on the Aerial Yoga classes... I haven't been to any of their Aerial shows or training yet but I do plan on it!
0;"Being in the restaurant business I understand times are tough. Any type of promotion to bring in guests that is feasible would give the \""edge\"" to a particular business. Frequenting this particular applebees I felt like I just walked into club applebees. The volume is way over the top. Service was compatible to a crowded bar with one bartender to serve. I sat at a table to wait 10 minutes before even being greeted by my server. With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell. The identity is in question, the food is a pathetic excuse for a full service franchise, and service that I could find in a dive bar. Highly disappointed in this franchise as of late. Past three visits to different area locations have ended in similar fashion. So sad."
4;5 star worthy. I'd give it 6 stars if Yelp would let me. It's all about the hot signature sandwiches here. All sandwiches are made to order making them fresh out of the oven. Fresh ingredients (make sure to add bacon)  served up on a nicely toasted Artisan baked loaf and topped with unique sauces and spreads. Try the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (my favorites!)
0;Came here for dinner. Quick seating and low price $20.\nThe atmosphere feels very old-medieval-esque. To my taste, too dull and quiet. Not too many young people either. Mainly middle-aged and on, or small families.\nMy waitress wasn't responsive. Once we had our order of drinks, that was it, she never returned.\nThe food selection is mediocre. Most of the chefs don't smile and seem to growl every time you request something.\nThere's a Mongolian section where you select your vegetables and your meat option. The chef makes the plate of food for you within 5 minutes. But, the leftover food bits from the previous order(s) weren't fully scraped off. Had little black bits throughout my plate. Hate to waste food, but definitely not risking my stomach.\nBest choice for me was the porkchops. Soft and tasty. Everything else, meh. Even the desserts weren't to par.\nVery disappointed.
4;I'm practically at this spot everyday. I often wonder why people still drink the burned tar that is Starbucks. I love this location because the staff is amazing- Todd and Kevin are the best (we love Limor on the weekends). I'm so glad to see Caribou offer different tea lattes. Love it. They offer so many more options than just coffee- and the prices are reasonable....and not too mention you're not bombarded by buying knick nacks and CD's. The Mocha Latte is excellent and my husband usually goes for the Mint Condition- they offer 3 different choices of chocolates in your beverage (if it calls for it), which is a nice added option. You can mix up different beverages and flavors and I love the different flavors you can get around the holidays as well. Check it out. Drop Starbucks.
3;I never have any complaints about this location whenever I come by. This is a recommended place to get pho if you're in the area. \n\nI hardly ever deviate from getting pho when I go to a pho place, but the few times I have had rice dishes here, I haven't been disappointed. I personally am a fan of broken rice because I like the small grains, I find them easier to chew and more enjoyable. The pork and chicken are cooked fairly well with a good amount of flavor in each bite. The pho itself is nothing too out of the ordinary. The noodles are good, the meat is good, the broth is good, what more do you want?\n\nThe restaurant itself feels very clean and orderly. Like at Pho So 1, the food there is good as well, but everything always feels so disorderly and it just feels like it could be a bit cleaner, Jenni Pho doesn't have that problem. \n\nI'm not loyal to any pho place in Las Vegas, but Jenni Pho is definitely added to the pool of pho places in the city.
2;"An okay bakery, but is it a five star lunch spot? No. True to its confectionary specialties, the food here is sweet- and I mean everything is sweet. The sticky sweet croissants, the salads that are peppered with honey and candied nuts, the pita sandwiches that are oddly stuffed with whole oranges (pith and all) and sweet pickle, even the simple vegetable soup that overwhelmingly tasted like sweet potatoes and allspice- absolutely every dish served to us here incorporated fruits or honey, transmogrifying a savory lunch into a toothache inducing sugar fest. I can understand how the sweet-savory thing can appeal to some people (like, I don't know, pre-diabetics and your typical Waldorf salad eating American sugar addict), but I can't stand it. The staff is extremely friendly and well-acquainted with their sacrosanct Yelp referrals; in fact, they're almost too friendly... like guilt you into writing a good review for some free baklava friendly. Further, to my understanding, the only thing organic here is the wheat flour they use in their breads- big deal? Nothing that I love about Mediterranean food came through here - the sumac, the pungent garlic, the lamb, the kebabs, the fresh roasted vegetables... you won't find any of it here. Overall, an average bakery (the baklava and pinwheels were good- but I'm not orgasmic over them), but lunch? Eh..."
0;The owner runs this joint with an iron fist and if you cross paths with him you'll feel like you in a North Korean labor camp :) It is fun to watch him on small doses\nThe place is nice and clean and above all you feel safe inside ..\nWifi is pretty solid also\n\nupdate, I've been here on few other occasions to wash my bed stuff and homeless are always around some wash in the bathroom and while the owner chases them away its not safe .. i will find a better one for the future
3;IT WOULD'VE BEEN 5 STARS BUT THE WAITRESS WAS BITCHY AT FIRST!\n\nBeing a HUGE Sex and The City fan, I had to go to this place.  The decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  Red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nOur visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nThe menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.\n\nI loved this place.  With the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  I WILL BE GOING BACK!  I LOVE SUSHI SAMBA!!!!!!!
2;"The Skinny: great customer service when booking by phone (5!) but a show that lacks spectacle and story (3).\n\nOkay, the travelzoo promotion site was down so I had to call the reservation line to book tickets for La Reve this weekend. Expecting to wait on the line for at least 2-3 minutes, I'd settled down with a cup of tea, a book and comfy slippers.\n\nTo my surprise, the phone was answered in less than a minute. I'm not even sure I heard the dialtone! The lady on the line was super friendly and took my order for 3 tickets right away. We started chatting about Vegas and I mentioned that I was a local.\n\n\""A local? Let me look and see if the locals deal can apply to your tickets for you.\"" Say what? \""Okay, it looks like the locals deal is better for you. Let me go ahead and apply that discount.\"" But I looked online and there wasn't a locals deal advertised currently. \""Sometimes we don't advertise about the local deal but the promotion is ongoing.\"" Sweet! How's that for excellent customer service? That is 5-star service folks!\n\nNow on to the actual performance.\n\nLe Reve is definitely a dream... like as in the what-the-hell-is-going-on-here kind of nightmare. At its essence, the show lacked that one key thread that holds everything together - a storyline.\n\nIt starts off with this girl in white with her boyfriend who sits on a park bench which becomes immersed in water. Then the girl is dressed in red. Let the odd dreams sequences with all these bald dudes begin!\n\nReally, the best parts of the show were the clowns. They literally stole the show and ought to have a larger role throughout the piece. They seemed to be the only ones during the show that actually were trying to tell the audience something. \n\nThere is a lot of dancing/synchronized swimming so don't expect many acrobatic feats during this production. Not to mention the majority of the acrobatic feats are aerial in nature. So if you don't like aerialists or dancers, don't go to this show!\n\nTo be honest with you, I think that the acrobats/dancers must work their patootie off for this production because they definitely perform numerous roles within the show. However it's a major flaw that these obviously talented, versatile people don't get their moment to shine. During the show, there's so many things going on all at once, the actual performance of the individuals gets lost in the frey. It's a too much sensory overload and it shows.\n\nAlthough some of the sequences were quite beautiful, they lack cohesiveness and personality to make this a truly great show. For that, this show gets a 3 starred review."
3;"I love Korean BBQ and this place won't disappoint you. their food is very tasty and they offer different options for everyone. we ordered a \""combo\"" for two which included a soda or rice alcohol drink (kind of strong) and 3 different types of meats.  They are also open extended hours. \nservice: Fair\nprep time: 8 Min\natmosphere:  relaxing, good place to enjoy with a group of friends\nBest Thing: at the end of your BBQ meal you can enjoy some fried rice.\nworst thing: they do not offer a lot of the small sides that other Korean restaurants have\nPrice: one of the best prices in town"
3;Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las Vegas and far, far away from any parking, the Auld Dubliner is still one of the best Irish pubs in town.  Pretty much because the bar understands that a pub should be low key and classic.  In Ireland, a pub is just a run of the mill watering hole.  But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  \n\nNot the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   \n\nBut they also serve up a solid pub menu.  When we went, we had deep fried chips with curry (yum) and a couple of solid cheese burgers topped with Irish cheddar cheese.  The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.\n\nI hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks.
1;I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip.
1;I remember in elementary school I had a friend of mine who regaled me with wild stories of how excellent the buffet was at the Rio. Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.\n\nWhat I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.\n\nA few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.\n\nWe got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.\n\nSo, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity. And guess what? You'll still get a filling, delicious meal!
4;Two type of services they offer... Full service (interior and exterior) and exterior washing.  First visit and impress with service. Car is extremely clean with a extra fee to clean bugs out for $5.00 which is fine with me.. Will definitely come back to get my car clean again.. Thanks guys for the awesome job..
1;Goodness gracious...I needed some fro-yo and some hand picked toppings. Saw the Red Mango sign and damn...I was ready! \n\nNow, not all Red Mango's are not the same. I am use to my Red Mango where you get eight flavors to choose from, choose how much you want to put in your cup and pick your own toppings. No self serve here:( \n\nSo, I watched as the girl put more yogurt than I asked her to. I couldn't believe each topping was .75. I watched as she meticulously put each blackberry on one through six. Then she honored my request of mochi balls and dumped a spoonful on top. \n\n\nI guess I like the experience of getting exactly what I want, measuring it out myself, weighing it and paying for it. Yes, I know, I could have gone elsewhere but it's all good. \n\nRed Mango is some delicious fro-YO! Perfect stop to chill and cool off after being in the Vegas heat.
0;This Starbucks is the worst I've been to. They don't get your name when you order (which I believe is company policy). They don't even say the name of the drink they put on the counter so it's essentially just best guess as to what drink belongs to who.   And don't ask the baristas, I believe they enjoy the confusion. I'm yet to get what I ordered and the white chocolate soy milk latte I took home last week was quite terrible.\nJust go somewhere else. It's truly not worth it.
2;Happy hour is great here at this restaurant....However you can tell they are part of a big chain working to cut costs where they can.....We tried dinner there last night....The Filet was very dry for med rare ....I have had better on my own grill purchased from a local grocery.....The shrimp cocktail is supposed to be huge shrimp as an appetizer for $17.00 and these were quite small, .the kind you would find commonly anywhere. with no flavor...The single loaf of bread was cold and the outside of it was not crispy....The butter options were good though....My other half enjoyed the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...Overall for the price of dinner, I would not go back....HOWEVER I would do happy hour there again.....The happy hour menu is good and the prices are great.... I DO WANT TO SAY THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT ARE IMPECCABLE....TRAINED WELL AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE.....
2;The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.\n\nThey lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.\n\nI will try this place again hoping it was a fluke.
1;It's a standard Super 8 two star. Clean enough, nothing fancy, and some funny smells here and there. Sirens outside throughout the night. The night clerk said a few things that didn't make sense and were confusing. The thin door to the next room let me hear the dude coughing all night. These are all pretty standard for this type of hotel, but all together I'd probably consider staying somewhere else if I had to stay another night.
3;We got a two room suite with a kitchenette. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is great. They have a full breakfast Buffett that is delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They also have a shuttle that takes you right to the strip.
1;What's up with this place ... it is not open during posted hours. Chairs are turned upside down on the tables, door locked, and an [Open] sign is still hung in window. I was there 8:00am (closed) Fri. 4/1 - posted hours 7:00am. I was there 9:00am (still closed) ... what's going on? Also have driven by in early afternoon, closed.\n\nTheir ad in the 4-2-11 Chandler Republic states:\n\nNow Open Melted Cheese Kitchen\n\nopen 7am to 3pm Monday - Saturday for Breakfast & Lunch\n\nwhat gives?\n\nI'm willing to spend money and the place is not open.
1;Plus - cabby got me home in record time.  \n\nMinus - it wasn't without a fair amount of drama.  Driver was aggressive to anyone who was in his way or didn't move fast enough, slowing down to give dirty looks to anyone who displeased him.  When we arrived at Aria he almost got in a fight with a limo driver who he mean mugged for no reason.  You have a choice in this town.  i'll turn these guys down from now on.  These cabbies always complain there is not enough work.  Then when they get it, they do this?
4;Edinburgh castle has got to be the number one must see attraction within Edinburgh.  Due to the location of the castle, high on an extinct volcanic hill, it overlooks the entire city.  Almost anywhere in the city you can gaze up and see the castle.  It looks amazing in the morning fog and even more spectacular in the afternoon sun.\n\nThis is probably one of the largest castle compounds which I have toured as well.  The castle is quite well maintained and you can get stunning pictures both outside the city walls and within.\n\nOnce inside the castle there is a free guided tour which will walk you through the outside explaining all of the things to see in the castle.  I have been twice and enjoyed this part of the castle tour each time.  I recommend walking with this guided tour (it lasts about a half hour) and then independently exploring the different areas.  The crown jewels, the chapel, the dungeons, the war memorial and the WWI memorial with the top of the black volcanic mountain poking through the floor are probably my most favorite areas to explore.\n\nOn nice days and probably the weekends, the ticket line can be quite long however you can order online in advance or order from the hop on, hop off bus tours and walk straight through.  This saved us some time on our second trip to Edinburgh as our first trip, I spent about a half hour waiting.
3;I was disappointed that they were not doing take out anymore, however, we came in today and i was extremely impressed with their food AND customer service. They really made the ordering process super easy.
1;Not worth the money! Today was my step sons bday and his mother arranged a party here. The cost for the package was $240, and included pizza, soda, and decorations and a free round of laser tag and mini golf. We payed an extra $90 to add more kids because it only included 15. None of this bothered me til we got there and had to ask for cutlery,  they provided the cake,  but no cake cutter, no tokens for the kids to play games, the bathroom was disgusting. To top it all off, we were only given an hour and a half,  to eat, have cake, play games, and they were rushing us before we could even open gifts! Any person with kids knows it takes a lot longer to have a party, and for what we paid they should be able to not rush through this! Good news is the birthday boy had a blast, but we won't be returning,  too expensive and it's not worth it!!
0;This place had such good reviews so I was excited. And then very disappointed. The room itself was nice (If you ignore the dent in the wall by the bed and stain on the chair). And it was cool that we got to use the MGM pool (after walking a mile but that is just MGM in general.) But that is where my happiness stopped. This place is expensive and a high star-rated hotel- I expect excellent service because of it. I couldn't check in early (despite the fact that when I booked it they told me I could for a fee), fine- that's life I'll wait at the pool till check-in.  Then I had to wait in line to check my bags with the bell hop. Then at check-in I had to wait in another 30 min. line to check-in (if you are that full- have more people there to help!!) Then to continue my day full of waiting- I had to wait another 45 mins for the bell hop to bring my bags up to me while I sit in my wet bathing suit and wanting to shower but have nothing to change into.  The valet took about 20 mins to get my car, and they clearly parked it in the hot sun not in a garage, because it was hot when we got it. I didn't get the promised VIP tickets to the clubs I was supposed to receive. I didn't get the corner room I was promised at the desk. And the employees were all very snickety instead of polite and helpful. When spending money at a luxury hotel, I expect luxury results. I will not be staying here ever again.
4;OMG! This place is awesome...my husband and I were visiting Vegas for work and wanted to eat some good sushi and based on the reviews here, we decided to check this place out...the service was amazing top notch.. Really. I never went to an all you can eat sushi and chefs and waitresses tell you to try everything and this and that... I first thought those items are extra charge since they were asking constantly. But, man this place is great... The fish, the dishes were fresh and tasty... Everyone was so friendly and fun.. Definitely coming back the next time...
4;First let me start off by saying what a wonderful experience my furniture shopping turned out to be! My wife and I moved into our new house and realized we had no furniture to full our 1800 sqft, so we went on down to walker and were greeted but not pestered by many sales people who were eager to ensure we were finding everything to our satisfaction. The sales person whom we actually felt with was a really awesome guy named Richard (I recommend him to anyone reading this), Richard found on standing puzzled near a really huge king size bed set that both my wife and I really liked, we were puzzled because we didn't know how the pricing worked if we wanted to buy only certain pieces rather than the entire set. Richard was very helpful and even got us a 20% discount on an already on sale item and this really surprised my wife and I :) the experience for my wife and I was almost like just running into a friend who also sold furniture becsuse Richard made us really feel at ease so much so that we even invited him to my wife's bday which was the following weekend! The furniture was delivered on time and exactly as promised and we are very very satisfied with our Walker furniture experience and see no other reason to shop anywhere else in the future :) on a side note our sales person didn't make it out to the wife's bday but the following weekend we did get a very thoughtful bday card and a $25 gift card to century theaters as a thank you/happy birthday, I call that a great customer experience!  Thanks Richard and Walker.
3;Cupcake Heaven!!  Well... only because I haven't physically been to Yummy Cupcakes in LA - so a direct comparison is still pending.  So, a 5-star update may be in the future.\n\nHere at Mad Hatter you can actually custom build your own 4 layer cupcakes! ... Observe\n\nFirst, you start off with the type of cake.  Choose from flavors such as classic chocolate, vanilla bean, red velvet and several others.\n\nThen you choose what type of oooey-gooey filling you want in it.   Chocolate Ganache, White chocolate Ganace, Banana creme, Orange creme, etc etc etc ,there are literally over a dozen choices.\n\nNext comes the topping ... More Chocolate?  More Vanilla? More White Chocolate? Cream Chees perhaps? Ahhhhhh the Choices !!\n\nWhat??? One more choice??!?. Pick a Topper!  A Bite Sized Butterfinger? Baby Ruth? Snickers? Kit Kat? Twix? Chocolate chip cookie?  A C-3PO HEAD??! yes, you can so choose that if you wish.\n\nCupcakes are $3.25each and can also be bought in Half Dozens($19.50) and Dozens($36.00).\n\nConveniently located just a stone's throw away from Cupcake Lane at the Target Plaza on Ft Apache/215, so we were able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAt Mad Hatter, I went for the Red Velvet, with Orange Creme filling and White Chocolate creme topping\n\nI Then went next door to Cupcake lane for their Red Velvet with cream cheese topping.....sadly, it was no contest.   Mad Hatter wins that comparison, hands-down.  Maybe it's not a fair comparison... after all, I custom made the cupcake at Mad Hatter. \n\nBut, no worries.  There will be further direct comparisons in the future
1;Ich finde die Atmosph\u00e4re ganz gut, es ist viel Platz und das Personal war nett. \n\nDas Essen war sehr sehr sehr fettig. In dem Moment war es ganz ok, aber im Nachgang widersteht es mir total.
3;"Came here on a Saturday night with my man friend and were pleasantly surprised at the emptiness of the restaurant.. ( I really hate waiting.. who doesn't?) Any who.. we already knew what we wanted to get before coming here.. \n\nKaraage _ Like everyone has already said.. It is delish!!! Crispy but not oily~ good portion too~!\n\nFukumimi ramen_ i asked to add some garlic oil to it but I don't know if that even made a difference. I thought it was pretty tasty.. Pretty rich but not TOO porky.. and not overly salty like Monta's ... & Noodles were cooked perfectly.\n\nTan Tan Men_ It was my first time trying this dish and I thought it was pretty good.. It had some sort of deep nutty flavor to it.. I don't really like nuts that much LOL so i was good just stealing a couple bites from my bf~ \n\nKimchi_ my BF really liked their kimchi haha it is more of the fresher variety so it didn't have that fermented sour taste that I like.. \n\nNice waitresses & chefs, fast service! Check it out if you're in the area ;]]]"
2;Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I got the falafel-the pita was very good but the actually falafel balls were very dry.
3;this stores great for both foods, daily needs and customer service! I only went in there for a few minutes but dealt with about 3 different people and all were absolutely great. everyone is so friendly and easy going.\n\nplus they sell hcg1234.\n\nim just sayin... =)
2;I enjoyed a nice spring day in Scottsdale at the patio of Stingray Sushi.  I have to say the ambiance of the restaurant fit well with the feeling I had that day.  The unagi and tuna sashimis were excellent.  The one problem I had is that the entire time our waitress didn't realize that we didn't have the little dipping square for our soy sauce and wasabi.  I was waiting the entire time to see if they would notice, but I let it go and compensated by using my plate for my soy sauce.  I didn't really care, but I was curious to see if they would even notice or offer it.  It wasn't even a busy service, so I give a star less than I would normally give for lack of attention.
4;I used to take my Civic to Honda for everything that needed to be done. I am so glad that Mori is my go to guy since then, my family also brings their cars to have him fix them. He is honest and his work is perfect. His prices are much more realistic than the dealership. You will save more money by going to Mori at this shop. You will have it fixed in a timely manner too. Even for major work. Thumbs up to this shop and to Mori.
1;Sister and I were hungry at 10 PM on a Sunday night and were looking for some Mexican delight. Pepe's Tacos had recently opened up near our house and we decided to get down.\n\nI ordered three tacos: carne asada, lengua, and al pastor. The lengua and the carne asada were decent. Not horrible, but not stand out. The star of my taco trio was the al pastor. The marinated pork, cilantro, onion, a squeeze of lime, a touch of the hot sauce. AMAZING! Definitely a must try. \n\nMy sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it. Didn't really pack much of a punch. The rice and beans were okay as well.\n\nPepe's is open 24 hours and has a wide variety of offerings that are all cooked to order. They have a traditional taco salsa bar, with the red hot spicy sauce of death (which I love) and a green, mild salsa. The carrot, onion, jalapeno mix. Radishes. \n\nThis location was clean, brightly lit. The staff was friendly. Pepe's is a decent taco shop. A step up from Roberto's, but not a home run.
1;Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. \n\nRamen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. \n\nBroth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. \n\nBroth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.\n\nChashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. \n\nTamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.\n\nAlcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)\n\nService: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem \n \nParking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. \n\nWait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly
3;It's been over a year since I was here and promised to leave a review. Why wait that long?  \n\nOne benefit is that I can say that the work done has stood the test of time and other than the title it would be hard for someone not very well versed in used cars to tell it was ever in an accident. \n\nThe process of working with LG was very good with  some phone tag, but not excessively so. There were complications from the kind of accident it was and insurance companies involvment that caused delays  plus the difficulty of getting parts from Japan at the time made it hard to get a handle on how long it would take for me to rent a car for.   In the end they helped me out on the deductible as their site says and a few days car rental so It was fair. \n\n I'd be more than happy to take a car back here should the need arise and I'm pretty sure you'll be  in the 4-5 star range when you do.    For me 4.5
0;Ridiculous way to run a business. TERRIBLE phone service (even the employees comment on how poor it is) with RIDICULOUS hold times (in excess of 15 minutes EVERY TIME). To see the SAME specialist for the SAME condition in a three week period requires going back to square one and getting yet another referral from the primary care doctor and then waiting ANOTHER SIX WEEKS before you get in to see the doctor again. There are too many health care options to settle for such ignorance and poor service. You're FIRED!
2;I have seen this show 3 times now since 2008. It's a great way to get dinner and a cheap show. I have heard from people who have been to medieval times that it's very similar but since I haven't been there, I can't judge. \n\nLast nights experience wasn't as good as the first couple times but it was still good. My fianc\u00e9s chicken was very moist but mine was pretty dried out. All else was good except that my waiter didn't refill my drink until the show was almost over (it had been empty for 15 minutes and he walked by it 4 times but never stopped) he did fill my fianc\u00e9's cup but she was drinking something different and I guess he couldn't be bothered to bring the sprite to me. \n\nThe show was good as always but I missed the acrobat that used to perform at the end that has been replaced by the show horse. Oh well. I still enjoyed it and would probably do it again for a decent show and meal at a good price.  I recommend it.
3;Very good pub food. Had the Pub Spots, Deviled Eggs and Crisps I recommend this place.
4;I vacillated between four and five stars for this place due to the fact that when I hold it up to all of the restaurant experiences and food I have had, it fits more into a four star but when I compare it to other Vegas dining experiences, it is a clear five so five it is!\n\nBasically, it is just a really nice place with a great menu, superb service, and delicious food.  We started with oysters on the half shell which were excellently shucked and wonderfully fresh. Moved to two salads, one with blue cheese and walnuts, the other with warm goat cheese over dressed greens which were both executed well and were complimented with fresh chewy delicious bread. \n\nFor entrees, my husband had the lamb and I had the chicken. We also opted for sides of mushrooms and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent however the mushrooms were over salted. Considering this wasn't a theme in the meal, I won't hold it against them. \n\nAll of this was accompanied with a nice and inexpensive bottle of white wine which was served and presented as if it was a $300 bottle. That kind of service is always an indicator of a well run restaurant and an attentive staff. Overall cost of the meal was expensive but very, very fairly priced for when we got. \n\nAfter visiting a wide array of places in Vegas, I would recommend this place as a must!
0;Avoid this place! Happy hour is a joke, our bill came to a 100.00 for 6 drinks and 2 meals! We asked for a double on vodka and soda and it came in the same small glass as a single and tasted exactly like the single serving. After a 5 of them, we asked the waitress what is the cost for vodka and soda doubles. She said well happy hour is 5.25 and 7.25 for double. Them came back and said, I was wrong they are a $11.50!! What?!? Double charge for an extra half a shot!?! We were ordering something simple and it was supposed to be happy hour and by No means did we think they would double the charge for the same size drink with no more of a punch that the singles! No bars in Phoenix charge this but this place! The manager was confronted because 1. Her wait staff should inform people of the outrageous pricing when they order and ours was shocked of the price! 2. She needs to do some research with other bars and realize this is a rip off! The manager justified their charges, but credited a couple of shots we did. Very small gesture but a gesture! Food is ok, waitress neglected us most of night, atmosphere only thing nice about this place. Our table spent well over $300.00 for just 4 hours of being there, so what does that tell you? Ridiculous! We left without even a slight buzz (which is strange because they were supposedly 2 shots per drink) and we did 2 shot of tequila...fishy if you ask me! We will NEVER be back and I hope this helps you to ask about their prices before you order because the staff will not tell you! We will stay with the reasonable and respectable places we have been going to for years!!! This place is a huge disappointment!
2;It was nicely air conditioned.  The only downfall is lack of seating.  Most of the venues are standing only.  Not too great when you are standing for hours.  I probably would have stayed through the whole concert if I wasn't already standing during the opening act.
1;Save your money and your time... your taste buds will thank you.\n\nI'll start with the service.  Pretty lousy actually, even for a Korean place.  I had to actually get up and request soybean paste b/c I couldn't wait any longer.  Crappy service.\n\nThe side dishes lacked flavor and pizazz.  Totally unimpressed.  The BBQ meat lacked flavor and more importantly, tasted BOILED.  I'm not kidding my first impression was Yoshinoya beef bowl (Cali folks will understand this), seriously.  I saw no physical indication of bbq'ing, nor did it taste like it.... the bottom of the iron dish was filled with liquid like they had just removed it from boiling water.  We also got this specialty rice bowl with beef and veggies was only good when smothered in hot sauce.\n\nTotally unimpressed and will not come back.
4;"I love, love, love Thai Basil! It is fast, reasonably priced and, best of all, DELICIOUS! One thing that is really great is they have a lunch special for $6.95 that includes a cup of a vegetable broth soup, entr\u00e9e and egg roll (the menu said \""fruit\"" also, but it's really just a slice of orange to drizzle on your entr\u00e9e, which is a nice touch). I think their Thai iced tea is fabulous also. It's a classy place and yet feels very comfortable, and you know it must be good because a lot of people of Asian descent eat here on a regular basis. My favorite dishes are the noodle ones, like pad thai and pad-see-ew, hubby likes the rice dishes, but we both go for the tofu. It's nice to be able to eat totally vegetarian and have a delicious filling meal. If you're like us, you'll go back again and again!"
4;excellent work from start to finish!  (which was only one day for the entire remove-and-replace of my 1200sf ranch)  ...we had previously been burned by a disreputable roofing company, but tyler was consistently patient and understanding through my many questions, and helped me work through hiccups with insurance payment(s) long after the work had been completed.\nthe crew was efficient and deliberate in their methods, and they left the jobsite almost exactly as they had arrived (except, of course, for the beautiful new roof).  tyler was always available to answer questions about the project before they got underway, as well as after completion.\nfinding a roofer can be a daunting task, but i would strongly recommend you allow johnson roofing to take a look at your project and find out, first hand, just how easy roof replacement can be...
3;I really enjoy Donato's. The food is terrific-love the pasta sauce and chocolate rubbed steak!! Great wine list!!!\n\nI've taken company, out of towners, etc. there. Really impressive!
2;"I decided to stop in before going to see Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena. I was off to a late start but wanted to enjoy a good meal before the show to make a night of it. \n\nI enjoyed the ambiance of the place right off. The usual dark wood and dark booths but I liked the decor. It just looked 'comfortable' to me for lack of a better word. \n\nThe place was busy....most of it seemed pre-concert rush. I was told my server would be right there and then in a minute or so the manager came over to get a drink order. My server was at an adjacent table and seemed to be dealing with a 'problem' table. From what I could hear it seemed to be one of those \""I want this....BUT with this and not with that...and with this on the side....\"" type of tables. So he was busy. \n\nThey had a special menu that was featuring a pork tenderloin with a maple glaze that sounded really good. I did ask the server if it was a quick dish to come out and was told they were all ready out of it for the evening. Which was fine....hey, you snooze, you lose. So I ordered the goat cheese ravioli. \n\nIt came out pretty quick and I was actually quite impressed with the dish. It was served with some sauteed spinach and had a handful of pine nuts tossed in. Pasta, goat cheese, spinach, pine nuts....right up my alley. Don't think they could go wrong with that for me if they tried. \n\nOn the special menu they were offering a pumpkin cheesecake which sounded awfully good to me. I checked the time and I was doing pretty good so I was debating if I should get a slice. \n\nWell, all of a sudden my server dropped off my check. \""Whenever you're ready\"". Okay....no dessert I guess. He picked up my empty plate and was gone. \n\nI wasn't quite sure if he knew I was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there. I did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so I'm not sure if he just assumed I was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what. As a whole I really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while I'm still eating...but I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one. \n\nOn the way out I did ask when they closed because I was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that wouldn't work. \n\nSo, next time I'm in the area I'd like to check it out again when I have some more time. Some of the menu items sounded pretty good and like I said earlier I did enjoy the atmosphere so I would like to relax and enjoy a meal there at a not so hectic time. \n\nA solid three stars.....and hopefully will bump it up with a review update when I get to visit a second time."
3;Archis is was one of the better Thai food restaurants in Vegas. I've been going here for years. I usually get the Penang, Thai beef salad, pad kea mow. Can't go wrong with any of those.
2;Just as the title implies the burgers are flame broiled to perfection. I have never had a bad burger here. \n   It's a little on the expensive side, but if your craving a specialty burger it's totally worth it. \n   The downside is that unfortunately most other things on the menu aren't really worth the money. The hotdogs are small and the gyros aren't exactly the best either. luckily the fries are not to salty and have a home made taste.\n   There a good areas to eat outside and there is a drive through window. Also they can deliver in most cases which is always a nice treat.
4;Legit.\n\nThe Barrymore has been a seminal contribution to the post-2009 Las Vegas lounge renaissance.  \n\nThe restaurant is small, the service is old Vegas both in style and literally, with some wait staff known to discriminating customers for decades here.  They seem to know when to show up and when to leave you to your conversation.  The booths are classic design and the ambiance almost unmatched.  The menu is sophisticated French fusion.  Beautiful presentations which the chef makes sure are as you like them.\n\nThe bar has an outdoor patio heated in the winter.  Inside is a small lounge area at which they often have some of the best entertainers in Las Vegas, including Nieve Malandra singing jazz and standards. \n\nThe room off the east end of the bar could use some re-thinking, perhaps best for private events only.  Be sure to be seated in the main restaurant for dining.  Full menu at the bar and the perfect cocktail join a large wine list.  \n\nThe design is a very sophisticated theme based on the Barrymore motion picture family.  Well done and one of my favorite haunts.
3;"This is my \""go-to\"" spot. I normally order pho Bo vien large extra meatball and a large tsingtao. I like the larger sizes of meatballs they use and the broth is pretty delicious. This place is usually good on getting your pho to you in a timely manner, but the the same could be said with most pho places since it's not that difficult to prepare. I have yet to venture from my usual but when I do, I shall review it."
2;Can't beat the 99 cent Bloody Mary's in the morning. We had a super bar tender that made ours extra spicy. The mexican breakfast was delicious.
1;Like Yelps awesome description for each star ranking,this place is really just ''meh''.\n\nGreat place to JUST have drinks on the terrace during the warm summer days/nights.\n\nFood: I mean, it's Italian food. There's really nothing 'that' great about it, and without tooting my own horn, I feel there's a lot of things on the menu that my friends and I could make. But yes, it is good.\n\nStaff : Nothing special, but nothing bad neither. \n\nDecor/ambiance : probably one of the good things of this place. It has a nice urban/old style to it. \nLOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This place is perfectly located on one of the most touristy streets in the city. \n\nI'd take friends there only if we haven't made plans/reservations. It's acceptable.
0;After being gone for nearly two months, the far to overzealous sign spinner employed by this business IS UNFORTUNATELY BACK at 202 and Chandler and the manager of this place hung up on me when I was discussing the problem again.  I guess I'll have to resort to uploading to youtube the dash-cam videos of this idiot sign spinner repeatedly dropping his sign in the street and the antics and lengths he goes to to get attention for this business which is obviously not successful enough with its existing customer base to stay in business.  Businesses that are successful and packed do so by remembering who the customer is and providing a good product at a fair price, NOT by trying to attract so much attention that they risk causing traffic accidents and repeatedly annoy drivers to the point they call the police!  The traffic accident most likely to occur is one where a driver is trying to turn the corner and is distracted by this idiot's sign or yelling and they get hit T-bone style RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS DOOR!  I knew someone that was T-boned in the drivers side and SHE AND HER 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ARE DEAD!!!!!  If you want to take back our streets from the idiot sign spinners like the one used by this business, DON'T GO THERE!!!  I would never again think of going to this business!
0;Over priced and no customer service.
1;It's ok. Pretending to be the real St-viateur. but the bagels aren't as good. I'd give it a 2.5 if they would let me.
4;We frequent here often but I'd never taken the time to post a review. I cannot say a negative thing about Cyprus. The staff are amazing. They are prompt to serve us and the food is always fast and fresh. They have opened a new location in Chandler and we have been there quite a few times as well. I can honestly say they do everything right and it is consistent at both locations. \n\nGreek fries are a must and my husband loves the gyro pita and I love the chicken souvlaki pita.
2;"An A.D.D. sports fan's dream! We were in Scottsdale for the weekend and wanted to watch the UFC event and have drinks and food.......we ended up here!\n\nThe waitresses appear to be Hooters' girls prior to enhancement. Cute outfits and pretty gals.\n\nThe service was a tad slow but the waitress was working her butt off, as it was busy due to it being an Oklahoma game and this being the local alums hangout. There were screens all around, friendly people, good atmosphere. The food was what prevented a higher rating. It was \""okay\"" and that is typical for a bar. All in all, a fun place to go, though!"
0;Let's face it, these places are not free. If you feel like you deserve to live in a place that is properly cleaned and maintained you will have to place a lot of work orders. Most apartments have managers who make sure the place is clean and well maintained. This is not one of those places. Filth and chipped paint is everywhere. There is no excuse. A 20 second slop a mop does not cut it.
4;This bar is in the Blair house suites hotel which was just remodeled, and they added this place just about 6-9 months ago. I must say that I did not expect much from this place, but the bartenders, food, and the video poker where all awesome, and all the flat screens weren't bad. Drinks were strong, food absolutely amazing!
1;Came by here again on a slow weeknight hoping for a better experience. While the food was better this time around, they were once again missing several menu items and the service was still extremely rude, slow, and inattentive. Sad to learn that these problems are systemic and were not just the result of the Restaurant Week crowds. I won't be giving them a third chance.
4;King of night clubs Is the best to book events. The owner Joe always made\nSure my group and I had a great time. He's very informative, oranized and helpful with everything. His parties are always a blast!!! Joanne
0;We went to rescue a baby kitten and was turned down because I didn't want them contacting a landlord due to fees . I think it's sad they turned it down and when my bf said he would keep it at his house they still said no because they didn't want the kitten at my house . SO we had to find a kitten another way. Sad they say to rescue fur babies but we couldn't our kids were sad leaving this place instead of happy .
2;Okay so yes Mike and Tony's has arguably the best Gyro in the Burgh, but the love affair for me ends there.  Oh and just a gyro is less than $5.00 dollars which makes for a very affordable lunch.  The downtown location is gross, there was bum piss in the door way. It should be some ones job to wash away the bum piss before they open their doors for business. The mural on the wall is very outdated and looks cheesy and the plaster is chipping away inside.  If anything just take your gyro to go.\n\nI have never eaten anything besides a gyro from Mike and Tonys but my boyfriend likes the grilled chicken salads.
1;We haven't been here in a long while.  Not impressed, most of the food is cold. Crab legs have no taste or just taste gross. \nTerriyaki chicken was dry as was the sweet &sour chicken, pork ribs too fatty. \nNot coming back.
0;I agree with Kristen.    I was there with my girlfriend, who is a bridesmaid in my sisters wedding, and the owner was very condesending about an issue my girlfriend had.   While it wasn't a big issue, we were talked down to and made to feel like idiots.    I recommend going any other shop where they will be happy to help you, and make you feel special for your special occassion, and you will not have any issues, glitches, or wrong dress sizes.
2;I will reiterate what many others have said. Food is above average. Service is poor. We've been there half a dozen times and besides waiting a long time for our food, they almost always forget something or bring us the wrong food. With better servers/server training, this place could be 4 stars easy.
2;"Conspicuously, I crossed the threshold.  The varnish of the oaken door was peeling, worn away, the brassen latch-pull tarnished.  \""A table for three,\"" I said.  \""The remainder of my party will be here directly.\""  The maitre'd condescended to fix upon me a stern look.  \""I'm sorry, sir.\""  She said, her bangs bobbed in front of me.  \""We cannot seat you until everyone who will be joining you is here.  Feel free to have a seat at the bar until they arrive.\""\n\nI glanced barward.  Smart suits and ties, polished oxfords.  Where was I?  I thought to myself.  What in God's name are these people on about? \n\nI sidled up akin a middle aged woman, her dried out blonde hair had given way to brunette roots, a sprinkle of grey visible from my proximity.  She sipped a cocktail of some kind, probably some kinda vodka.  I signaled to the barkeep, asked for a whiskey;  I had a gut ache from the night before and only the hair of the dog could combat it.  \""Seven fifty\"", the barman said sliding a curled slip of white paper my direction.  I fingered around my changepurse, pulling out a handful of all I could find.  \""This is robbery,\"" I said as I tossed the money his way.\n\nThe entryway bell jingled and I looked back hoping to see my companions.  No such luck.  An elderly couple dressed like they just come from a church service stood there, the woman's yellow scarf waving in the soft breeze.  I guessed my comrades weren't gonna make it.  Maybe they'd been caught?  Or worse.  I put the thought out of my head and my mind rested easy on the sack of loot on my back and the warm sixgun by my side. You know, a guy like me could add quite a few more greenbacks to today's haul in a place like this.  My hand fell to my side."
3;I joined Capital Fitness for two reasons: \n1. it is right downtown and easy to walk to, \n2. They have personal TVs attached to many of the cardio machines, making working out fly by. \n\nOther than that, the locker rooms are always clean and empty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, there is free parking underneath the building, and it never seems packed or empty. \n\nAdditionally, you can pay month-to-month, which was unique to Cap Fitness when I researched a few places in January 2009.
4;Wait, you passed it.  Turn around. OK, now where to park? Valet or the garage underneath the restaurant? Now that I've found a space where are the signs to get upstairs to the restaurant. \n\nOnce you get through finding the place, parking, going upstairs all the work will be worth it. \n\nThe sweet potato fries aren't fried, they taste better than the alternative and they're the reason I'm going to keep coming back. I started with the sweet potato avocado salad that had the perfect texture. The agave nectar soda is guilt free and so good. \n\nThe best thing is, even though I'm vegan, my friends who eat there love the burgers and the fact that everyone can get the best of both worlds. It's not just True Food Kitchen anymore.
4;"I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!"
3;Good food, good service and I didn't have to wait long for food. Will be back next time I am in the neighborhood.
0;"Horrible Valentines Day experience!! I booked a \""Celebrity Spa Suite\"" over 2 weeks before the day. We got there right at check in time (3:00pm) and waited 45 min JUST to get up to the counter! These lines weren't long by the way. I get up there to find out they don't have my room or \""any king beds in the whole hotel!\"" They offered me a \""Bungalow Queen\"" which is certainly a downgrade! It's Valentines Day I want a king! I was told its not a downgrade because it's still a suite. Pssh... That just means a couch in a sitting area apparently, and wonky lights.  Manager ended up giving us a food and beverage credit which we made sure to use ALL of! \n\nDon't make a reservation here... They might not have it when you get there!"
1;EH, for all the waiting, and all the heat, and all the hype, and all the expense....this really wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Honestly? The Frozen Hot Chocolate just sounds cool. Go to Starbucks (or somewhere else that's cheaper) and get a Frappaccino for half the price and half the wait. In my opinion, this place is WAAAAYYYY overrated.
2;Went to Ri Ra on the 3rd day they were open, during the soft opening.  There wasn't  a live band, so I can't say how it is when one is playing.  I like the layout of the place - the whole left side is one long bar and the whole right side is seating and booths.  Even though there was no band, it was pretty noisy and pub-like.\n\nThe food was just ok.  The boyfriend got the shepherd's pie and it was ok.  I tried the Kilbeggan Salmon and it was pretty delicious.  Appetizers were crab cakes and onion rings.  The crab cakes themselves were just alright, but the sauce that they put on them was awesome!  I really liked the onion rings - the were the tiny, thin cut onions and were super tasty.\n\nService was slow, but they were pretty busy and had only been open a couple of days, so I'll forgive it.  Our waiter (can't remember his name, but he was Irish) was super nice and chatty.  I'll definitely try this place again.
4;Beautiful poker room with plenty of money and action. It's got an open airy feel to it, very comfortable place to play. One of the top 3 places I go to play poker when I'm in town.
2;Expensive for what you're getting.  Food is good.
4;This was a great find, thanks to my friend & yelp! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you're looking for amazing quality and flavor and great service! I had the pork tenderloin, which I never get since it always comes out dry but this was cooked perfectly, med rare and so so much flavor. \n\nTry Mesa Grill, you won't regret it!
1;I always enjoy trying new styles of bbq, this is Chicago style bbq! Being from Texas you get used just one style TEXAS! The location is in a strip mall a decent but not very desirable area. When I first walked in the place had interesting decor from the bathroom doors being a Pepsi machine! The wait was a little long to order at the counter but I'm a patient man. I ordered up the brisket sand which basket came w one side and a pickle for about $10. Little over priced but it did come w a drink. The brisket was served w a little fat which I like and the sauce was good. The  potato salad tasted pre made from a tub. I'd recommend trying the place once but not sure I'll be back as there are certainly better bbq in phx.
1;Mediocre buffet with a good selection of desserts (except for the cheap tasting gelato).\n\nDespite the Wynn-fanciness, the ambiance still felt like a chinsy buffet.  \n\nMy work has better food.  I wouldn't do this place again.
0;I had lunch at this restaurant and ordered their specialty duck dish. The price was hefty so I expected to be at least decent. What I got was a piece of duck that was fried to a crisp. The meat tastes like jerky and hard as a rock. When I complained to the staff, the manager said that this is the way the duck is usually cooked at their restaurant and would not even bother to replace it for me. I had only eaten a bite! Even their staff member did not agree with the managers decision to do nothing. For 23.00 dish it was a waste! Don't bother with this establishment. It does not even deserve a 1 star!
1;"Would have loved to try this place. They were constantly closed on Sunday mornings, like at 9am...what bakery does that?!\n\""LUNCH SPECIAL\"" in their window...and they were closed.\nSo the wife and I gave up.\nNow its turning into a pizza shop (again), we'll see if they survive, this is the 3rd business it has been in 2 years"
2;This the second time I've eaten here. Both times the food was good. The blues band that was there was really good. I also liked the 1/2 price drinks.\n\nThe first time the service was good. The second time we came for lunch and they only had a bartender doing drinks and waiting tables. She was not overly friendly and seemed to take a long time since there were only two tables.\n\nI would recommend giving this place a try. Maybe for dinner not lunch.
3;"If you have a Platinum Amex you get to go in for \""free\"" (or the annual cost of the platinum card which more than covers the cost of your 1 buffet meal in the Centurion lounge). The chairs are comfortable and the food is fine. The lounge gets crowded so once you find a seat, you should probably stay. Haven't been to other Centurion lounges but hopefully they are all like this one."
2;"Pretty fun themed casino like out of Camelot, but with all the modern amenities. This I would say is one of the easier hotels to get lost in though as far as Vegas goes. Unlike many other hotels in Vegas though, I'm not a fan of many of their dining options. The Beware of the \""body snatchers\"" prevalent at this property who REALLY press you for the time share sell. While dated, it's still a fun place to kill a few hours."
4;Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\n\nOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
0;Went here with the family for NYE dinner.  Food was half good and half horrible.  Kitchen closed and sent home all of the chefs (except the pastry chef) before we even had the plates delivered.  They should never have taken the reservation for a party of 14 at the end of the night.  They were running 40 mins behind and still seated us, but only to poorly execute the food and service. They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are. I live in NYC and have no problem paying higher prices for good food, but having to pay high prices for crappy food is just ridiculous.  Very disappointed and will never go back!
0;I moved here about a month ago and it has been the worst apartments I lived in two bad I sign a year lease. With in the first weak or so we started to see roaches n they fumigated then next weak we seen them again plus we started to get bit by bed bugs wich are not in our Matress but in the bathroom which of course were stuck with paying 150$ for the fumigation of them. They tell you the apartment is cable ready is not one aux cable wrks the cable guy said all the other ones look nice with there covers but some there in between the walls the cable is chopped so is not cable ready. My rent is 735$ but after allocated water service 44.88 allocated sewer service 25.07local sales tax14.80allocated trash service3.70monthly service charge5.03and new account fee10$ it adds up to my new rent been 838.48 big difference this apartments are not recommended take it from me I live here till my lease is up 11 more months
3;"Our last several hours spent in Vegas were dedicated to visiting Margaritaville for both a good meal and drinks. We were also expecting to be able to get our hands on the tall, long margarita cups that we assumed were sold here, but we were disappointed to find out that we were at the wrong place for this. Nonetheless, it did not prevent us from having our final meal in Vegas.\n\nUpon arrival, we noticed a handful of people waiting to be seated and hoped that it wouldn't be a long wait as our flight departed in a couple hours. Luckily, from the time we requested a table to actually being seated, it was no more than 15 minutes. Our server assisted us within 5 minutes of being seated and took our drink orders. There were a variety of drinks to choose from; I ordered the Big Rita on the rocks and also was interested in the Mango Frozen margarita. Both were excellent and brought to us 5 minutes after ordering them. We didn't order appetizers but it was really amazing seeing what the Volcano nachos looked like at the table next to ours. One word describes them: humongous! As for our food, we ordered burgers, quesadillas, and a chicken burger, all of which came with fries. The food was much better than expected and delicious. The burger was full of flavor and went perfectly with my drink. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the portions were generous and the overall quality excellent.  The prices are reasonable with the drinks always being expensive as with the rest of Vegas."
3;I really like rubios. It tastes great and seems fresh.
0;Just terrible, I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill, nope I got pan fried, flavorless garbage. The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa. Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces. I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else. Bad food, bad service, way to loud, why is there no negative star rating? This place gets negative two stars. If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility. Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining.
1;This popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings.\nLocated in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.\nThe restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.\nWe ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.\nIn seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.\nViva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa.
0;I went to this establishment on November 20th, 2012.  I walk in and nobody is standing at the cash register to greet me and ask me for my order.  I had to ask the lady to get somebody to take my order. After I gave my order I waited for 5 minutes and nobody started making my wrap.  Then when I got my wrap it was freezing cold (spicy chick wrap).  It was absolutely disgusting.  And it was close to $8.  Do not go here.  Bad service/Bad food.  Also, the boy making my wrap would not stop staring and laughing at me.  How awkward and unprofessional.
1;Not a bad place, service was good. Price seemed a bit high for what it was, I had the gyro pita which only had 4 slices of gyro meat on it. Pita bread was delicious. \n\nParking can be a bit chaotic, but they have an attendant to help guide you and manage the flow. Inside feels a bit cramped for me, but it also seems like they do a decent carry out business.
4;Happiness is a warm bagel.\n\nOwen's claim to fame is their bagel steaming process.  Before I came here, I had no idea what bagel steaming entailed, but it beats the heck out of toasting.  Bagels (and bagel sandwiches) go in the steamer as regular bagels.  A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. \n\nI ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.\n\nThe wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.\n\nPerhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.  But if you can talk your server into popping a cookie into the steamer, it comes out chewey and melty like it was fresh from the oven.\n\nOwen's bagel shop might be a little tough to find, but the bagels make it worth seeking out.
1;Dawn P is on the right track\n\nService is great!\n\nAs for the food...\n\nWe tried the carnivore pizza - just a notch above frozen pizza\n\nIced tea tastes like water, and the bar tender agreed, but could not fix the mix. She graciously offered an alternative.\n\n\nWe will give em another try in a month or to.
1;"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.\n\nLet me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.\n\nI ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\n\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\n\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\n\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\n\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\n\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\n\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left."
0;You pay a fee to get in. You pick your own parts then they charge you gold prices for used steel. I wanted 2 brackets & the price started at a rediculous $75. I bawked & the price dropped 2 more times. I still ended up paying way too much for sum lousy brackets. I inquired about some other parts I wanted and for a couple bucks more I should just buy brand new with a warranty. Crazy huh!!!
3;I'm giving them a star bump because the last time I went the service was a lot more attentive for the afternoon tea. They even didn't charge us the upcharge for sharing pots of tea! This may have been an oversight but I didn't mind not paying extra to try the different teas.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the most busy place, and I'm curious to see if they stay in business for long since both times I went I was close to the only party in the restaurant. We'll see, and I wish them the best!
0;Worse show I have ever seen. The fact she was lip syncing was absolutely disappointing. There was a huge crowd and good vibe but the show overall was bad. My wife and I left and gave our tickets to a couple in the last row. Britney danced as if she was hurt....wait, did I write dance? more like she walked around while her dancers did all the dancing. So, no singing, no dancing, bad outfits well...it sucked.\nSorry Britney. I thought I was a fan till I saw you live. One more, thing please ask Planet Hollywood to upgrade your sound system. Not the worse thing you have done in Las Vegas but a close second.
2;"I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.\n\nThe restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.\n\nI was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \""Chicago\"" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.\n\nLike other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.\n\nOur server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance."
1;Thought we would give this place a try in our new neighborhood. Started with spring rolls that were uneatable-the meat tasted rancid and was an off color. Our entrees (beef filet pieces & rice) was just okay. The rice was my favorite part of the whole meal, but it's kind of hard to mess up steamed rice. My partner had the mixed grill (beef, chicken, shrimp) stir fry noodles. It was okay other than very fishy-tasting shrimp. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress standing behind the counter wiping & picking her nose with her hand and not washing them after!!
4;This is a hidden gem for sure!  Everything from the service, atmosphere, food innovation and taste, home run!  The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)
0;I would not return to this restaurant. First off you start your dining experience with 6 menus, and they aren't even nice, well thought out menus, they are printed on computer paper, stapled and dirty. They do not have descriptions of their rolls or drinks and it is unnecessary and confusing to have that many menus. Their prices seem reasonable until you realize how small the portions are. The taste wasn't bad but after a $50 tab, my guest and I left unsatisfied and still hungry. They have a $5 tapas menu which I tried the bacon wrapped dates off of. There were only 5 dates which tasted amazing but again, the portion was ridiculous. The same thing with the rolls, the caterpillar had great flavor but there were 8 slices of the smallest roll I've ever had and it cost $13. To top it off, service was extremely slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy and my guest and I had to help a fellow customer in a wheelchair maneuver around their tiny restaurant. There are too many fantastic sushi places in the area to waste your time on this one.
0;Sorry PAM (owner) but your place was terrible!!! My daughter had a so called cheese omelet (tiny tiny tiny tiny), it looked like something I was served on an airplane. The omelet consisted of one egg, maybe just maybe two very small eggs, paper thin deli ham (2 slices) little bit of finely shredded cheese, no toast, and a small side of dried out potatoes BTW the omelet was served on a plastic plate. To add insult they charged $7.95 for this. I had a egg and bacon breakfast burrito again very small, it was OK. Having read some of the other reviews me thinks that they are a sham by friends and relatives. This place is the worst!!!!
0;I can't stand to be lied straight face from a bunch of grown up men!!! They think we are idiots... They all look so retarded!!! ! We as family used to like them, and one of the guys tried to treat us pretty good, but, now I would not recommend anyone to be taking advantage of like they have been doing to us. We were told that this exactly shop was on the news for a bad reputation and at first I couldn't believe it, but after leaving there today and open my car and see that the floor matt was dirty and all curl up after asking several times to make sure to put a protect paper or plastic so it will not dirt the carpet ... I'm pssssd and I can't stand them anymore.... I guess they don't need business anymore.... The dirty carpet it's not the worse part, the worse part is that they're a bunch of crooks and they look like pot heads and act like them too!!!! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!
2;A lot has changed at this place.   All new faces and a whole different food.  But honestly the taste of the food has fallen below my expectation.   \n\nThey had the best Hakka Noodles, Indian style chilli chicken, Gobi Manchurian and Goan shrimp.   But not anymore.   Even their special biriyani looks and tastes different.   \n\nI would give them one more chance before taking them off my favorite restaurants list.
4;"The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \""curry-like\"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back."
4;This store was great with great customer service! The employee recommended good phones and features and was very knowledgeable. I recommend this store to anyone!
4;i came here with my fiancee a little while back.. it's one of the more memorable places in all of scotland.. give yourself about 3-4 hours to full take in the entire experience.. and don't forget to get their early to avoid the lines..
0;"I created a Yelp account specifically to warn people of this place - that's how bad it was. Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day. Even though I live right next to it, this will definitely be my one and only experience with Toros Spanish Kitchen and Tapas."
4;"I went here for the first time on Friday night. Now, I do not drink beer, I hate beer BUT all of my friends drink it so I goto breweries for support. I was impressed with NMBC, the interior was awesome, I loved seeing the stills and the whole rear wall is doors that open to a patio that were open. Our waiter was kick ass and was the epitome of customer service. There was some great live music going on and it wasn't some horrible hipsters.\nNow, as I said, I do not drink beer so I had a coke. It took me awhile to read the menu to decide what to eat, everyone raved about the crab dip and said the chicken sandwich and burgers were not worth eating. I decoded to get the all-meat 7\"" pizza and damnit, that was a FANTASTIC choice. Though I do not drink beer, I will come back for the atmosphere and the pizza. I gave 5 stars for the pizza."
1;"I'm really sad I have to come back and udate my review.  We visited Island again last Friday and had a pretty bad experience.  The service was AWFUL.  We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.\n\nAs far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.\n\nOur waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \""Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\""  Lame.\n\nThere were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.  \n\nIt was very disappointing."
1;"Nice hotel, but beware if you suffer from hot flashes or you prefer a cold room!  The thermostats in their rooms are locked so they will not go below 68 degrees.  I have never come across this situation in all my years of traveling. Seriously, the hallway was cooler than my room! Don't get me wrong ... 68 is a fine and dandy temperature, but I happen to be dealing with pre-menopausal symptoms, including those delightful hot flashes. 68 was not going to cut it. \n\nI called the front desk and the phone rang about 37 times before I gave up and tried the operator.  I asked the operator for the \""secret phone line at the front desk that they actually pick up,\"" which she gave me and the indifferent clerk finally answered.  I asked for a fan in my room, but they do not provide those for guests.  What a big fat jip!  \n\nWe had to change our plans for the evening since we had to check out and scurry around Boulder Hwy looking for another room for the night, which ate up an hour of our party time.  GRRRRR!  Ended up at the Super 8 motel on Boulder Hwy, which is a bit of a dive, but at least their a/c puts out!"
0;It's really too bad that Yelp doesn't have a negative star rating because that's what I would give the this hotel.\n\nThere are three adjectives that I use to describe this facility are rude, inefficient, and arrogant (plus tacky and unclean!)\n\nOn July 3rd, our Auto Club travel agent made a reservation for us for August 17 through the 19th.  We put the lodging fees on our credit card--had a receipt showing both the payment and the reservation.\n\nOn August 17th, after driving over 600 miles through rain and lightning storms from Northern California, I went to the front desk to check in for our family.  The clerk looked at his computer and said our reservation had been cancelled on July 17th (and our credit had still be charged).  I was shocked and showed him my receipt and reservation document.  He went to talk to his manager (Matthew) who basically told me that he would do what he could but if his superior said no we would be out of luck (that meant that my wife, daughter, and myself, after paying and making reservations, would have no place to stay.) \n\nI became furious because we had paid, the hotel staff had listed the wrong date on the reservation, and rather showing compassion and concern, Matthew showed as much warmth as an iceberg in the Arctic.  When I reacted in anger, he said he wasn't going to do anything that would guarantee us a stay. We then were forced to go find another hotel to stay at for the evening (this at 11:15 pm on a Friday night).\n\nI wrote a letter to their CEO almost a month ago detailing what had happened and heard nothing back from him.\n\nWhen it comes to reliability, courtesy, and concern, THIS HOTEL IS NOT A HARD ROCK IT IS A SOFT PEBBLE.
4;Yummy!!! Oishi!!! \n\nLove this place. Its not pretentious and the food is good. I wish the restaurant was bigger so I don't have to wait in line so long! (As well, a bit bigger so I don't feel like a freaking elephant when I try to squeeze by to get a seat).\n\nI like their shrimp burger and their salmon tartar bowl (and their salmon salad for that matter) was extremely tasty.\n\nDon't go there with children. Not enough room!
4;"I love a good cocktail.  I mean, who doesn't?  This place provides just that.  The menu offers some excellent choices and, if you're open-minded, you can put yourself at \""The Mercy of the Bartender.\""  It a cocktail made of whatever they are feeling that day.  Now it was my first visit, so I just did a bourbon cocktail and MAN.  It was spectacular.  The ingredients blended beautifully and the bartender was really cool to boot.  Drinks average $9-$12, but they are worth every penny.\n\nThe ambiance is kind of sexy: just dim enough with lots of beautiful wood tones.  There is a tv, which I noticed they had on for the Pirates playoff run.  But as soon as the game was over, that tv went off I'm glad to report!  Now there were 2 tables I noticed that had damned near spotlights directly overhead.  Sit there if you're on a date with someone you're just not so sure you'd like to see again (or with friends, since no once cares about being sexy).  \n\nThis place is connected to Legume, so while I didn't eat here I am sure the food is amazing.  I have already raved about it to several friends and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back!"
0;"This complex used to be called Haven Luxury, but has been taken over by a new management group. When the new management group took over, these apartments went to hell. I have had nothing but issues with these people. They have lost 5 of my packages in the office. When asked about them, they say to contact UPS, FedEx, etc. When said carrier tells you they don't have them and that the package was left at the office, the office staff pretty much says, \""tough sh**\"". There priorities are not in the right place. I renewed my leading agreement 11 months ago. Before I renewed, we were promised a renovated gym and laundry facilities. They said they would be ready within 4 months. Guess what, 11 months later and they just opened up the gym. The staff, for the most part is OK. It's a 50/50 chance that you will get someone who is nice and not a stuck up snob. All in all, I would say look elsewhere for a place to live. The area is nice and I have never had an issue with the folks that live around me. The staff has ruined my experience."
4;Outatanding.   Lump crab cales were all crab.  Loves the oysters.  Had swordfish and tasted Sea Bass and all was perfectly done and presentation wonderful.  Just delicious
2;Good veggie option- except that they served me the soup with chicken so I had to send it back. Perhaps they thought that chicken must be vegetarian.. :)\nOtherwise the place had a little annoying smell - I'm very sensitive to smell - nobody else seems to have noticed it. Friend enjoyed their meals- no complaints, no big wows.
1;I had been told this Was am amazing place by a friend w wonderful service.  However when we got there the girl at register was most unfriendly.  She would not smile at all.  I tried making small talk and she was just very cold.  I finally had to ask her if she ever smiled. She was nicer after that. \n\nThe sandwich I had was very delicious. I probably wouldn't return due to service.  The cakes they sold,  chocolates and desserts looked very yummy.
1;There were many more positions than personnel to fill them.  We encountered an inexperienced clerk who tried to upsell us on everything imaginable.  If we hadn't been hip to the cons we'd have been totally ripped off by all the extra (unneeded) charges.  And yet, we got ripped off anyway by an outrageous fee imposed by Phoenix to pay for their new rental car palace.  Beware!  Rent off-site if you can.
0;"made the huge mistake of leaving money in the car... realized it a few minutes after I gave them the car but too late, 15.00 cars wash cost me 55.00... my fault I guess hope the slime balls have fun w my $$ but hey I have more and they don't so I win... also half ass job and NEVER get your vehicle \""detailed here!"
4;I've seen Alegria (in Philadelphia, PA) and was pleased to see the same high quality presentation and music in O. The high-divers, cross-divers, and the guy who was chillaxing while on fire were all amazing, as were the endless list of other performers that were there.\n\nO took it to the next level with their diving pool stage/setup. Watching folks swim synchronously and never come up for air (not from this side of the pool, that is), and watching folks slowly sink into the water without a care and not come back up was as mysterious as a Cirque du Soleil show can get.\n\nO kept my attention the entire time - recommended!
1;this place is just okay....their renovation from Aladdin to ph seems half assed. the place is definitely marketed/pushed onto the young. they have tons of stuff going for that crowd. they have peepshow starring holly madison....which i enjoyed very much! i was kind of pissed off when i made my original review (coming from their spa experience). I do have to say i did enjoy myself here, but wasn't impressed as the higher quality hotels i have stayed at. Though they get huge points for their buffet...it is definitely one of the best i have had! I doubt I would stay here again...especially since construction is going on through las vegas blvd and this place is in the heart of it. my sister (a local) went through hell to pick me up for lunch....so that definitely sucked. my hubby and i didn't drive anywhere for fear of the mess that awaits us outside. good points were the buffet we got comped for, the coupon book, and the free bottle of booze a night promo dealie they have ( i don't drink...but chose stuff for my sister and parents). the staff here is not so great here as well...the service is not comparable to other hotels and one experience with one hotel employee kind of annoyed me. in all....an ok hotel...but nothing great or grand....there are sooo many nicer places to stay than here. it was hilarious to see all the plastered people stumble about the casino with their free booze in tow. their buffet is a must try!!!
0;Long wait for food. Food arrived cold. Disorganized waitstaff. Nice patio but I can get that at home. Go to Firehouse Subs. It's just down the way...
2;it's fun to come here at 2 am when other asian restaurants nearby are closed. Food was so so, some hit, some missed. A bit loud with with club music they're playing in the background. The waitresses were very nice and friendly, if it wasn't for them, i would have giving 1 less star.
1;"So I decided to bring a friend here for his birthday last night. There were four of us. Three of us ordered the Kiki's Burger, the other got the spicy miso burger. All of the burgers had good flavor. The problem is with temperature, my wife ordered hers medium rare, as she always does, but one half of the burger looked as if it had barely even touched the grill. I know raw hamburger when I see it, it was raw. The server apologized and said she would show it to the boss. She then returned and said the boss responded that my wife needs to order medium next time. I have been in the restaurant business for a long time, that is not how you respond to a complaint. They sent a complimentary desert to apologize, fine. The server then dropped the check without the burger on it, I thought that was great, I didn't ask they just made it right...WRONG! After I put the money in the check book to pay, the server returned and said \""I'm sorry, she made me add the burger back on.\"" Needless to say, I will never visit this establishment again, they treat customers wrong and I would rather spend my money where it is appreciated. I will also stop recommending it to friends, which I used to do frequently. You lost a loyal customer Bachi Burger...nice going."
2;This restaurant has a few dishes which are vegan or can be made vegan. It has an emphasis on comfort-food type dishes, such as lentil stews with injera (a fluffy type of bread, similar to a soft South Indian dosa). I would go here if you're looking for something totally different from the usual South and East Asian vegan options in Madison.
0;I feel bad giving this location such a low rating because like everyone in the city I know almost one person at every coffee shop here. I understand the stress of this job, but I also understand what goes on behind the counter. My husband worked at Buffalo & Lake Mead for 5 years. \n\nMy problem with this location is this. \n1) Drive thru. I refuse to go to this drive thru anymore because they simply do not follow their own policy. Starbucks has a 3 minute per car policy. Ex, if there are two cars in line, the second car should be out of the drive thru in six minutes. This location, that does not happen. I have waited over 20 minutes.... 20 minutes with one car in front. I watch to see if they are just an obnoxious person who ordered way too many drinks through the drive thru but that was not the case. Then I ask at the window you know, what happened? whats the hold up? You're not busy... They just ignore the question take my money and send me off. \n\n2) They dont understand their computers. Like I said, I have never worked at starbucks. But I know the computer just from ordering and listening to people become trained on it. I know that there is an option for milk for extra (like in a chai) or for creamer. They ALWAYS first charge me for extra soy, even though its just CREAMER. There I have to sound like the ass correcting them, but thats almost a dollar extra. They then stop and THINK about what theyre doing and act like they are new at their jobs and never were taught that. (bullshit)\n\n3) My drink is always wrong. Now I dont want to sound like one of those stuck up valley girls in all this. But my drink is probably the most simple drink ever. A venti iced coffee, with 2 pumps of white moca and some soy creamer to top it off. \npump pump, coffee, ice, milk... not hard... A standard iced coffee comes with 6 pumps of whatever you order or the standard sweetener. Its disgustingly sweet and turns into McDonalds coffee thus why I specifically one ask for 2. I always repeat myself twice, and get a repeat from them so they understood me correctly.\n\nThey still fail. Somehow I really do not realize how. \n\nMost of the people working here are little teeny boppers still in high school. Which I did think was a good job for young kids, but not here. They're ruining this location. They need better training and to work harder and faster. They do not take their job seriously.\n\nThe manager however was very kind when speaking with her. She did compliment us 2 drinks, but I will not be spending money on this location anymore. Like I said, Lake Mead & Buffalo is where it is at. \n\nI'm done ranting now.
1;Stayed at this place for a convention and  it was the cheapest place i could find so i stayed here.  As soon as i walked in the lobby i realized that this place hasn't received a decent overall since the 70s.  Walk into the elevator to find the yellow carpet halfway up the wall.  Walked into the room and it was decently sized.  Turned on the air conditioning and it sounded like a 747 was taking off.  Eventually had to sleep with the window open cause street sounds were way quieter then the sound of that ac.  Its at the very end of the strip the only thing farther was stratosphere.  Its convenient if your going to the convention center cause its only like 20mins walk from there.
1;"My husband and I were visiting Vegas for a short weekend and we decided we wanted to get some form of a massage, but didn't want to pay strip prices. I decided to make an appointment at The Foot Spa after reading all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp. The place was pretty easy to find and only a few short miles from the strip. It's located in a primarily Korean shopping center. Cool. We called ahead and made an appointment. We arrived on time and were promptly escorted to our massage area. Now, I know what I was going to be expecting at a place like this as I frequent one similar in my hometown. Every thing started off great until my massage person came in. I am solely basing this review on my massage alone, my husband enjoyed his massage very much and even feel asleep and was snoring. I'm going to start off by saying that my massage person must have just broken up with her boyfriend or something because I was basically tapped and punched through out the whole massage. I asked her to be more gentle about half way through and that lasted for about a second. My whole \""massage\"" basically went like this...tap tap tap, knead knead knead, punch punch. It was truly un-enjoyable and almost unbearable at times...I would have tenderized a piece of meat more gently than the massage I was given. The guy at my nail salon gives a better FREE neck and shoulder massage for 10 minutes than this place. \""Sorely\"" disappointed. Pun intended."
1;I LOVE RH, as in LOVE. I was extremely excited to visit this location but unfortunately, my excitement quickly disappeared when I experienced the customer service. I asked for pricing on an outdoor model ( I had to wait 20 minutes to be helped), my question was answered quickly, when I proceeded to ask for pricing on three other pieces ( I knew were they were in the store and their characteristics), I was asked if I could be sent an email with the information.\n\nThe representative looked as if he was in a hurry and I was so disgusted with the way he replied and the lack of interest he had in me as a customer I just wanted to leave. I gave him my information, cell phone, and email, he said he would send it later that day.... I has been a week. \n\nI was planning on purchasing the pieces that day once I knew the final price but the representative assumed that after having waited so long to be helped, I could wait even longer for a reply.\n\nRH... your prices are not a crate and barrel or pottery barn or ikea for that matter.  I have gone to ikea to buy a 20 dollar lamp and have been treated 100 times better than when I wanted to buy a 3500 usd couch at your store.\n\nRH strives to continue to be a luxury brand and your design and quality is superb. Please, have your customer service be up to par with what you are selling.
3;Great attention!!! I'm not into expensive make up or much of facial painting, but had to buy a gift for a MAC Fan. The variety of colors adjust more the pale skin than mine. Anyway you can get to try and open all those pots and lip gloss tubes! Enjoy!
1;Disappointed!  From the Yelp rating and the looks of the place I thought it was a diamond in the rough.  This could be my neighborhood go-to pizza joint, I thought!  There were some questionable comments in the reviews but I thought maybe if I get the carryout, it is better than the slices served there?\n\nThe pizza was underwhelming.  Although the toppings were good, sauce and crust was ok, it was very much like a homemade copycat version of Tombstone pizza.  However, at 2.50 vs 18 per pie, might as well stock up on the frozen version.\n\nThe chicken wings were pretty soggy and had lots of thick skin on it.  If you like that kind of thing, go for it.  Me, I would rather not.\n\nI wish I could have liked it a little better, they seemed very nice and I like local businesses.  :/
1;Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place. \n\nI think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them).
4;"Living in Vegas you don't always seem to find the best of the best when it comes to people truly caring about the profession they've chosen.  This is certainly NOT the case when it comes to Willis from Joshua Ian Photography !!  I have used his services twice in the past and not only have I been thrilled with his expertise, but the photos that I received have impressed guests at my home when browsing through the \""family wall of fame !!\"" Willis is spiritually gifted !! It doesn't get any better than that !!  He has a true eye for photography and you will be pleasantly surprised when he can create scenarios for your special event that you've never thought of !!!  Whether it be a wedding, a special birthday, or, in my case, a surprise gift for a very special niece, Willis takes your occasion to a whole new level.  If you are looking for a photographer for ANY special event, look no further.  Willis from Joshua Ian Photography is truly the man for your special day !!!"
4;monday night jazz sessions have made the 'burg bearable!!  howie and the boys rock!!!  the guest musicians every week, some of pittsburgh's finest jazz musicians, never disappoint!!!!
0;I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers...
0;Tried to kick smoking, went to High Life to buy what I needed for vaping  Felt decent about the purchase, but not good about the experience.  After arriving home and looking at other local stores I noticed I overpaid, and was sold knock offs.  The first battery never held a charge and the charger I bought was defective as well.  I tested each product independently.  Upon trying to return the broken merchandise within 24 hours, they offered no return nor exchange.  All sales final.  Fine, I get it.  Fool me.  A company that can't even stand by the products they sell is a fraud, cause the products are junk.  Also the knock off equipment could have exploded and caused great harm to my home or person.  A cheap battery from an unregulated plant could overheat, explode in hand make me a lefty for life.  A defective charger could start a fire in my home and kill everyone nestled in their beds.  Go somewhere that cares about you, the community and proper business ethics.  I understand profit, and bottom line, but I dont support taking advantage of uninformed customers.  This is not a vent, just an event log so you can make an informed decision.  Dont believe me, fine, read the other reviews, everybody seems real happy with this establishment.
1;While the food was of great quality and the staff were friendly. I take off 3 stars for the following reasons: \n\n1. Staff member observed leaving huge pile of ice mess on the floor after finishing transferring ice from the ice maker to the soda fountain ice bin. Staff member didn't bother cleaning up after herself! (ya mommy don't work there with you.. clean up your own mess!!). \n\n2. Buffet serving area didn't appear to been recently cleaned. Utensils felt sticky to the hand and floors not recently mopped (floors felt sticky as well.. including the restrooms). \n\n3. Been there 2 separate times and each time had to ask for silverware so I could eat my food! (make it a habit to bring the silverware out with the bowl or something!!).
0;I am a longtime shopper at buffalo exchange and I must say, this location is terrible. Staff is unfriendly, selection is awful & they never seem to buy any of the quality clothing that I bring in. I am done shopping here, completely over it.
2;"I went with a buddy who swears by the cheesesteaks. I opted for a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and swiss. I will say I was impressed that they roast whole turkeys here for the sandwicehs, so no thin processed turkey on teh sandwich. I would prefer if they baked their own bread, but that's not a huge deal. I ordered the \""small\"" sandwich, that was stil huge! all in all, good turkey sandwich"
2;Pineapple Carrot Cake is very good here. Even after eating it two days later, it was still moist, not ruined with raisins (can't stand cooked raisins, eeewww), and the pineapple really finishes it. I always make my carrot cake with pineapple, so that will always win me over. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\n\nIf you stop for the BLT bloody mary on the way home, you can pick up a snack here for the drive. Plenty of desserts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=-aEM8ucFmzvvlVCt8RiaYw, but also sandwiches, scones, coffee, and even gelato! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=Kih_XQhOBdSVZe4ph3oHXQ
2;Most of the staff are friendly and helpful and the store offers a lot of different services, including key cutting, mailbox rentals, and photo-copying, though it is a very small shop.\n\nI have a mailbox here and fairly consistently get mail that's supposed to go to an adjacent box.  When I report it, they always say they'll ask the distributor to be more careful, but I can't say I've noticed much change.  I wonder how much mail of mine has gone to another box?\n\nThe main complaint I have relates to the cost of mail services.  GASP!!  Holy crap!!!  Be prepared to pay a premium.  They are overpriced, as also noted by several other reviewers.\n\nTIP: For US Postal Service in the same shopping center, visit the Hallmark Store to the west.  They store itself has the worst service ever (see my review), but they have an in-store postal branch outlet...at least for now.  That may change when the USPS goes belly-up...
2;"With all of the talk about this place we had to go here while visiting Edinburgh from the US. As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \""benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \n\nWent there for lunch....results:\n\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \n\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\n\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\n\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\n\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\n\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding. Would go there again for dinner because this place is so special but with the hope of a better food experience.\n\nI"
4;Super Yummy, fast and very friendly service. Large portions, enough that we took some home and the kiddos ate it for lunch. My sons french toast was even good leftover
4;DA BOMB!
3;Well done! Had a delicious, full of flavor dinner and great customer service. We will be coming back
2;Decent.
0;I would have rather stayed at the super 8 motel than this place ever again. I stayed here 3 years ago ANC the room itself was dirty and there was a unidentified red streak in the wall that looked like blood. It never rains in Vegas but the one time it did was when we were staying here and it was the most rainfall recorded in years... The room 2 doors down's ceiling collapsed and the whole floor smelled like mildew. Not one person checked up on us or anything and when we said something about the smell the didn't move us or anything. I will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either.
3;I was FINALLY able to try the famous Burgatory here in Pittsburgh!\n\nSome of my first thoughts--very cool looking place! I love the walls and decorations they have around the joint. The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant.\n\nThe burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought.\n\nIs it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself!
2;I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. \n\nRandom musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. \n\nThe highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. \n\nFor where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.
4;There really isn't much more to say, because you can see how awesome this place is from my original review. Or from the reviews of others.\n\nI came in for the Yelp Eats UYE, and went to town by crushing some mad food.\n\nOn this particular night, I had the Yellowtail Sashimi, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, and for dessert, another appetizer....the Teeter Tots. Yes, two entrees, and an appetizer for dessert. It was that damn good.\n\nDon't waste time reading any more reviews. Just go. Nobuo. Now.
3;Oysters.  That's all there is to it, 15 deep fried oysters.  That is all I want, that is all I order.\n\nOf all the P* Fish and Chips, this breading is the thinnest... I was thinking it was all pre-fabbed, but now reading Jared A's review, perhaps the secret is hand breading!
3;Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.
4;Two words: HELLA GOOD. Wish we had one of these in Oregon! Visited in October while on a business trip. So glad we chose this place over the pho place a few doors down. Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.\n\nEverything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.\n\nTo top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!
4;French cooking with some interesting fusions going on, Passion8 is one of the best restaurants in the metro.  Fois Gras that is expertly made without being cloying or compromising, lamb and duck just as you'd find them on the Right Bank, and an impressive beer and wine list make this a great date night/business meeting location.
0;The selection here sucks. This one is pretty much just a kids store. The only items that were really offered to women were just a few tank tops, and some work out clothes. There was nothing cute. I generally don't shop here, but I went in one day to buy a few gifts for my cousins since they shop here often, and I was not impressed at all. The lines are very long too. I waited for a good chunk of time only to purchase a few items.
0;Upon entering Riazzi's, Kevin and I were unsure if we had stepped into an Italian restaurant or a nursing home. The patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated, and the place was dingy and dark. The only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing Rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts. Food was fine. Nothing to write home about. But the atmosphere, oh gosh. Never again.
1;2 stars is being generous. 1 star is for a great location in Old Montreal and the other star is because my wife likes their salt and pepper chicken wings.\nIt fails at being a sports bar. Sure they show a few games but they simultaneously pipe in Whitney Houston and Celine Dion greatest hits over the sound system.\nFood has no imagination, variety or taste.\nService and management are very weak.\nHave had several issues over the 5 times that I have been there with no satisfactory resolutions.\nWaste of a great location in Le Vieux Port!
1;Good food - straightforward, good fresh local ingredients, non chi-chi plates, and a very nice space in a great neighborhood. \nHOWEVER, after my 3rd visit, I decided that the food wasn't good enough to make me want to put up with the *abominable* service.  No more E2 for me: I've had enough of the waiters with attitude (one nice guy - none of the others were anything but extremely rude), hostess who makes it clear what an honor it is that she is paying any attention to you, and whomever answers the phone should be fired - she scares the customers away.
2;I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.  They still have great fresh bagels.
2;"A well themed resort with mediocre service.\n\n***ROOM***\nI was happy with our pool-view room in the Casino tower. Our standard room was pretty spacious (500 sq. ft.?) with a few noteworthy amenities: an iHome and a bed as fluffy as clouds. The room could have skipped out on the portrait of some rockstar, who kept freaking me out each time I caught a glimpse of it.\n\nWe booked the place with the intention to recuperate from our weekend at EDC. Instead, I felt like we were part of the Rehab party. We were fine with that too... it kept the party going. Even with our balcony door closed, we could still feel the vibration of the bass from the pool party. :)\n\n***SERVICE***\nBefore even entering our rooms, I had already received subpar service --\nMy hotel package came with a comp bottle of hard A + $40 food and drink credit. While checking in, the receptionist was ready to send me on my merry way with just the room keys, until I had to ask for my vouchers. Though he corrected the mistake, he seemed the least bit apologetic, and even judgmental, like I was freeloading off them... um no! just asking for what I paid! I would not even have to ask if I had received it in the first place!\n\nThe second day, we slept through \""Tidy Up\"" time, so I called Guest Services to replenish our tissues, amenities, and towels stock later that night. Housekeeping came 10 minutes later with towels, and a bag with two sets of amenities, but minus the soap. I never saw the box of tissues either D: I guess I'll be better prepared with my own amenities next time. \n\n***OVERALL*** \nGreat view of the pool and back of the strip, especially at night, but this is the last time I am booking a standard room here on my own free will. I would be open to staying at a HRH Tower Suite on a future visit. From pictures, the Suite looks similar to the ones at Vdara. \n\nNote: Stay away from this resort if you are looking for peace and quiet  in Vegas. :)"
1;I really liked the outdoor area and the view, but that's about it.  It was very odd walking though an office space to get there, and there's not much else around it once you get there.  I'm not sure if it's still considered uptown, but it's fairly close if you're okay with driving from center city.\n\nAnyway, It was pretty empty when we went and the decor was okay.  I'll likely visit again soon this summer to take advantage of the patio...but there are several other places I'll go to first.\n\nBTW...the drinks are pretty good...service was kinda bland tho :-/
4;I arranged my shuttle service via the Internet.  They were prompt, friendly, the van was clean and cool.  They helped me with my bag.  I enjoy the Super Shuttle and have used them several times.  Really enjoy setting up the pickup via the Internet.  I can pay for the trip and the tip, so I don't need to worry about money when I'm getting dropped off!  Convenient!
0;I was a long time and loyal customer after I moved to Vegas 2 1/2 years ago and I went to this restaurant numerous times until when I start seem HUGE cockroaches. First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here's again and the owner's attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me. \n\nI swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn't the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?\n\nIt's a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won't have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there's no SERVICE at all. The owner's attitude is even worth to hell. Don't get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what's called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He's taking for granted especially for a long term customer. \n\nNot only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going.\n\nI am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life.
0;I chose not to get a tattoo here after my experience during the consultation. I set up an appointment in advance but when I came to my appointment I was told the person was busy with another appointment. I waited until that appointment was over and then I met with the artist. I explained to her I wanted a tattoo on my right leg and she told me the leg would be too painful to do. I already had a tattoo on my left leg, so I did not see what the problem was? A leg tattoo has not hurt me any different from any of my other tattoos. It just seemed like the artist was trying to make excuses to not do my tattoo. In general, it seemed like the tattoo shop had 2 receptionists working and neither of them addressed me when I walked in or offered to help me in any way. I had to approach them to ask about my appointment and how much longer the wait would be, since obviously making an appointment did not seem to guarantee anyone would see me.But the ultimate reason I chose not to continue to work with the artist there, besides her telling me she couldn't do a tattoo on my leg, was because she suggested to me that I should get liposuction. She said it would be a better investment for me to pay for plastic surgery rather than get a tattoo and that I should consider losing some weight before I get any tattoos. I am an average sized person - I would not consider myself overweight and I was insulted she would tell me that I need to get liposuction before she would tattoo me. Customer service is not a priority at Club Tattoo. And my experience with this artist has made me not want to go to any Club Tattoo location for future work.
4;"First time to the Pizza Company while on a business trip on a Friday for the local Arms Gun show.\n\nHad a 12\"" margherita pizza and had them add a few mushrooms (small up-charge on price), as well.\n\nNoticed on the Yelp photos that the pizza were not \""burnt\""...so I knew to ask the staff to burn mine a bit.\n\nPizza is just not pizza unless you have some charring at the perimeter and the bottom of the crust.  It ads that burnt, smoked taste.\n\nThe crushed tomato sauce was excellent, fresh cheese and mushrooms are also excellent.  Basil is added the pizza comes out of the oven.\n\nPizza was great.  I did a take-out and walked the 2-3 minutes back to the nearby Hampton Inn.\n\nStaff was very friendly and wanted to make sure they did it right.  Before my pizza was boxed, they had me look it over.\n\nThe place is quaint, smallish..but they have enough seating for 20+ folks.  Clean and charming and quiet enough to have friends and be able to hear to talk.\n\nAlso got a piece of their tiramisu cake...which was also very, very good.  I let it come to room temp. before eating it.\n\nWhen back in Las Vegas, I will make the Pizza Co. my place for pizza cravings !"
2;"This was a funny place to end up on a night out with sixty (and then some) co-workers from our Amsterdam office. It was not beautiful but it was fun to go to with such a big group of different people. Very accessible, love the music. Ceiling's to low. Or maybe us dutchies are too tall. Either way; funny place! \u00a310 is a reasonable entrancw price (allthough we spent a sh*tload of money the night before, how about some discount next time?)"
3;I first want to start out by saying I love First Watch. I was always reluctant to try it but after the first time I met my soon to be mom in law there for lunch I was hooked. Before I seriously started watching my weight I would usually get the ham and cheese to the fifth degree and the tomato soup combo. *HOLY CHEESY FOODGASM IN MY MOUTH* it is to die for. Although it isn't printed on the menu anymore you can still ask for it and they will make it. Now when we go I order the Power Wrap (which is on the lighter side menu) I never knew egg whites, spinach, turkey, and Swiss cheese topped with salsa could be so damn good. Their mango iced tea is awesome as well. As for the establishment it's self it is always clean. The staff is typically pretty friendly and accommodating. I almost want to give them 5 stars but I do believe some improvements could be made to better some of their menu items. So I'll give it 4 stars... Yay! I'm a fan.
1;So I drive by this place a few times a week, and after seeing their cheesy commercials I've decided to give this place a try. I would not recommend their pizza at all. I had the California Pizza which includes your typical pizza veggies, and I have to say...NO FLAVOR at ALL!!! Even with added salt and pepper..no flavor!!! This was the first time coming here after being in AZ for 2 years...and will be my LAST!!!
4;"by far the BEST thai food i've ever had. it brings shame to any thai bbq and sanamluang locations. the food screams authenticity and different flavors associated with thai cooking - yes, there is more than lemon grass, coconut milk, and curry powder! there are levels of spiciness and the owner is a connoisseur of german white wines. he can match any dish with the right wine. how superb! just make sure you know what you are asking for when you ask for \""spicy\"". dinner is the best deal. for lunch, there is a buffet, however, it rids of the entire atmosphere. (if you want a buffet in vegas, eat at the rio!) there are tons and tons of items to try- all the more reason to come back. i think we ordered about 7-8 dishes and paid a little over 100, including tax and tip. we were only a party of 3! now that is good dining!\r\n\r\nthe location and the setting isnt what you would expect of the restuarant. it's off the strip (which is a good and bad thing), located in a plaza. just dont judge a book by its cover. come hungry and talk to the owner if he's there. he's a really nice guy!"
1;Same red/white colors as in-n-out however twice the price and half the flavor...very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of in-n-out.\n\nFor that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price.
3;I'm an out-of-towner, but when I'm in Squirrel Hill, I always make sure to stop here for a egg sandwich and a few bagels to go. The super cinnamon and the whole wheat are particularly lovely.
3;"Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  Decided to order the Club Sandwich w/Fries, $11.  He warned me that they don't mess around with their portion size....he was right.  This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.\n\nThe service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant \""working\"" lunch experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
3;Athenian Express has a HUGE selection of things to chose from. They have salads, burgers, gyros, pasta, subs, and pitas! There are also LOTS of vegetarian items.\nTheir hummus is out of this world. They make it fresh every morning and it comes with a generous helping of their pita that they get flown in from chicago because it's some of the best pita in the country.\nI've had lots of different things on their menu and I liked each and every thing I've tried. Sometimes their fries are a little over cooked and under salted but whatever, I don't go there for the fries.\nThe gyros are great, so are their pitas. My favorite pita is the chicken picado. The chicken is always very juicy and fresh and the grilled vegetables are well cooked and pair well with the chicken.\nI know they're also doing breakfast now, which I have had once. I don't remember what I got because it was some years ago, but I remember leaving satisfied and full.\n\nI think for the price and quality, you just can't beat Athenian express. For a year, I worked right next door to them. I would stop in almost every day and get lunch and talk with the owner and his wife. They are very friendly and funny, as is their staff. I always felt welcomed. Even with phones ringing off the hook and lines out the door, they always have a smile on their faces.\nI stop in maybe once every 3 months or so and the only thing that's changed since I worked next to them is that they've renovated and made the place bigger. Some people might not like that, but they generate way too much business and they really needed the extra seating area.\n\nI love Athenian Express, and their employees. It's a hidden gem that I'm glad I found.
3;Love Mongolian BBQ, Love this place.  Everything is always fresh and has the best varitey of any I have been to.  Would have given it 5 stars if they had the traditional sesame and other cool oils....
2;I think I need to go in during the mornings to see the best selection of cupcakes. The times I've come here have been toward the end of the day and they don't have much left. That being said, I did try their butterfinger cupcake and it was pretty good. There is more frosting than cupcake, and I'm not wild about globs of frosting, but if you're a frosting lover and a cake hater, you'll be stoked on the proportions.
2;Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel.  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay.  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.\n\nThe breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant.
3;Spinach salad is a must try.  Pad thai is good, not as good as Lotus of Siam.  Pad see ew tastes similar to Pin Kaow.  Really good thai iced tea.  Pricier than most thai restaurants.\n\nService is good and fast.  Decor is lovely.  I will probably go once in a while but since Pin Kaow is nearby, this will not be a regular place for me.
0;"Kitchen is great but watch out for the bar.  They only comp your drinks if you LOSE.  James Aguilar, (manager) NOT customer friendly, does NOT give a crap about locals.\nCame in here with my husband whom was gambling a little. Ate, played pool... ZERO beers comped.. We only hoped for one to be comped, but these guys were totally hard up.\nApparently PTs is hurtin for money if they won't comp ONE draft beer.\nNever going back.\nAlso put $5 in the juke box.\n\nWe are all around good patrons usually, but not used to the \""you don't lose enough here\"" motto.  Weird vibe. \nTake my advice... Go across the street to Eureka Casino.. Barry and Grace are so nice, and Fat Choy has a better menu."
0;another review for maybe a second chance to do good. i ordered the reuben sandwich for a late night craving. the meat was so thinly slices that the sandwich was just bland. best part of the meal, Susan. she was making sure that my meal was perfect but you can't blame her for the food being soso. total cost for the coffee and sandwich $19. are you kidding me.
2;RA seemed like a legit sushi restaurant while we were sitting in our hotel room, craving sushi. We opted to wait a bit and head over to catch their reverse happy hour (10 pm-close). The interior is nicely dimmed and has a cozy feeling. There was a good vibe in there and thank god it was not noisy and hectic. Getting away from the crazy loud Vegas life to enjoy a meal was refreshing.\n\nOrdered off the happy hour menu. Wasn't too impressed with what I saw on there so I figured I'll go with what I know and keep it decent. From what I saw around my table, rolls were slightly small, my rainbow roll was just okay. The albacore was probably the best dish I sampled. Honestly, nothing was too memorable for me and same goes for my friends.\n\nOn  a good note... service was phenomenal, even hooked me up with a sake on the house. BUT, their idea of a large sake, is weaaaaaakkk. That's a small ass bottle my friend. A quiet, chill, not too stuffed but sorta buzzed evening gives my experience at RA a solid 3 stars.
2;Been here a few times and can only rate it as OK. The service has always been good and the food on the mediocre side. The best I have had are the noodle dishes but if you are a sushi fan you will be let down. Sure, if you are looking to do some serious drinking and need some sushi to chase your saki then this is a fun place. But for serious sushi others in the valley are going to be worth the drive. Read Roka Akor.
2;Don Pedro's is a good spot.  Probably the best Mexican I've had in this little area so far.  Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise.
1;"I'm not rating the product, only the customer service level of the older gentleman (owner/worker) not sure of their status. I took my daughter since she wanted to see what they carried, since I boosted about this market. We were both very impressed and decided that this is where we will start purchasing most of our meats. However, the only thing that they do not carry, that my daughter loves are turkey chops. That will not be a problem. We didn't really make a purchase other than some cheese, that looked wonderful and I just had to try it. A little over $3 and I used my debit card. This gentleman with no personality, took my card that I handed to him. (Key words: \"" I handed ). Rang my total and place my card on the counter. (Dear Lord, that makes my blood boil, hair stand on the back of my neck, eyes bleed). You know what I'm talking about. Placed my receipt on the counter for my signature. Took the receipt, no eye contact, placed in the drawer and never said \""thank you\"" \""come again\"" \""hit the road\""...nothing! I am going to try them again. I can assure you when it comes to customer service, \""3 strikes, you're out\"", does not apply here. They will get one more chance. What's more annoying is that I have told several people about this market and each person has gone, made a purchase and loves the product. Maybe they should keep personality-less in the back and not have customer contact."
4;Great spot for the atmosphere, and absolutely fantastic coffee. The Food is wonderful. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;In the past I had tried another place to have some parts re-chromed. 6 weeks later, they hadn't even started the job, so I was willing to try Papago because of my horrible experience with the other spot. This was slightly better, but not by far. I am starting to realize that this type of business plays by it's own rules... Deadline is an unknown word, and on time is a foreign concept. Work was supposed to due on the 20th, and on the 2nd of the next month, I picked up the item the day they called and said it was ready. To boot, the item looked really crappy. The front office was filthy, like it hadn't been cleaned in... OK... Looked like it had never been cleaned. Ever. So, if anyone knows a place for re-chroming, that is reliable, on time, and does a good job, let me know. I'm not holding my breathe!
0;"Wow!  The worst bottle service experience of my life, in Vegas or otherwise.  Not at all what I expected from this place given all the hype.\n\nWe had a table reservation for a group of five guys and two girls with a $3000 minimum.  We arrived around midnight and were seated pretty promptly at a prime dance floor table, as we expected for the amount we paid on a regular Friday night.  \n\nThe table next to us was crowded with girls and only girls - most of them hot local girls.  They were drinking for free from the cheapest bottles and were clearly \""employed\"" by the club, whether they were actually paid or simply lured by free bottles.  This fact became even more evident when we ordered our champagne and vodka and the bottle waitress pointed over to the girls' table and told us that if we see any we like we should point them out and she would bring them over.  It's standard practice in Las Vegas for staff members to bring girls to tables, but I found taking it to this level quite hilarious; regardless, props to them if it works as a business model.\n\nA little later on in the night, after having chatted with one of the girls from the pro-clubber table, her group of friends was sent off (sold?) to another big spending table. I decided to take the waitress up on her earlier offer to send ladies over.  At this point, to reach our $3000 minimum, we had purchased several bottles of vodka and champagne, much of which was still on our table unopened.  I asked the waitress about sending some girls over, and she replied, in the rudest manner I've ever experienced at a nightclub, \""You're drinking Stoli.  Girls aren't attracted to Stoli.  You should order something else if you want girls to come to your table.\""\n\nLuckily, it wasn't tough to find girls (she was quite wrong about girls and their attraction to Stoli), but this level of attitude is hardly what I would expect from someone set to make a minimum $750 gratuity from serving a single table.  This would never happen at a true top-tier club. I'll stick to XS and Marquee from now on."
3;I've been here for lunch a couple times and decided to check out their happy hour.\n\nSitting in the bar area they offer a limited food menu at great prices.  We ordered the fries and chicken wings.  The fries came with three dipping sauces and all three were good.  The wings were meaty and seasoned very well.\n\nI enjoyed a Kiltlifter beer in the bottle.\n\nNext time I want to try one of their flatbread pizzas.
2;3.5 Stars\n\nThe food was better than okay and had me wanting to come back to explore their menu.  The corn beef hash took a minute but was definitely worth the wait.  \n\nWill definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.
0;Needed something cheap and quick to eat.. decided on this and it was a bad decision. It looks like Panda Express but tastes nothing compared to it. Had a funky sour taste. \n\nNot a fan.
0;"Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.\nI have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them, which has been about 3 years.  My internet will be slow for no reason atleast once a week, my cable will freeze and I will have to restart my box...which is annoying when you are trying to watch tv.\n\nAlso, they really have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I recieved a bill from them a YEAR AND HALF after the fact for 35 bucks.  The best part is, I do not even have time warner in my name anymore....when I asked why I got this bill so late, they told me that since I moved they no longer had a \""bill to\"" address.\n\nhmm, very odd that no other companies had any issues with sending mail to my new address.  Its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone? Would that have been so difficult? I dont think so.\n\nI called them up to discuss his and ask them these questions and the person I spoke to was dumbfounded.  Yea, I would be to.....because it makes NO SENSE TO BILL SOMEONE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THE BILL IS WHEN IT IS SENT TO THEM A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take to look into another internet/cable provider.  It is not worth the hassel or the headache."
0;"I went here for a coworker's birthday and was highly disappointed. The other reviews on the restaurant were great so my expectations were a little high. The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic with the spectacular views but the food and service left much to be desired. I work in the service industry so tend to be a little less critical but I was incredibly disappointed in Binions. \n\nWhile our group was sitting down, one member (who happened to be visiting from another country) stood next to the window to take pictures and our server hovered over our table trying to take drink orders. He was clearly annoyed because she wasn't paying attention and he had to wait. We were there around 8:30 and there were maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant so it's not like he was that busy...I don't quite understand why he didn't step away and give us a few minutes to settle in before taking drink orders.\n\nNow on to the food...I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for the steak but the seafood was awful. I'm from Seattle so have a taste for good, fresh fish and this restaurant did not have it. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and when the plate was set down in front of me, the first thing I saw was two slabs of gray meat. I kid you not, it looked like liver. Unfortunately for me it tasted as bad as it looked: dry and bland. And the sauce they chose? Yeah...it did not compliment it at all. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but didn't hold a candle to The Keg's. \n\nMaybe it was an off night for Binion's but this was my first impression and with that being said, I'll never go back. The way I see it, they should treat every customer's experience like it's their first and \""wow\"" them so they'll come back. Unfortunately, I was not \""wow'd\"" and don't plan on visiting Binon's again."
0;Attended a wedding at Seville Golf and Country Club.  The Doubletree provided a shuttle to the event and also scheduled a pickup immediately following the event.  On our way the driver didn't provide professional customer service ( didn't help us out of the van).  At the conclusion the ride was over 2 hours late.  We had to call multiple times, very disappointed in the service.
4;This place is so good.  The food is wonderful, the employees all know me by name, the atmosphere is laid back.  I love to go for breakfast, where my grandson and I can enjoy the geese and the other wildlife on the lake, the atmosphere is very peaceful, allowing for a great place to take a bunch of friends and actually be able to hear each while we enjoy great meals, and their specials are always tasty.  My only dislike ever, was their pasta, and that's a personal sauce preference.
2;We arrived here for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was no wait to pay for the buffet but we waited about 40 minutes to be seated. That was somewhat frustrating as you could see empty tables in the dining room.\n\nThis place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies, but I don't know that it's the best buffet in Vegas. I would say it's on the same level as the Wynn and a step below Bacchanal.\n\nThe food isn't bad, but it could have been better. I wasn't able to fully satisfy my intense pig-out session, because personally, I didn't see that many foods that I wanted to reach for. They had all the basics like meats, pasta, dessert, etc but nothing too exciting.
4;I love this place!  The people that run this join are top notch!  When I visit Pittsburgh I love to go to the Cantina.  Yinz should get down on it.
4;Mandalay Bay is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I love it because they have my favorite room - the two bedroom X3 suite. I typically have a lot of girls in my group and that means we need more than one bathroom. The X3 has a king bed in one bedroom and two queen beds in another. Each large bedroom has a huge bedroom with two sinks. That's 4 sinks in the joint. This suite accommodates 6 girls very comfortably. Last trip, we had 8 ladies in the group so I booked the GR suite next door and it was a perfect for us to have the entire corner of the floor. \n\nI also love the pool area. I prefer a bungalow or a cabana, but the regular areas are great too. \n\nI used to live in Las Vegas and have a lot of friends that still live there. Mandalay Bay is conveniently located at the end of the strip by the airport and Town Square. My friends can easily pick me up without battling the entire length of the strip. \n\nI wish they had some nightlife. When is Rum Jungle going to be redone?
0;We have not been to native in quiet a long time.  We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.  The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.  The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.  They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.  I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!  If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion.
0;In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest. Unfortunately the playing area was just horrible.
4;If you're planning to do a dinner and show here in Vegas, then the KA and Craftsteak package is the way to go. ($175-$199 PP). Show tickets themselves are around $125-$150. \n\nCraftsteak was simply amazing. The stars speak for themselves. We had:\n\nAppetizers\nGrilled Quail\nRoasted Red Reppers\nMixed Lettuces\n\nEntrees\nHangar Steak (shared)- get it medium\nRoasted Chicken - juicy juicy juicy\nDiver Sea Scallops \n\nSides\nYukon Gold Potato Puree  - I didnt expect it to be so good. \nRoasted Shiitake Mushrooms - i usually dont eat these, but i gobbled them down. \nRoasted Asparagus\n\nDesserts\nMonkey Bread w/ice cream - very sweet\nCrumble Berry \nCheesecake w/ice cream\n\nYou get fresh warm bread with your meal. They have a wine special for $30. They give you 3 different wines, 1 for each entree. \n\nLike women walking out of a spa.....I felt pampered and fullfilled. The food made love to my mouth and spooned with my stomach. \n\nI'll be back!
3;Solid 4 stars!\n\nIs nice to get away from the strip if you're there for an entire week!!! The ambiance here is great! Very calm and the service is great. \n\nThey are so high tech! The waiter took our orders with his iphone and it was submitted into the kitchen! He said the owner created an app. Genius!  \n\nYou can never go wrong with Tikka Masala!! We came here for dinner with a party of five. No buffet--a la carte. \n\nWe ordered an assortment of dishes, but my favorite was the tikka masala with garlic naan. \n\nI also ordered the peach lassi, which was pretty good. It tasted like a peach yoplait! hahaha\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, but they have a GREAT, extensive selection of alcoholic beverages!!!
4;"I'm solely basing this review on the foundation of this establishment, \""the cheese pizza\"".  This cheese pizza by far has to be the best tasting cheese pizza I've come across. The combination of their sauce, the spices and ingredaments in the cheese gives this pizza a MOUTHFULL of flavor with every bite. I wouldn't mind putting extra toppings to give it some more pizazz, but I think it would take away from its' flavorful awesomeness. I'm actually waiting to go pick a cheese pizza up with 50 wings. Cripes I'm hungra... \n\n5 STARS ON THE CHEESE PIZZA YO!!! GREAT SUCCESS!!!\n\nUpdate: I just finished my portion of the pizza. This place is ALWAYS ON POINT!!!\n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"
0;I ate here a hour ago. Feeling pretty sick hope its not food poisoning. Tried alot of the seafood. Not to impressed. The food didnt seem as warm as it should have. My fault for eating it I guess....would not recommend !!!!!
2;Have been there a couple of times. Food is good. Service is always slow. Last time we were there my husbands salad had an ant crawling around. I was very disappointed that no one came over to apologize nor did they offer to discount or comp it. Not cool.
4;"How could I forget to write a review about this place!?\n\nMe and my teammate stopped in for \""tapas style brunch\"" after a tournament.  For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.\n\nFood: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.\n\nThere were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.\n\nService: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.\n\nAtmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.  \n\nMaybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience."
1;I recently relocated from Houston where there is two Del friscos, one is the Eagle and the other grille I believe. I am a rewards member and know how and what to expect from the staff at a Del Friscos and my experience here was horrible. \n\nThe hostess was a gem and seated us anywhere we wanted that was available,  but the waiter Brent was a incompetent jackass. I immediately knew what appetizers I wanted and he asked if I wanted to see the prices on the menu first, lmao. I was thinking this was a joke. I had to call him over several times because he seemed to be distracted by the business men at the table over. He must've thought he would get more bang for his buck if he attended to them and not me and my date. \n\nThe food is and always will be great and Del friscos as a whole is amazing, but when I tried to escalate this to management and he advised I would receive a gift card in the mail. (Only to realize upon me checking the status of that he was let go from the company) . This has left a horrible taste in my mouth about the Phoenix. If in Houston please visit the one off of kirby, they will treat you like family.
1;Thank you for the friendly service! But the food was too sweet for me and never really did it for me. I'm willing to try it again, based on it's close location, but I will hope for a spicier experience.
1;I don't do dollar stores often, but I thought I'd head in to this one a couple of weeks back as I was in need of some Halloween candy and anything else that struck my fancy.  \n\nI wasn't impressed.\n\nThe store had a poor selection, but I managed to find about $30 worth of things to purchase.  It didn't seem very clean or organized either.  At check-out, the woman was not friendly at all and when I went to leave with my cart, I was stopped at the door by the big pole attached to the car.  (I guess the carts are only to be used inside the store and this stops them from leaving).\n\nI do not plan on returning to this store.\n\nIf you are interested in visiting a store for cheap / affordable items of all kinds, I think the 99 cent store may be a better option.  They carry produce and more food products also.  I'll be taking my dollars elsewhere moving forward.  Sorry dollar tree.
1;"Ick.\n\nIt was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a \""World Famous Gyro\"" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  \n\nUh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.\n\nGuess you get what you pay for...."
0;Came here last night & had the worst experience ever! I ordered the bbq wings & fat fries. When my food came out, my wings looked burnt. I ate one and they were horrible. I sent them back & continued to eat my fries. When finished, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen. I asked for a manager and he didn't seem concerned at all but I did feel out a report. I will never go back to this place. I'm not allergic to any foods so I knew it had to be this place. So enter at your own risk!
2;The food was excellent here.\nThe reason why I am giving this place 3 stars was the service. It was really over the top.\n\nWe were not treated very well by one of the staff members. He seemed really annoyed with us. I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.\n\nThe guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling. There were staff complaining about tips from other tables openly. \n\nImprove the personality of your staff and restaurant and perhaps we will go back some day.
2;"If you love M&Ms, this place is your Mecca.  If you don't, it will bore you to tears.\n\nI happen to fall in the latter category (yeah, I know, I know -- but M&Ms really *don't* do it for me).  The first time I was in Vegas, I just came in to see the panoply of M&M colors you won't find elsewhere.  And on that count, I wasn't disappointed.  You won't be, either: the candy wall is definitely a sight to see and the reason I give them three stars.\n\nThis visit we went in because it was so darn hot out and M&Ms' doors were open, blasting cool, conditioned air at us when we oozed by.  So I figured I'd pop over to see what was new in the M&Ms rainbow.  The so-called \""Vampire\"" mix with gray, black, white, and red candies made me giggle.  \n\nSome of the merchandise is cute, I suppose, if you lust after the melt-in-your-mouth-not-in-your-hand candies.  Whatever you can think of, they've put the M&Ms logo on it.  But who buys the sequined M&Ms purses???"
3;Cheesy Tater Tots...need I say more? The Vig offers a handful of different delish food items to choose from. They are expanding and just opened up a new location in McCormick Ranch that offers a late night menu. However, at their Uptown location my favorite drink on their signature cocktail menu is Take Bethany Home. It's refreshing and not overpowering, the perfect combination of ingredients. I highly recommend visiting The Vig closest to you!
4;Gas is $.30 cheaper here than in San Diego! Got to love not paying over $4/gallon.
3;"I can't go bowling anywhere else...before midnight. \n\nSunday through Thursday, after midnight, each game is only $1.00! My hubby and I bowl regularly and once we discovered that bowling here was a buck after midnight, we made it a ritual to go at least once a week. Other than the fact that the lady who rings us up is kinda weird and doesn't listen to you, and you get stuck by either really annoying people or those \""young un's\"" on dates that have nowhere to go, so they go bowling and suck face after every frame,  the place is okay.\n\nI love that there's no smoking in the bowling area. That doesn't stop people from trying, but generally, it's nice to bowl without running the risk of developing emphysema. \n\nBowl after 1am and there are a few regulars, people on dates, some even bringing their kids and bowl while they entertain their dates at the bar (yes, this happens and it shocks me every time), and then the bar closes. \n\nBowl after 2am and you basically have the place to yourself...and the weird lady behind the counter who put the TV on behind her on and watched Criminal Minds or Law and Order SVU if it's on. \n\nBowl after 3am and you really are by yourself and the weird lady with no personality. Maybe a security guard or custodian. And by then, you are now bowling a 45 and need to go home. \n\nI love this place. But I REFUSE to give it a 5 because of the weird lady with no personality to never listens. We ask every single time, \""Can we have a lane far from everyone?\"" She says, \""Okay,\"" but never does it. \n\n**Plus its 8 minutes away from my house. 6 if I hit all the greens! :D"
2;Went with a large group of 8 for a business dinner.  The service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed to disappear at times and prolonged the dinner.  It was fine because we had a lot to discuss, but out out-of-town guest were probably tired from a long day of training so it would have been nice to make dinner a bit shorter.\n\nI ordered the penne rustica and it came to the table in a piping hot bowl.  It was nice the put a plate under it and I definitely devoured the whole thing.
3;It's been a while since I took part in the nightlife in Scottsdale, it's not my scene but I was invited to White House for a party so you know how that goes.\n\nI arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  The crowd was sparse but I didn't care because that meant that I would get my drinks quickly.  The d\u00e9cor was minimal, everything was white and it seemed very well lit for a nightclub... less chances of ending your night with coyote ugly at this establishment.   There wasn't a cover charge and the drinks were... well I can't say if they were pricey because they were being paid for, but I can attest to their deliciousness.   I never had to wait in line for the bathrooms which were seemingly clean and also provided a bathroom attendant to hand you a towel... no toiletries though.  The staff was great, really cute bartenders that like to flirt.  The DJ was also a charmer and introduced himself to me.  He was playing a so/so music which basically consisted of top 40.  I can't really blame him though, I think it's a pretty common recipe to try to get people on the floor, which, by the way, was lifeless at this point but that didn't stop me, I grabbed a friend and danced the night away.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to any other Scottsdale skeptics.
3;"Just an update for dairy-free folks. There was a miscommunication. When I asked if it was diary free, they said yes... referring to the batter. Unfortunately, they still dip everything in milk to make the batter stick. I don't know why they didn't think to mention this. Still great people, but you would think after countless times of me saying \""I'm dairy free, so no coleslaw\"" that they would think to mention that everything is dipped in milk! Still really nice people, though."
0;WARNING DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! Whatever you do stay away this place is back under the old management and it's terrible. Been shut down by the health department so many times!! Most of the stuff they serve is from restaurant depot and is not very good quality. Please save your time and money for all sushi restaurants sake. So sad the other owners didn't work out the food quality went way up now it's just crap like before.
2;It's a Vegas buffet what else can I say. It was $88.00 for two of us on Sunday night. I'm not a huge buffet fan but it was my partners first time in Vegas so we had to go to one. Would I go back? Well yes if they wanna comp me but no if I have to pay. Again, not saying it's bad just saying typical Vegas buffet. Everyone should try it once. I just feel for $88.00 I can get a better meal that's not a buffet.
3;"We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?\n\n   The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  \n\n   There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out."
2;"Known at my work as \""the man on the corner\"" the holyrood cafe is the main supplier of breakfast rolls for the work force. It's all pretty standard fare, and fairly standard price. The falafel wrap was surprisingly tasty though. I think I'd give this place 4 stars if they got a decent fridge for their soft drinks. Open fridges suck, frankly. They don't really cool down the drinks, and actually heat up the room their in. \n\nYou can sit in but there's nothing particular to write about in that regard. All in all pretty good but not quite great."
1;I dont mind coming here during the day, but I try to avoid coming here later in the evening. I just always have a bad feeling about this place and the kind of crowd that come around in the evenings. Price-wise, its just like every other walmart.
3;Another great Fox Concepts Restaurant...no surprise here!  The space is absolutely great - amazingly bright and open.  The service is extremely quick at lunch which is much appreciated.  And...the food was great!  My pasta was flavorful and just the right portion.  I am confident this place will be a huge success and imagine it is pretty hard to get a table at peak times.
0;"My parents had a 20 dollar off a 50 dollar purchase coupon and off we went.  Having just returned from Greece, maybe I'm being a food snob but this was not traditional Greek food.  My Mom seems to think they are under new ownership because she said the food was very different from the time before.\nWe enter an empty restaurant with fake and dried flower arrangements (a big pet peeve of mine).  We order Greek Salad and it is teeming with dressing and very little feta.  Our Kabobs reminded me of the Indian food I had the week before and accompanied with \""steamed\"" vegetables that look like the kind you buy from the frozen section of your local supermarket.  Pita is not fresh.  Portion size is good though due to the loads of basmati rice on the plate.  Decent amount of chicken for the money.  Service was attentive.  \nAn old Sting concert is blasting from the random flat screens located around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, while we were there we got caught in an unusual heavy rainstorm.  We were there long enough for the Sting concert to be over only for them to restart it and play it again.  I was trapped in my own personal hell!  Andes candies at the end wrapped up this \""Greek\"" experience."
1;Doesn't compare with the other Max's restaurants I have been to. Mid-week and the food tasted refrigerated and been in the freezer for weeks. Filipino food is meant to be very tasty and rich, not americanized and bland. Even my non-Filipino guests who have no idea how accurate the dishes should taste , were not impressed. Hope they listen to the feedbacks here , as I have been eating these dishes all my life and I know how good they should taste. Ambiance, location , parking and decor is great, but we came for great tasting food.
0;This place is straight garbage.  If you enjoy waiting in line to be thoroughly disappointed then go here.\n\nUnless you had the foresight and budget to drop the cash on a booth (not really worth it for the wife and I alone) your basic admission allows you to stand in a series of hallways with security guards constantly reminding you to keep walking.  This place is FILLED with red tape and security guards.  Not my idea of a good time no matter what celebrity they keep announcing is attendance over the sound system.  The dance floor is pretty lame too and is packed to the gills WAY beyond what is comfortable.\n\nCheck out some of the lesser hyped but more reasonable and fun clubs in Vegas- Studio 54 and Rok are good choices.
0;I am embarrassed to say how much I paid this company for nothing - thousands and thousands of dollars. Reports were terribly late, my reps cared nothing about me or my company and the customer service was abysmal. Additionally, they charged my company for 2 months of service after I cancelled, then acted like I was crazy when I very kindly & calmly asked them to remove the charges worth over $5000 - they acted like I was crazy. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone or any business. Shady and concerned only about THEIR bottom line, not the growth of YOUR business.
4;The burger was excellent. Ordered to go at the counter and it took under 10 minutes to get my food. Ill be back.
2;Not a bad place I just had to many bobas  for my liking. Otherwise the taste was a welcome change.
3;You have to be careful here and only order the Hawaiian food because they also offer Chinese food but they jacked up the price for that and you don't get as much as when you order Chinese food. I get the Loco Moco because it's huge and cheap
2;I thought I should write a review for this place because I got an extra chicken finger in my meal... (vegas luck?) and I also won money gambling that day...and it started off with that extra chicken finger!\n\nI ordered #2 which comes with 3 chicken fingers (but i got 4 and I saw it as a sign that I had good luck to gamble haha), fries, and their very buttery toast bread!\n\nFast food is usually not my thing with all that extra grease and oil, but Canes was pretty good with their special canes sauce that I dipped everything in. I think the chicken is just ok and their unsweetened icetea is pretty good. I mixed the unsweetened with 1/8 sweetened ice tea (otherwise it's just too sweet).  My favorite was definitely the bread though (I would exchange that over fries) :)
0;"This place is a joke. \nCame in with my sister and we told them exactly what we needed, she wanted a pedicure and I wanted a full set and polish change on my toes. \nThe guy told us as soon as she was done with the polish change, he would start my full set because we had to be out by a certain time. \nOnce my polish change is done, a new lady comes in and wants a manicure, so the guy takes her and leaves me waiting! Mind you, my sister has been soaking her feet now for the past 20 minutes. We ask them what their plan is for our nails and they tell us to just come back later. At this point we made it clear unless they did what they said they would do, we wouldn't be coming back. \nThe lady was laughing and apologizing, and then wants $10 for my polish change. Fine. So I pull up the 10% off coupon and she asks, \""you really want 10% off of 10$? That's only a dollar\"" of course I want to use it since I won't be back! \nI had $8 cash for a tip, and she rang me up at $9. So I gave her my credit card. \""Oh, you don't have cash? I can't run this, has to be a certain amount haha\"" \nThen the guy says it's company policy to have a charge be at least $15, but he'll run it for me today. Bullsh*t. I should've just left without paying. Avoid this place and their awful service!"
3;Best creamery in town! They currently hand out buy one get one free coupons (limited to waffle cones or waffle bowls) if you get a medium or large icecream. Not sure how long the deal will last, but it's definitely a steal, and it's great for friends/lovers to enjoy. Some of my favorite flavors include dark chocolate, butter pecan, and nutter fluff. So good!!
0;"Sadly I would of never thought I would be giving Olive Garden a 1 star. \n\nFound out that my favorite event at OG was going on and since we hadn't yet been into our neighborhood OG since it was new, it was a easy choice. We arrived and and were seated immediately by the front entrance.\n\n Nikki was our waitress and we placed our orders. I ordered the Asaigo garlic alfredo on angle hair pasta and the chicken noki soup. After the normal wait time our salads and soups were brought to the table. I kind of laughed as there was only about 1/4 inch of soup in my bowl. All broth and 1 piece of gnocchi. I started to eat it and about 5 minutes later Nikki stopped by to check on us. I asked for another bowl of soup, and she stated,\"" I don't know why your filling up on soup when you ordered the endless pasta.\"" Well, I was embarrassed and just told her I like the soup. She leaves and brings back another bowl of soup and it is once again only has about 1/4 of a inch of soup in it with no gnocchi  at all. Just the broth! I asked Nikki why this was and she said she had to scrap the bottom of the pan to get that much and that they were waiting on someone to bring them more.  Now I know this is just me, but the manager stops over with a big smile wanting to know how we are doing. I told him that I was put off by Miss Nikki and what she said to me. How awkward I felt. He said he would get to the bottom of it. Now out comes Nikki bringing me a full bowl of soup and asks me in a condescending voice, \""is that enough gnocchi ?\"" WTF!!! I didn't even ask for that bowl! Now while she is there someone else brings out our food. So I have my pasta in front of me and I don't even touch the soup. \n\nI am disappointed in my service. I really did not enjoy my dining experience because of this particular person. I would much rather drive the extra 5-6 miles down to Cheyenne Rd and go to that OG. Because for the 7 years I have been going there I have had excellent service.\n\nI won't be back anytime soon, as we are fans of Michoacan and they KNOW how to provide a good meal with great service,and it's basically in the same parking lot we will go there if we want to stay close to home."
3;I went on a weekday during Arizona Restaurant week.  The food was fantastic - classic food done really well (rack of lamb) or new twist on a familiar dish (sweet potato gnocchi with chorizo).  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  The wine flight was excellent.  The only subpar dish was the dessert  - prepared in individual servings resulted in the bread pudding becoming rather dry, however the flavors were quite nice.\nI can't wait to try their brunch.
1;Good service. Average food. Bad air conditioning to the point where it was steaming. Banana Nutella crepe had barely any Nutella, mostly just bananas and cream. The place has potential but they need to pick it up a notch.
0;Bouncers are assholes working with the cops to generate revenue.  Be careful if you go here.
1;Two of us came here for New Year Eve dinner.  We were sat in the lounge area for dinner.  Granted we were walk-in and the main dining area was full.  The food was good, but nothing too special.  It was expensive for what it was.  Given so many options in Vegas, I probably will not go back.
4;Very nice staff! It would be not only for the best chocolate to enjoy the shopping experience there.\n\nGodiva chocolate in my opinion is the best chocolate, but also one of the most expensive.
1;Overrated.\n\nIt's a good burger. Service and quality are great, but $30 for a [mediocre] burger, fries and a beer is ridiculous. Having a celebrity chef's name on this place doesn't mean that it's a great burger.  Add to the fact that he's known for his french and haute cuisine - means he shouldn't know that much about burgers.\n\nNot bad, but not worth the price.  Even for Vegas.\n\nI'll be running to the In-N-Out about a mile away instead.
1;What is the mgm anymore without its lions now they have put translucent cover over the entire lion habitat.  How retarded! !
3;This place has pretty good thai food. Been here a few times.\nWe ordered pad thai, mongolian beef, and pad see eww. The place is nicely decorated, and the waitress/waiter are friendly. First time, our pineapple fried rice took forever to come out. I think they forgot our orders.  But the last two times, the food came out in good time.
4;I have been to this establishment numerous times. I have tried their pizza compared to others and I keep going back. The crust is amazing, chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Just how I adore it. Their pizza with only mushrooms is my go to favorite. I also like the buffalo chicken.  I have not had a bad pie here. Joey and Victor are always in a good mood, kidding around, having fun. They like what they do. The atmosphere is always uplifting.  So I will continue to drive the 15 miles from my house to the Pizza Company to get my fix.
1;Prices on the main menu are outdated. Ordered an appetizer sampler (11.99 on menu) supreme nachos ($6.49) and 2 drinks. My receipt did not have the prices on it. I thought I heard $23 over the phone which sounded fair but it turned out to be $33. They should update their prices, but if they did, I probably would not have ordered in the first place.The nachos were good but the items in the sampler were unseasoned and bland.
2;"Hob Nobs is completely unrecognizable from the old Willo House... and you know what?  That's ok.  Let's be honest.  The Willo House coffee really wasn't very good, and the service was pretty lacking.  So I'm over it.\n\nOn to Hob Nob... it's a really lovely remodel, if a little slick and glossy.  I thought the coffee was very good.  I haven't been able to eat there yet, but the menu looks great, if a little pricey.  Pastry selection seemed a little small too, especially as coffee shop= guilt free decadent eating in my mind, so I want some outrageous and fatty desserts to choose from.\n\nLocal artwork on the walls, with some pieces that I really loved.  The tables each have a different SUPER cool picture of Phoenix.  Very nice service, and I believe they said they'd be offering 2 hours of free wi-fi if you are a paying customer.  \n\nI've been twice now, and I liked it ok... I just didn't LOVE it.  It took me forever to write this review, as I don't have anything bad to say about it at ALL, but for whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to rave about it.   It's not especially homey, somehow, even as nice as it looks.  I'll have no problem going back next time someone says \""hey let's go to Hob Nob's\"", but it's just not my first pick.  \n\nHere's hoping that they DO find the perfect crowd that does love them though, and I really hope they succeed."
4;I ate here before the Thursday night Art Walk on main street. The food was great and the ambiance was nice. MIchael at the bar introduced himself and was great in helping me.   I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to anyone.
3;I went here on a sunny spring day with my wife for lunch.  It has a cool modern atmosphere with direct views of the capitol from almost any seat.  The burger I had was good, but very messy.  I think the bun could have been slightly bigger.  I like the huge ceilings inside.  Overall a good option on the square that I will try again.  I think happy hour here could be a good idea especially with summer on the way and their big tap beer selection.
1;came to rhythm kitchen on a recommendation from a friend.  the warning sign went up pretty quick when the server recited the evening's special.  barramundi with coconut risotto and mango salsa.  is that Cajun?  thankfully I passed but one of my dining companions made the mistake of ordering it.  I tasted the fish and although it hadn't gone bad.....yet, it was well on its way.  I started with crab cakes.  not bad.  for dinner I had the jambalaya.  again not bad but I could have made it in my own kitchen and it would have been at least as good, if not substantially better.  we shared beignets and bread pudding for dessert.  never really had a beignet but I wasn't impressed.  give me a good sopapilla anytime.  the bread pudding was like the rest of the meal.
2;"Recently opened and already having won several local awards, Pink Olive claims to offer \""exceptional food, no exceptions\""; this is definitely the case.\n\nMy partner opted for the 'Bigger, Meatier Breakfast' (\u00a37.95), which was essentially a double-sized portion of the perfect scottish fry-up,  complete with haggis. There wasn't a single thing on the plate that wasn't cooked perfectly, although i don't think i would have been able to eat a whole plate!\n\nI went for the slightly healthier sunday morning option, of the soup of the day (\u00a33.95) and a grilled mackerel fillet on a bed of lemon-dressed salad (\u00a34.95). The soup was seasonal vegetable and pearl barley, and was much tastier and more flavoursome than any vegetable soup i've had before. It's true that the mackerel was slightly greasy, however this was off-set by the crisp lemon juice drizzled over the salad. \n\nI'd definitely recommend trying the homemade iced teas. We couldn't choose between lemon or peppermint, so got one of each and both were delicious. My partner said they were the best he's ever tasted outside Morocco.\n\nIn fact, my only criticism would be the issue of space... or lack of it. Too many tables crammed into too small a restaurant took something away from the relaxed, sunday morning atmosphere."
2;no offense but the waiter or the server should really need to learn that the rice and the curry should be placed into two different boxes to go!
4;Love this place.  The steak and flank with an over easy egg is the bomb!!  Plus they make great pot stickers!!
2;"While I get that it's a great bookstore, I don't understand why everyone thinks it's the best. More than once, they've not had newer books I was looking for (that should have been easy enough to find) and the staff seem elitist and stuffy, as if I'm not \""Green\"" enough to shop there, and were never around when I actually needed help.\nThis is a great place if you're into, for lack of a better word, Hippy things. But not the non-materialistic Hippy, more like the \""I have so much money that I don't need to buy mass produced things\"" Hippy.\nThe best part about this store is that they have a ton of events and seem to be really involved in the community. They also have a ton of unique and/or handmade gift items - a huge portion of the store is dedicated to this - but make sure to have a lot of disposable cash because it's all expensive.\nBesides events or out of sheer boredom, I wouldn't go out of my way to shop here."
2;I don't do clubs, but I liked Ghost Bar.  The people were friendly (meaning the boys were very friendly) and the view is really nice.
1;"Uh. I was SO looking forward to you, PH, after seeing you in so many movies...but alas, you disappointed! My sister and I go to Vegas once every couple of years. She lives in Baltimore, I live in Boston, so I meet her down in her neck of the woods and after Thanksgiving we get on a plane to Vegas, baby! We've stayed in many hotels here over the years. I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. \n\nFirst of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas. LOTS of dark wood panelling, and the main hotel is definitely beginning to look outdated despite renovations and the tower addition. Maybe my room would be different? Meh. Was it awful? No. Was it anything to write home about? No. It was clean (except the table..there was some type of residue...glass tables in a Vegas hotel room are just ASKING for trouble, if you know what I mean...I can't imagine the things housekeeping has to scrape off after a looonnggg night/morning of partying). My sister's friend met us and she was obviously is a room that had NOT been renovated. Ay yai yai....I would def have asked to move if I were here. Striped walls and a mattress that was lopsided. Looked 20 years too late.\n\nI'm not sure what it is, but even some of the hotels older than PH have a \""newer\"" feel to them. Something feels kind of grimy about PH...maybe it has to do with all the dark wood panelling, but I can't say I was impressed with anything :(\n\nI WILL say the location is EXCELLENT and very centralized to the strip- location wise you can't get much better. While I wouldn't *not* stay here if it was heavily discounted/ or someone else was paying for it, I would not stay here again. Just my opinion! Nothing wonderful, but nothing bad. It's Vegas, so you want it to be exciting, which a lot of the other hotels do a good job with."
1;"Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with \""I'll be right with you\"" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!"
1;This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.\n\nI hope to return soon and update my review ( :
2;This was our second time to Au Pied de Cochon, after having an excellent meal the first time. Unfortunately, this time around we were slightly less impressed...the meatloaf, which was one of the specials of the day, was very salty and the staff forgot that it was my boyfriend's birthday, even though I had made a special request when making the reservation and reminded our waiter during the meal.\n\nHaving said that, the food is generally quite tasty and the ambience is lively.  The staff is friendly and professional, but disappointing that they would forget a special occasion, since you would expect more from such a quality establishment.
1;I can give the food the second chance. However, I still find it unpleasant to be served by half-naked girls in the middle of the day. I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place
3;$20/person? The money goes to charity and in return you get to gorge yourself on cupcakes? Mmmmm....let me think....yes!\n\nWent to the Cupcake Love-In for the first time this year and enjoyed every sugary bite.\n\nTwo rooms full of different cupcake vendors, eager to serve you a sample of their sweet treats. I have no idea how many cupcakes I actually ate. I lost count after room 1. \n\nThe best cupcakes were the unusual ones. Sure there were great vanilla and chocolate but if you can put prosciutto and fig into a cupcake and make it work, you're the winner in my book (looking at you Bourbon Steak).\n\nThe only bummer was that a lot of places ran out really early! Event started at 11:00 and by 11:30 places were already out of some things. So we missed getting to try a few that sounded interesting. One place had one with avocado but they were out by the time I got there. :( The event was scheduled to go until 2. I feel bad for anyone that came after noon, really.\n\nBut a good venue, great cupcakes and a good cause. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday.
4;Great food , live music. Lots of fun
1;"Ok so this is a tough review for me to write, so let me start with the good. They have a special place in my heart for the work that they do. Now for the bad, I went in to donate some left over food and litter from my cat who I had to put down. This was an extremely emotional thing for me, I don't say that for sympathy but merely to add to the story and my experience. I walked in, clearly a bit distraught, I explained and received a perfunctory 'I'm sorry' followed by \""leave the stuff over there, and do you need a tax form?\"" No thank you, no, can we have your name, no, are you interested in donating money, no, would you be interested in volunteering. Those are all the freebees they get as I consult with businesses including 501C3s. I would be happy to consult with them and greatly reduce my fee because this is so near and dear to my heart. So if you are the executive director or a board member and you happen to read this, please contact me, you could be raising so much more money, and more importantly saving so many more lives."
3;The modern atmosphere is good for a date night or just hanging out with friends. This place has traditional sushi as well as very unique choices (as the name would suggest). My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey. I definitely think it's worth the price because it's a meal in itself. Also, they have a great $1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays. The menu is a little pricey though if you're not going on their $1 sushi nights.
4;I have had several meals there and was very pleased with their comfort foods  .  Deserts are huge portions and very good.  I have also used their catering service. No complaints
4;A valve on my sprinkler system went out, they came out and had it fixed within 30 minutes. Reasonably priced, I recommend and will use them again if the need arises.
0;"I have stayed in the Luxor many years ago and it was actually pretty nice. I knew the place had gotten old and only booked the room because I was in town for a convention at the MGM which is right across the street. I was prepared for the room to be average and not so nice so my low scores are not based on that. I wasnt expecting a 5 star stay, but what happened over the course of the week was disgusting and so wrong! \n\nFirst of all Ammenities: \n- Rooms are old and out dated\n - Furiture was scratched and broken in some places\n -Bedding was comparible to a motel six \n- NO WIFI! \n- No central A/C so the room doesnt get cold.\n\nok now lets move on to the real reason I will NEVER stay here and will warn everyone I know not to. My Macbook Laptop was stolen from my room while I was out all day. I left my room at 7:00am when I returned at 11pm the laptop was gone. I searched everywhere before calling to file a complaint. They sent up a security officer who had me fill out a voluntary statement.\n\n Once that was done I realized I had no way to charge my cell phone, because I was using the outlet on my laptop. I went to the front desk and asked for a manager. I explained to him that my laptop had been stolen from my room and I had just filled out a report, but that I have no way to charge my cell phone and was hoping the hotel could let me borrow one for the remainder of my stay. The manager was so rude!! He told me that I could go to security and see if they have a charger in lost and found, why would they give me someone elses property! I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied \"" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone.\"" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. \n\nI eventually found the security station. They told me they have a charger but I would have to plug it in and wait for it to charge! 6 hour wait and its 2 in the morning. I told her I have to get up at 5am and cannot wait, so she suggested I leave my phone there. WHAT! after my property was just stolen! I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. \n\nOn top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! \n\nThe next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager. While I was waiting for the manager the valet was telling my husband you better move your car or I'll make you move it. My husband replied to him trust me you dont want me to get out of this car..when the manager came to help me he told me that there is self parking around the back....WHY did the valet tell us that....loh yeah because he is trying to STEAL $100 from us!!! The manager did nothing and told us he has to side with his staff. \n\nAt the end of the day nothing was done about any of this. The manager we spoke to at check out was rude and unhelpful I asked them to refund the room and was actually asked why would we do that? was there anything you didnt get that was promised? WOW how about common customer service and all of my belongings with me during check out. \n\nAlso regarding my laptop I have called risk management over 10 times and no one has called me back. I finally got a hold of someone yesterday who told me the only person who used a key besides myself was the maid. They said she told them she didnt take it so the investigation is closed. \n\nThere are so many great places to stay in Vegas the Luxor is not one of them. I made sure the 16,000 people at my convention about what happened to me and I warn anyone reading this to spare themselves the same experience I had."
2;"I ate here alone, with Groupon.  I ordered a bowl $5.95 of creamy butternut squash soup, which was REALLY GOOD.   It was probably the best butternut squash soup I ever had.   I can tell there was lotsa butter in it, and cumin.  But there was not much soup on in the rather flat bowl.  It really made me wonder how much less soup they put in a \""cup\"" for $3.95, cos I think the \""bowl\"" is a cup of soup poured into a bowl.  I cannot believe that my bowl was more than a cup of soup.  \n\nAlso ordered $14.95 Meat Lovers pizza to make my bill at least $20.  All pizzas are the same size, which I measured with a ruler to be 11\"".   I won't come back to Humble Pie because I think it is expensive for the little portion that you get for the money.  I like \""value\"", which is not here at Humble Pie.   1/3 of the pizza is the crust, which has nothing on it, so the pizza is even smaller.   Taste is good tho.  \n\nI feel the best value for pizza is the House Special at Mellow Mushroom in Tempe.  $20.79 for 14\"" and loaded high and dense with ingredients, best of which is the applewood bacon. \n\nMy server, Jon, was very attentive and polite.   When I was amazed they had cloth napkins for greasy pizza, he brought he larger paper napkins, because I went over to the bar and got myself bar paper napkins.  He brought whatever I asked for, lemon wedges and Sweet and Low (I make my own lemonade), more water."
3;It's getting cooler in Vegas, and therefore, it is HOT POT SEASON!\n\nI dropped by here with two friends and we ended up sharing two hot pots, and three orders of skewers. Everything was really good. Each of the hot pots were loaded with various vegetables and mushrooms. They could have done with a bit more meat though. I felt that each of the hot pots had too less meat for the amount of soup/veggies inside. \n\nNext... What's hot pot without SAUCES!  Normally, I like to eat my hotpot with a sauce consisting of peanut butter, cilantro, green onions, sa cha (barbeque) sauce, and an egg. I was sad that they didn't have any peanut butter (instead, I used some sesame paste they had, it kind of did the job), and i had to pay an extra 50 cents for an egg.  Seeing as there was not much meat to begin with, I opted to not get the egg. :(\n\nWe had an order of each of the skewers (beef, beef tongue, and lamb). I really loved the beef tongue and the lamb skewers, but the regular beef skewer was just so-so.\n\nAll in all, this place is great for a nice warm meal at night, and I would definitely come back to try their other hot pots! =]
3;it's all about Sunday brunch mimosas, French toast, and a room full of desserts. This is my fave place to go in Vegas for breakfast type food. It is all tasty and reasonably priced compared to other Vegas buffets. I cannot wait to nurse my hangover at this place once again!
0;i wouldn't give this company another dime. Not only did they have the saddest selection of produce i have ever seen, but the customer service was a joke. \n\nI am all about eating organic and gluten free, and i'm always in search of a fun new health food for my family to try. I went into Whole Food so excited because it was like a health food Costco. I was never once greeted, and i literally got dirty looks from a few of the people stocking shelves. \n\nI felt horribly unwelcome and my shopping experience was uncomfortable to say the least. i ended up buying 3 things because i put most everything in my cart back, and i wanted nothing more than to just leave. I don't even like to drive by that store....\n\nI hope the managers of this store read this and consider a complete staff overview, because this is no way for any store to operate.
2;Basic and decent gym with good low price memberships. At night are the busier hours and harder time to get to weights. My only complaints are the hours of service and no wifi to play music! My phone service sucks by the treadmills and back of the building.
0;Geeze... Empty as can be and I still got crappy service. Well... I would prefer crappy over non existent which is what we got. I gave them another minute before I was just going to walk out ... Waitress finally came with 15 seconds to spare. Very very unacceptable. FYI still haven't got our water yet either. Avoid this place unless you want to leave by retirement age.
2;"Went here for lunch today. I've been driving past this place for a few years now, so was looking forward to finally trying it. It was good, nothing to write home about though. We had the lunch specials - I had the chicken enchilada with green sauce and rice and beans, my friend had the chicken tacos. Extremely small portions, wow. For $6 a meal, which ok is affordable, and true it's just \""lunch portions\"", I still was expecting more. The enchilada was the size of a tortilla roll-up, like really really small. The tacos were also three tiny lil guys, like maybe only 3 inches long. The taste was just alright too - I mean it was good, but again nothing that's going to make me go back again. \n\nThe service was good, the server was attentive and our drinks kept getting refilled.\n\nSo yea...good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe dinner is better."
2;Slow Boat to Greek Isles\nThere is no scent as stimulating to my appetite as that of garlic in the oven or on the range top. This is just what greeted us as we walked in one rainy evening about 5:30 just off the light rail line in Charlotte. The setting is lively and open with tables well-spaced and the staff is attractive and friendly. We got menus soon enough and drinks were ordered. My choice was a local IPA, sorry I have forgotten the name of the brewery. It was cloudy! Tasted all right and I assume that this is what the brewer had in mind but it was weird. Not sure I will ever get use to that. Appetizers followed with Tzatziki and Feta for all and they, especially the Tzatziki were good for sure. Then we waited and hour for our meal to come!!\n\nOur water was certainly a nice chap and perhaps new at his job but clearly needed some help on the management side of his work. Don't know what the holdup but it was obvious and no apologies. To top it off I think I chose wrong off the menu. My salt cod may have been frozen and packaged. I can't be sure but it was very ordinary. I ate it all of course buy my companion's veal shank or dolmades looked much better. Dinner took so long that we did not have a time for dessert which is a shame. The cart up front with samples looked delicious. I'm going to have to give this a 3 because of my meal and the service. I'd like to go back and try again, it's very reasonable and convenient to down town without being down town but, I don't know.
0;"Manager's attitude:\nFirst, with party of 25, mgr only wanted to give us 2 tables to fit 25 people. We requested 3 tables, first we got a big fat \""NO\"". When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said \""yes\"".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill\n\nSanitary issue: \nThis restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart! \n\nPissed poor services:\ndim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..\n\nOnly table who did the family style order got their food as their order.\n\nForever food:\nPork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing. \n\nOrdering:\nTry to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant \n\n\nBottom line:\n\nI HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO EAT HERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. SANITARY ISSUE, BAD SERVICES, FOREVER FOOD WILL NEVER SHOW UP FROM MENU,"
2;Sampled the hazelnut, tiramisu, pistachio gelato and decided NOT to get any. They were creamy buttery lacking flavor. The creme brulee was ok. My friends did like their sorbets. \nChocolate fountain was kind of cool. \nThere are better gelato places than this. I liked Sugar and Ice in Wynn Hotel.
1;Good times.  Great for St. Patty's!!  Get in early to grab yourself a table and start collecting the celebratory plastic cups.
0;"How Disappointing. A \""French Bakery\"" that makes awful croissants. One would think they would make the best ones in town. My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.)\nAlthough the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy...\nI did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen. \nNot worth the drive from Cornelius."
4;Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.
3;"Burgers have taken on a highfalutin, gourmet attitude, but there are still a few places that make just a regular hamburger, albeit some with hole-in-the-wall status. Open since 1965, The Original Wineburger in Phoenix hits high marks when it comes dive hangouts, but most of all, they make one killer burger.\n\nWalking into Wineburger, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place and time, and this is a good thing. Surrounded by wood paneling, Formica-topped tables and the glow of neon beer signs, the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Diners seat themselves in either the main bar area or the game area.\n\nA burger joint doesn't bring visions of healthy light snack and salads; let's face it, you're here to eat thick slabs of meat and fried accompaniments. So it's no surprise the menu is full of fried delights, like the tasty Mini Corn Dogs ($4.75), finger-sized corn dogs that were fresh and hot.\n\nI also enjoyed the Cheddar Pints ($5), battered cheese curds deep fried to a golden brown perfection, a Wisconsin favorite.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, the Original Wineburger's fanciest ingredient is a splash of sangria to help enhance the beef's natural flavor and juiciness. The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.\n\nThe Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one. The bacon I added to my burger provided a fair amount of porky smokiness.\n\nWhat's a tasty burger without a tasty beer? Complimenting the salty beefiness, Moose Drool Brown Ale ($3.50) was ice cold and had a sweet malty flavor. Surprisingly light for a brown ale, it was a pleasure drinking. While the Trout Slayer Filtered Wheat Beer ($3.50) was slightly bitter at first, it mellowed into a sweet smoothness that sort of reminded me of an apple.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, simplicity is king -- it's still just two pieces of bread and a ground meat patty."
0;"EXPENSSIVE FOR NOTHING! You have to realy wanna blow some $$ to be seet that you blow some $$$.\n\nMen $20 Women $10 to get in. To \""rent\"" a seat MINIMUM in food and drinks $100/chair!"
4;Tried Bouillabaisse for the first time at Oyster Bar this trip and it was amazing! It might be my go to dish from now on. \n\nAmazing oysters...so meaty and clean. We ended up making the trek twice! \n\nTip: There's almost no wait when you go around 3pm. Any later and a line starts to form.
0;My girl friend and I ate here for lunch one day and sat in the bar area, at a booth. They took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and then this bartender named Jonathon came over to take our orders. Jonathon was SO ANNOYING. He kept cracking jokes and offering appetizers, side salads, desserts... things we just weren't interested in ordering. He recommended a dish for me, I ended up not liking it and when he asked I told him I didn't care much for it, and he just shrugged and walked away. He seemed to ignore us for the rest of the meal. It was awkward and I won't go back simply bc I don't ever want to have Jonathon as my server.
4;Idk if they had seen a dirtier car than the one I just dropped off for a full detail. Curtis and Kevin teamed up and did an outstanding job couldn't b happier! Great customer service thanks again guys
0;Ill give that hotel 1 star or motel style ,no cufe in room  i asked Y ?they told me even belagio  hotel dont have ,are u comparing to that !!! Slow as speed internet , no buffet. Away from strip its not worth it
3;I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!
4;This is a great place for dine-in, delivery, or take-out Chinese food! The restaurant itself is clean, casual, and provides a comfortable environment to hang and eat for however long. The prices are reasonable and portions are generous.\n\nMy favorite is their Szechuan garlic chicken extra spicy with white rice. They provide plenty of meat so that you're not fishing through too many veggies to find it. The chicken fried rice is also good because it isn't too greasy. I'm normally not a big fan of fried rice but I enjoyed the one here. I also recommend their wonton soup... hearty and comes with quality wontons (not the yellow, Americanized kinds), and the broth isn't too salty like most other places.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful... (we all know this is not the case for most Chinese restaurants). They're also lenient with menu modifications so if you like your dish extra spicy or enjoy baby corn the way I do, they will not have a problem making these adjustments. :) Overall I definitely recommend this place for a meal that's quick, cheap, filling, and enjoyable.
3;BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.  \n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)
0;"Food probably gets 2 1/2 stars. The waffles and chicken was pretty good.  But nothing spectacular. \n\nMostly upset about being seated in the worst table in the restaurant even thought it was about 90% empty when we walked in. When we asked for a booth they said sorry that's for party of 5 or more. This was obviously a lie as they went ahead and seated two groups later with 4 people. And they were all white. Very disappointing.  What's even worse, we all had stomach \""problems\"" afterwards. All in all a horrible experience."
3;Enjoyed it a lot. Good crowd going on a Thursday night when I pulled in by chance - just walking by. Menu looked interesting. Casual but cozy atmosphere. Scored a decent table despite just walking in off the street with no reservation on a Thurs night and was seated quickly.\n\nStarted with a chicken soup of the day and then the Sznycel Mielony - tasty ground meat with mushroom sauce served along with some fried potatoes and what I can only guess was some cabbage? should have asked, but it was good.\n\nLimited wine menu by the glass but I found a Canadian Mission Hill cab from the Okanagan Valley that went nicely.
0;"I enjoy finding good \""hole-in- the-walls\"" and was out in Apache Junction on a Friday  evening a couple of weeks back and needed to find somewhere to eat. Turned to my faithful Yelp, but was let down this time around.  This is just a just a hole. Worst meal that I'v had in a very, very long time. \nRead a number of favorable reviews and went with the \""specialty of the house\"" -  fried chicken.  Yes, chicken was fried. Can't say much more. On a scale of 1 through 10, I would give them a 1. Chicken smelt a little ripe and they were the smallest chicken pieces I have seen coming out of a restaurant kitchen. \nThis place is a rural bar/saloon at best, and i think that it gets its faithful flowing from the  local folks as there is nothing else close by."
0;"I'm tempted to write a long review about how bad this company is, but I think I've already wasted enough time with them. AVOID\n\nSome highlights of my experience with \""Lydia\"":\n1. Realtor waited until the day I arrived in Vegas to tell me she refuses to show me the property I'm interested in unless I come to the office first to look at other properties. \n2. Realtor gave me the incorrect address for the office\n3. Realtor chastised me for being \""fixated\"" on one property\n4. Tried to talk to someone regarding investing in short term property rentals, no one in this office has heard of AirBNB, lol\n\nUnprofessional garbage. Nothing gets me more irritated than Agents who still think they are blowing your fucking mind by showing you properties on their computer, the same properties you have already seen on your computer days ago, because we live in the information age. Someone needs to put these old goats out to pasture. \n\nI already wasted my time, you shouldn't have to waste yours."
0;Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.  There will be numerous people with food in hand in line, yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks (slowing down the entire line).  I guess that 2nd register at the end is just for show.
1;"Just signed up and already to 3 strikes.\n\n#1-Some creeper stared at me while I swam laps in the pool and clipped his nails for a full 30 minutes.\n\n#2-Signed up for a trainer, showed up ready to go and found out they had \""lost\"" my appointment. No one apologized, acted like it was my fault, and just rescheduled me.\n\n#3-My husband reported that the men's toilet had pee all over it. Seriously, GROSS!\n\nSince I made the financial commitment and really want pool and yoga access- I'm going to try another location out. My husband on the other hand is ready to cancel and go back to Gold's."
0;"Hygienist said that it would cost an extra $90 to clean my teeth. I left and went back to my old dentists' office at Family Dentistry (next to Fry's) and they performed the cleaning with no extra charge. The hygienist was extra pushy and refused to do the standard cleaning. \n\nAlso I was having extreme pain in my gum and the dentist could not determine what was wrong; dentist wrote me a referral to go to an oral surgeion. Again I went to Family Dentistry and they found a laceration in my gum and prescribed me the appropriate medication - dentist there said there was no need to go to an oral surgeon.\n\nI had high hopes for this dental office but they fell WAY short of expectations. I DO NOT recommend this place."
2;"It lacks identity. Is it a mediocre Japanese restaurant? Or contempory american? It was well cooked, but it wasn't inspired. For example: my main course was Japanese grilled skirt steak with Shishito peppers. My side was truffle Mac and cheese. Did not pair well at all. . . beautiful place, But just \""Okay\"" food."
0;"We chose Hooters instead of Buffalo Wild Wings because we were with a friend who is from Ireland and had never been to a Hooters. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, when we were seated, there was less than 10 parties in the whole restaurant. We asked the server to send the manager over and he blamed the slowness on the kitchen getting slammed because there was an event nearby, but we had arrived before \""the kitchen was slammed\"". He said he would look at our checks and get back to us, he never returned to our table. Our server came back and asked if everything had been taken care of and we said the manager never came back, she finally was able to get our checks. The manager did give us a discount off of our check, but I was overall disappointed in the whole experience and felt bad for our visiting friend who's first impression of Hooters was terrible."
1;just got back from staying at the Bellagio Hotel for the first time.  All I can say is I was extremely disappointed especially for the price.  First we were put on a smoking floor without notification.  The room was out of date (no flat screen TV) and multiple fixture in the bathroom were falling off.  Turns out they were closing the floor right after we left for updating so they knew the room was not appropriate but still put us there for the weekend.  Finally, service at the front desk was grossly understaffed.  Checking out should not take 30 minutes. Overall would not go back. Better hotels in Vegas.
3;"When someone says \""buffet\"", usually the world of foodies dies a little inside, but I was surprised at how lovely this place was to eat. Me and my fiancee went here as part of a Groupon for a 2-course meal with rice/naan for 2 but after taking our seats the lady who I took to be either the owner of joint owner offered us the chance to try a little more and asked if we would like to take the buffet instead of the 2 courses. I thought I had went to heaven, as bad as the idea of a buffet is, I couldn't say no to unlimited Indian food.\n\nIf the manager is to be believed then everything in the restaurant is homemade, or at least made on the premises. The starters were delicious, the curries were magic, the naan breads were hot and soft and even the desert were lovely but not too sweet.\n\nThere is a part of me that feel reviewing a buffet is like reviewing a Tesco, but I was very surprised at how nice and intimate this place was. Service was great and the food was even better.\n\nAfter having a quick look at the a la carte, I will definitely be coming back to try that.\n\nI'm a self confessed buffet lover and no matter how many good restaurants I go to, I will never change in my need to get elbow deep in food once in a while."
1;Looks like no one else had my experience.. My mom walked out as miserable as I did, but the friend we took had a great experience. \n\nAs far as massages go, I've had 2: one here, and one at the Hale Koa in Hawaii. My massage at the Hale Koa was in a whole different ball park- like the most amazing experience ever. All the Wynn has are the amazing facilities. You can spend the whole day in there if you like. My actual massage was TERRIBLE. I had a nice enough African American man, and he pinched my skin and left me feeling bruised. This is super unusual for me, as I like my massages rough. It felt like he wasn't massaging muscle, just pinching skin and fat. I'm not a fat person, I was your typical 22 year old, size 7.. so it's not like he couldn't get to my muscles.
3;Good food, no parking problem. One of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas.
4;So happy that this place was around the corner from where I was staying this past week. I know that LA has a million coffee shops, but there was something special about GreaterThanCoffee! No pretentious baristas, just super friendly service! Never a line, either! The Toddy was delicious as were the bagels. If I lived in Phoenix, I would definitely come to this place every day. Super curious about Co-hoots, the connecting coworking space.
0;Discovered this place about a month ago and tonight was my 5th and LAST time ever going. Ordered pizza and wings. Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!\nNever have I been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life. This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and I, now I can guarantee I will never step foot in the House of Pizza ever again.
2;Idk, but I feel this place is more hype than legit. Curds were avg as was the burger I had. Not bad but not great. Idk if it is worth the wait.
1;The double double was ok, the fries was horrid. They was so bland with no taste and was not cooked all the way. The line was so long, our total wait from entering door to receiving order was approx 45 mins. While in line a group walks in with a ferret on a leash. Letting the nasty thing ponder the floor like they was in there own house.  It is very in appropriate to take a animal into a fast food place, and letting it ponder. There was a whole lot of disquisted people in line, more then one employee seen it and said nothing to them about having it in the restaraunt.
0;I don't know why I spent even a couple hours in this revamped casino hotel because I wasn't impressed from the start.\n\nThe dealers at the blackjack tables are dolled up ladies who circulate between dealing cards and go go dancing.  All fine and dandy if they weren't so rude!\n\nI also expected a lower table limit considering we were downtown and not on the strip.  Yes, it was a Saturday night but $10 minimums at all tables?!?  You can actually find casinos that are similar to this little hole for $3 minimums on the strip (you have to look hard, but they're there!).\n\nMaybe the rooms were nice but I didn't stay there.
1;We decided to order from here based on Yelp reviews.... Overall I wasn't too impressed.\n\nWe ordered a small Margarita, small deluxe, garlic knots and a small antipasto salad. We hoped it would be worth the $60 we spent, but the pizza was NOT as thin as we hoped. The garlic knots, we're very dough-y and shaped more like blobs. The antipasto salad was mixed greens with rolled luncheon meat---nothing more. \n\nWe'll keep searching...
1;Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. \n\nThe brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. \n\nSo here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. \n\nIt just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. \n\nNot sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch.
3;The first thing to know about Kennedy's, is that this is not just some reincarnation of the old Ed's that used to be the name of this place.  Kennedy's is a whole different bar with a whole different flavor, both inside and out.\n\nNo review about this place is legit unless it mentions the phenomenal patio/deck area in front of the bar as you walk up the front steps.  The patio is full of fans, tables, umbrellas and even mist for when its really hot outside.  \n\nThe inside, bar area can def be a bit cramped, especially during peak drinking nights such as the 4th of July. \n\nBartenders are always friendly and on point.  \n\nI have never eaten here, so I can't say too much about the food.\n\nThere is def a younger, relaxed, New York meets Southern Charm, laid-back vibe to this place.\n\nKennedy's has a Western New York feel which I love.  If you don't know about a trash/garbage plate?  Well, then there's nothing left to do, but step up to the plate come to Kennedy's and learn how we get down in the Rochester, NY!  Roc Boys in the Building Tonight!
0;Bad service today. Two registers open. One cashier taking multiple orders from one customer. The other cashier let someone cut in front of me then decided she was done waiting on customers. With a line out the door there was no manager around. I left without ordering.
3;Super kid friendly, for kids under about 7 years old.  The only bad thing is that in the summer time, it gets outrageously hot and there's no where to get A/C protection... but I suppose welcome to Phoenix in the summertime.
4;This is a really professional, friendly and comfortable place to learn and have fun.  We needed a refresher course before a big wedding, so we responded to an advertised package, liked what and how we were taught, and had no hesitation in signing up for more lessons.  We're almost ready for the wedding and now we're planning additional instruction for the next big event.  We've even joined in a few group lessons.  Our instructor makes the lessons fun, and there is just the right balance between technical and style instruction, understanding our level of competence, and keeping it light and encouraging.  We always look forward to the lessons.
1;on the 20th, someone mentioned on facebook that there were bad reviews on yelp. since then, there have been nothing but glowing 4 and 5 star reviews. think the owners got their friends to pump them up. I do. c'mon yelp. I was there. not impressed. menu is way too ambitious for a sports bar. some people may like that. I don't. overpriced and off the wall menu. maybe that's why they won't post it on their website. owners need to make up their minds. do they want to be a neighborhood sports bar like they claim, or do they want to be an upscale, overpriced, overrated bistro gastro pub in a neighborhood location. if I want to get ripped off I can go to the strip. i'm looking for a true neighborhood pub. hope they go in that direction.
3;Sushi for three!  \nI am terrible at ordering sushi. So my darling friend Jen took the lead. \nWe ended up with  2 appetizers - Dragon Balls and deep fried veg, and 40 pieces of sushi - not sure exactly what they were, but there were some California rolls, eel, salmon, cucumber, rice, seaweed wrap and a whole bunch of delicious things! \nPictures to follow! \n\nNice touch: they bring hot towels to your table! Service was attentive and prompt. \nThe restaurant is on a quiet street in Old Montreal, walking distance to a street, I don't remember the name...sawrrrry!\n\nFood was absolutely amazing! We couldn't finish the two plates between three of us. Next day left overs were amazing though!\n\nYum!
1;The highlight of my meal was the lemongrass iced tea... which wasn't even that superb to being with. I understand what Tottie is trying to do here, but the execution is just blah. My steamed pork egg roll was dry and more stuffed with lettuce than anything, the peanut sauce didn't even soften it up. The sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable. The 2nd star is for ambience, since it was pretty strategically lit and set up. I dunno, I wasn't really impressed and probably won't return again, but then again maybe Tottie's isn't my cup of tea.
3;Recently visited this place for lunch and was pretty satisfied with what The Arrogant Butcher had to offer. I have made it a point to try all of the Phoenix City Scape restaurants and become familiar with the lunch menus of these restaurants.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a graciously hip host who made us feel very welcomed. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool and the location is perfect for downtown lunch commuters. \n\nI had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my friend has the cobb salad. The turkey pastrami sandwich was really amazing and the lunch portions were satisfying enough. I am not a big turkey fan but I will be calling this one of my all time favorite sandwiches, the coleslaw that accompanies that sandwich adds much need texture and is also refreshing. The fresh parmesan fries were great as well.\n\nPlan on visiting this place during your lunch break if you have an hour or more. The place was not busy and it took around 25-30 minutes to receive a sandwich and a salad. This is the only reason why I did not rate a 5/5. \n\nBut overall great resaturant, good food, good prices, good ambience, good drinks, and great experience. Will visit again soon.
4;Love whole foods! The store has a great selection of fresh, healthy food. I always go in to get a kale salad. This store offers several different ready to go food departments that make it convenient for grabbing lunch, dinner or a snack. I recommend that everyone try whole foods. Don't let the prices scare you, you're paying for quality and its your body that you're fueling. Why not eat good and fresh!
1;First: Big ups to Yelp and giving me a 20% off food coupon on my phone after checking in at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9.  We were in a group of 10 so that was big savings.  Showed it to the waiter and he applied the discount no problemo.\n\nFood: Disappointing to say the least.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.  I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry. \n\nDrinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.\n\nService: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.  Our guy was spot on, full of energy, would sing along with the tracks in the background and give us descriptions of the dishes.  Now if only the descriptions could turn into taste, it would have been a better experience.
0;super small selection.  really.  go to Mandalay Bay instead.
2;The website has a $2 off coupon, so that makes a men's haircut 13 bucks, but you have to tip, so it comes out to $15 anyway. Nothing great about the haircut really. The girl who cut my hair was nice and we chatted during cut, but she was very young and inexperienced. Nothing got destroyed on my head. It was a middle of the road cut for a walk-in. Might be better if you were a regular and knew someone here that you trusted. Still, it was a very friendly place and a good one-time cut if you need one quickly (i had a 10 minute wait at 11am midweek)
4;I actually look forward to my visits!!!! No lie!  Amazing staff, very friendly and caring....almost like being at happy hour with friends without the alcohol.  Lol That's my only suggestion... Serve martinis with a cleaning.   My teeth always feel super clean after my visit.  Honest business people.  Best I have ever been to.
3;The music is too loud.\n\nSorry, had to get that out of the way. I've been to MTO twice during my lunch breaks from work since it is so nicely close to my place of employment. It is certainly a nice place, with a vibrant color scheme and fun TV screens that display cute sayings and funny pictures. \n\nFood is scrumptious and varies between fatty and healthy. You can find a mix of ingredients, interesting and quirky, while also on the menu, you have traditional items to please the crowds. \n\nLast time I was here I had the FAT ELVIS. I couldn't help myself, french toast with bacon, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, and nutella, served with maple syrup. COME ON, even if you don't want it, you have to be interested, right? It was a heaping portion, for $13 and I only ate half. The mix of flavors is decent, french toast was done right, fluffy, not mushy, nice char on the bread, but not over-powering. Bread used it perfect, big and much like Texas toast style. Fruits were fresh and helpful since the meal is so very filling. Peanut-butter and Nutella flavors go well with the banana, but not so much the bacon in my opinion. I would opt to have the bacon on the side. \n\nI've also had the Hen House wrap here, and I believe it's better than the Fat Elvis. Wrap was not mushy or dry. Lettuce was crispy and fresh. Chicken was grilled well and honestly, probably one of the better wraps I've had in my existence of eating wraps. And I don't regularly consume them. Coffee is also good and comes in a nice, large cup.\n\nBonus - they have PINK lemonade on their menu. Yes, I ordered it. Yes, it was good. \n\nOverall return factor very likely. Recommended for breakfast and lunch.
3;Deep fried goodness from the snack bar in the back of Mermaids!\n\nI don't go here to gamble or for the drinks. I go for the unhealthy snacks like the deep fried twinkies or oreos, or even the hot dogs. \n\nThe place isn't the newest or the nicest and in fact, this time around, some of the clientele seemed seedy but I wasn't there to make friends - I was there to eat! \n\nI didn't have one but the have hot dogs for a buck. Not too bad if you need something in your gut other than the booze you can get cheap at the bar or anywhere on Fremont Street.
1;"COLORED ONLY: Sat in what felt like the minority section of the patio which was the secluded darkened desolate corner area. This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not \""da harasho\"" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the \""minority section\"", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest). The only way this was rectified, was luckily for us a food runner named Tommy took the initiative and went into action and GOT US A SPACE HEATER. I'm glad he stepped up, otherwise we would have just gotten left in the cold. \n\nSo why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha). Of course, what should be said is that we were most likely just the recipients of bad service/management, but I throw it back to race and blame it on my  Filipino entourage.... Ok, all kidding aside, the moral of this story is that it's not necessarily race/discrimination, but sometimes its just crappy sub-par service whatever color you are."
4;I like yummy wine.  I like yummy beer.  I like yummy food.\n\nPretty hard to find a place that has all 3 out in the west valley of phoenix but here it is!
4;Wow I love this place! Got the best cut that I've gotten the entire time I've lived in Vegas. ASK FOR NAOMi. She is extremely professional with excellent technique . I know a good bit about cutting hair - for a guy she is too notch and very up to date in the latest styles. Included was shampoo twice, conditioner , paragon hand wax treatment and a facial scrub/massage. $42 plus tip. Setting an appointment through Yelp was a breeze. Don't waste time looking, trust me see Naomi!
3;Super yummy Roma pizza- glad I made the trip. Arugula salad a little underdressed, chopped salad was wonderful. Probably could have staffed up for a Saturday night but staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back.
2;I can't really give a polished review for this venue when I is be a runnin' late.\n\nI mean its spacious. The staffs nice. I could hear the show. Tall people should stand in the back. Didn't order any food maybe for the next show I will. Haven't really explored much of the venue itself...err...this review needs to be updated the next time I visit. Which will be soon so...yar... don't listen to me.\n\n3 stars.
0;Great for a car wash but oh my god on the up-sells when you get an oil change. Seriously they are so hard to deal with when they upsell you constantly. Windshield, detailing, fluids, filters..it goes on and on. It just really ruins it and I will just go to walmart where they won't hassle me non stop. Lost customer.
3;Well, it was a surprise!  Some reviews said that the food quality was very poor and such, quite a contrast actually.  \nThe food was good (chicken tikka, chicken curry, aloo tikki, aloo gobhi, chhole, dal makhani).  The dessert section had kheer (rice pudding) and gulab jamun.  The chicken curry was good and the naan was soft.  The aloo tikki was nothing special and I did not try the vegetarian items as I was full.  \nFor $9.62 including tax this was a good place.  They even had lassis and fountain drinks but I didn't try it.  They do take credit cards too so that helps travelers like me.  I'd have given it a 3.5 stars rather than a 4 but 4 it is!
0;Enrique.P\n\nAround mid February we adopted a small dog from spca, we were told that the dog was healthy with no problems? 2 days later we discovered that the dog was not Eating? She had teeth hanging from her upper jaw\nSpca told us that they will help with the $600 surgical cost over the phone. We took the dog back and we were told that we are not getting her back, they will conduct and investigation? And the adoption fee could go for the surgery cost? I Want my dog back!!! The rude lady behind the counter needs a little training in customer service and courtesy this is a service town not Salem......,
1;I used to go here regularly, but stopped... the kid who works at the front desk is a pain. He says there are appointments available, then says there aren't. I went in for my appointment, waited 30 minutes and then when I asked him what was going on he had an attitude, I don't mind waiting when I'm a walk in, but not when I've made an appt days before. The girls do a good job... if you can get in and they're not busy because they're great, they're busy because they only have two girls working the whole place.
2;Was aight... For Americanized Asian food.. I had the schezwan spicy beef noodle soup. My friend had the seafood noodle soup which she thought was ok too.  \n\nFor a restaurant in the Aria that's trying to cater to most of the asians who come to Vegas to gamble and party.. its an easy and quick alternative to getting a cab and going to the chinatown area of Las Vegas.\n\nThis is also one of the restaurants that is included in the list of comped restaurants in the Aria.
4;Yelp reviews led us to this breakfast spot today.  No exaggeration, this was our best meal in Las Vegas.  Incredibly friendly service, fantastic food.  Nothing to look at, but when you dig into the gooey cinnamon roll you won't be able to pay attention to anything but your taste buds.  Holy cow.\nEggs were fluffy and not greasy.  Pancakes were equally fluffy, and flavorful.  Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly.\nI'm grateful this place is not local to me.  If I lived within 50 miles of this place I'd gain 50 pounds in a week.\nOh, and did I mention all this - two entrees, two drinks and a cinnamon roll made by the Tasty Fairy herself- all for $22.  It was their valentines day special.\nTreat yourself.  Worth the car rental to get here.
1;I've been there only once but the place is actually pretty small and the crowd is pretty young (around 18-20). \n\nThe entrance fee seems rather high for the place.
1;I was there for a conference and I am a local. I didn't stay in the hotel but I was there for over 8 hours so I used the conference room and ate lunch there. The food selection was OK, but it is similar to other casino's. I ate at Metro Pizza. The reason for the low rating has to do with the conference room. The group didn't purchase a group wireless internet package so in order for us to get wifi, we had to purchase it on our own. Not usually a bad thing until I was told by their sales office that it is $24.95 for one hour and $80 for the day. Are you serious? My monthly high speed internet is only  $50 for the month. I was attending a conference and usually it is included or a nominal fee to get it, but $25 for one hour is ridiculous.  Stay away from them if you need wifi while on the premises. They do offer a basic wifi with the room but charge an additional $8 to get decent speeds. Caution if you need good wifi speeds.
0;"I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  \n\nHere are just a few things that I did not like: \n\n1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. \n\nThe bathroom was, in their own manager's words, \""disgusting.\""  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several \""clean\"" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). \n\nUntil this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was \""disgusting\"" and \""unacceptable.\"" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. \n\nI got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. \n\nLesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. \n\nThe housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. \n\n2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. \n\n3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western \""macho\"" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. \n\n4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi."
1;Service? Here? Yeah right.\nI was seated in the middle of the main walkway. I could have asked to sit somewhere but I was short on time and needed to eat before I got on my plane. It would be awhile before I could eat again.\nI sat there for about 10 minutes while I watched them go take orders from other customers that walked in before me...and I was in their path. \n\nOrdered a burrito. \nIt arrived.\nTasted like a bland version of a Chipotle burrito....and I am not a fan of Chipotle.\n\nI was charged twice for my drink. Probably would have paid and not given it a second thought until I saw it later, but at $3.50 a soda. It was VERY obvious.\n\nNext time I'll eat before I get through security or try another concourse.
2;Great service by an attentive staff. Selection seemed a bit thin since last time I was here although a great alternative to the high priced casino options.
2;Nice stadium.  Very clean but odd watching in a dome since the roof was closed when we were there (end of June and about 112 degrees outside). \nFood was only OK in my opinion, but there was a good variety.
4;Perfect stay. Desk staff, restaurant and spa staff are all amazing, really friendly, helpful and accommodating, and seem to genuinely want you to be happy. Delicious food at ZuZu. Pool scene is fun and happy, even in sweltering July heat. Complimentary Red Flower soap, lotion, bath gel, shampoo and conditioner are fantastic. Don't hesitate to book this place.
2;Five of us went to Bryan's for dinner.  The table agreed the brisket was by far the best thing any of us had.  It wasn't dry as one of the other reviewers mentioned, but it was incredibly tender.  The brisket is the only reason we gave it three stars.  \n\nI know barbecue can be pretty personal on preference but none of us liked the pulled pork at all.  We ended up throwing it away!  The beans were a bit spicy (which I liked others did not).  The coleslaw was average as was the chili.  I am told the ribs were also fine but not great, so really other than the brisket there wasn't much to rave about.
1;It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats.  A little over priced for what you get as far as quality.  All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third.
2;5 stars for the food. IT was absolutely amazing! The Sandbar had mac n cheese and it was utterly stellar!\n\nAs far as event organization....you had way too much open space and not enough shade. It was miserable outside. When I got my tickets I had planned to be there for 90% of the event. I ended up leaving after 3 hours, and that is after practically drowning myself to stay hydrated. Please plan shade better if you are going to have this event so close to summer next time.
0;"I'm only giving one star as I have no choice (that I can tell).\n\nHere's my story...\n\nYesterday we called to have food delivered.  After the experience I had, I wrote on their facebook wall.  \""They\"" wrote me back to ask if I had spoken to a manager about my experience.  This is my response back...\n\nYes I did but by that time, the csr Ryan had already upset me so bad, there was no going back. The guy was the rudest I've encountered yet. We are walking distance from the cutoff for delivery but was totally willing to drive up the street to Chandler Regional to pick up. He acted like he didn't want to do that but then said ok. Although he admitted he lives next to this hospital himself, he wanted me to give him the address for \""safety\"" reasons. So, I googled the hospital and gave him the address that was on the hospital website. He then argued that the address I had given him was not an address he had in his system from prior deliveries there... Kept putting me on hold (about 5 times) to check with his manager... I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \""you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\"". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me... He was rude! He was unprofessional. He was condesceding. I was willing to drive to freaken pick up the order although it's stupid not to drive one more block to deliver... Actually less than! I understand boundries which is why I was willing to compromise. I was in no way, form or fashion rude or even demanding with this jerk... Until, of course, he wouldn't shup up long enough to hear me... THE CUSTOMER! The manager who came to the phone was just as condescending. \""I will talk to Ryan...\"". No she won't! She was feeding him the information and he was speaking it to me, THE CUSTOMER, with her right there as there was no delay in him hanging up and her picking up. This behavior is so much more than unacceptable. We had had an awesome day as a family and was winding down and decided we'd order from there. His unprofessionislm and rudeness **** near ruined my night which in turned caused my family upset. I expect and will accept nothing less than professionislm when dealing with a company where I am a paying customer!\n\nNot only will I ever call them or eat there again, I will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this location, at the very least!\n\nAnd, of course, they haven't responded..."
3;Went here for 2 days with a groupon.  The hotel is very easy to find, just off the freeway.  It  is very clean, modern looking.  We had a 2 queen room.  It was very clean, the bedding was so soft and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was very clean, new fixtures great water pressure.  The pool was a lot of fun.  They have an indian restaurant there but we did not go there.  The breakfast was the only sour note.  Only eggs, toast juice and coffee.  Anyway, I would definitely stay here again.  It used to be a Ramada, but recently remodeled.  I loved that it was very modern looking and so clean.  The front desk personnel were very pleasant.
4;"I love the hot tri colored chips, taco Tuesday! Karaoke Thursday, Happy Hour from 3-6 and brunch on Sunday! Killer homeade margarita and my new favorite bartender, Vincanto, \""Vinny\"" made up the best Dulce de Leche martini. We loved the mahi mahi tacos, the carnitas and the guacamole! The place is so comfy, swanky, and very welcoming. I'm so happy that it's right across the street from home. Sorry Lindo!!!! Chinita's wins!!!"
1;Big rooms. Needs updating. Carpets were stained and torn in places.  Smelled a little musty. Pool overlooks an ally and dirty street. Room service slow. And they don't respond for hours if u need anything.  Service could have been better for the amount of money you pay. Overall an ok place to stay. But it's Vegas!!  There are hundreds of hotels to choose from. Why settle for less!
4;Definitely worth a visit!  I had the salted butter and nutella combo...wow it was good. I had never had butter ice-cream before and now I will seek it out.
2;I'm not much of a golfer. In fact, I downright don't like the sport. But I've been to Callaway a few times to hit balls. For that purpose, Callaway is A-OK. The prices seem reasonable for a bucket or three. They even have a special right now (not sure how long it is intended to last) that gets you unlimited golf and range balls for $19. Now, I know my coworkers have experienced issues with the unlimited golf deal, but for the driving range, it sounds like a pretty good deal to me (especially if you somehow, magically share said range balls with friends).
4;Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.\nOf course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.\nI had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!!\nThey come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.\n1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing.\nNow onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...\nOne word: YUMMY!!!!!\nGo get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.\nI also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!\nLOL\nIts a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes.\nOh..service was also fantastic!
0;"Why oh why did I go to Chinatown in Montreal!? My instincts said stick to French restaurants and places in Old Montreal, but nooooo, I had to come here. \n\nFirst off, after we were seated, it took the waiter about 30 minutes just to come over and take our drink order. That alone should have been our cue to get up and leave.The place wasn't too busy, so that was no excuse for the terrible service. After taking our order, it took them over an hour to bring out our food (I really wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not). We watched as large groups of Chinese people were seated and served before our food came out; it was absolutely ridiculous how they treated us. When we finally did get our food, it was fairly bland and tasteless. I don't think I've ever been so angry in a restaurant (I usually have great experiences since I started relying on yelp reviews) and I want to warn every person that they should avoid this place at all costs; there are too many great places in Montreal for you to waste your time and money here."
4;We have used AZ concept for our Solar  Hot water and solar system.\n  I have read these reviews and what people forget about is that there are many company's out there selling solar.\n The utility companies are backed up three months or more. When ours was finally installed about 3months ,which we were advised of by solar concept. SR said they were sorry but it takes this long right now. After everything passed that day SR advised would be a minimum of 3wk before it would be turned on, was about 31/2wk This was of no fault of AZ CONCEPTS. They have been great to work with, when I had questions, they answered them for me.\n We are very happy with the SOLAR HEATER AND SOLAR on our home.   The installers that put the solar heater and the panels on our roof were very kind and courteous. You don't see that in workers today
1;If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.\n\nIn terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point.
4;"For the first time, I am giving a fast food spot 5 stars. Why?? Because they exceed expectations every single time. \nHands down best customer service of any fast food place, every staff member is super helpful and polite. Also ending everything with \""it's my pleasure.\"" Now I am sure they are trained to say it, but it also seems like they genuinely mean it. \nHow many other fast food places come around to your table if you are dining in, and ask if you need refills on your drinks. None that I can think of, except for something like Showmars, which I categorize slightly differently that your \""typical fast food'.\nFood is always hot and fresh, I have never had an order messed up, can't say that about any other fast food.\n\nSo the moral of this review is, in a fast food world, this is a 5 star experience. 5 stars like a steakhouse downtown, maybe not, but they have earned their 5 fast food stars for sure. \n\nThanks Chick-Fil-A!!\n\nNow you just have to open on Sundays!!! lol"
1;Came here cause it was part of a package deal...They gave us free champagne...free is never good. Def not Dom :(((  \nWe got there early on a Friday night around 11:30 pm.  The girls drink for free at the bar...sky vodka only...but its free again.  The music is mixed house and hip hop.  Crowd is older 30-40 is mainly the crowd.  I couldn't wait to leave and go to XS!!
2;Je m'attendais a mieux pour un resto indien dans le vieux Montr\u00e9al, les plats \u00e9taient excellents mais pour le reste j'explique. Le service \u00e0 table \u00e9tait bon par contre on a du attendre un bon 30 minutes avant d'avoir nos entr\u00e9es. Je ne le conseille pas pour un d\u00eener rapide en semaine. \nC\u00f4t\u00e9 propret\u00e9 c'est pas tr\u00e8s fort non plus, \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e il y avait de la poussi\u00e8re tomb\u00e9e du plafond et du mur directement sur la table. Je donnera 2.5 sur 5 car malgr\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9gatifs, la nourriture \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne.
0;"No stars-zero!The glass company M&M damaged my windshield.I inspected it prior to getting out of my car because the worker looked suspicious to me.When I stepped out of my vehicle,the Francis and Sons employee directed my attention to my back seat as he went through his sales pitch.As I was about to go into the waiting area,the sketchy M&M employee asked me if I had full coverage and directed me to the passenger side windshield where there was now obvious damage.It is very evident by the tiny hole in the middle if the fine size crater,that a sharp object was pushed or tapped in.I brought this to the attention of Sam the manager of Francis and Sons who immediately defended the glass company and stated how it's not any if his responsibility because they are a separate company.I called the police and while I waited, the manager of the M&M glass came to me and tried to say his employee could not have done it.He saud,\""If you were smart enough,you would know that it takes 80 lbs if pressure to do damage to that glass\"".I called the police.The Gilbert officer went into the Francis and Sons manager's office and viewed the video tape.He told me that the cameras point AWAY from the front of the vehicle.In fact,they point toward the street!he said he could not make a report because there is no proof or witnesses....I could go after them in law suit but he couldn't do anything.Nice little gig they have going there.Im sure they get away with it all the time.They could have done more damage or stolen something, be ware!"
1;The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   \n\nFood quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  \n\nOverall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food.
4;While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop.
3;Since I moved to Henderson I have been desperately looking for a quality pizzeria that delivers and I think I finally found it! I have sampled several different pizzerias over the last year and Mama Depalma's is the best.  Pizza was classic NY style, good thin crust, good tasting sauce, quality cheese, baked perfectly and delivered within an hour.  I can't wait until my next order.
2;So I called Mamma Mia and asked about getting two large cheese pizzas and a cannoli for delivery to SkyPark and the youngish woman who answered my call to Momma Mia said that they won't deliver to SkyPark (literally across the parking lot) anymore so I needed to walk over and get my own pizzas, and also that because I had called the pizza place directly (and not had a SkyPark employee call in my order) they had to charge me a higher price for the pizzas!  WTF?!  \n\nExtremely annoyed I turned to the SkyPark employee, while still on the phone with the pizza place, and asked him why he didn't call in the order for me since I had to pay a higher price if I called them, and he just shrugged his shoulders, clearly unsure what to tell me.  \n\nSo after a few minutes I walked over to Mamma Mia where I explain I am there for the pizzas that I called in and I ask why I had to pay a higher price when the SkyPark staff were the ones to instruct me to call them directly, and the cashier immediately starts to go into this great rant about how SkyPark owes them money and they won't deliver pizzas to them anymore and blah, blah, blah...I couldn't believe it.  Mortified was the only emotion I felt.  \n\nSo I paid for my pizzas, checked in on Yelp, got my food and left.  It is worth noting that the pizza was good (flavorful, cheesy and hot) and I got the cannoli free for checking in on Yelp, but yeah, the general attitude from them sucked!  I'm never going back.  \n\n\nThere is never a reason to share dirty business laundry with your customers like that, it's very unprofessional!
3;"5 Stars\nService:  Everyone was very friendly and answered all questions regarding the menu and details about the restaurant.  This is casual dining, so you order and sit down; however the staff came by our table many times to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.  \nGrilled Pizzas: Holy crap, the grilled pizza was unreal.  We got the house made pesto pizza with bell peppers and onions.  The flavor was fresh, the dough was much lighter than any other pizza I've had and the portion was large enough for two people to get their fill.  \n\n4 Stars:\nAmbience:  I really like the set up, very reminiscent of Brixx's but still unique.  They have a bar in the middle, booths on one side, and a long wooden table in the front for big groups.  The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).  \nMozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.  They could certainly use a little more salt but they were very appetizing.\n\n3 Stars: \nTrue Traditional Pizza:  Maybe this speaks to how good our experience has been but this was the only thing about the restaurant that made me go \""ehh.\""  The pizza was good but it was very bready and the toppings were very light for $1 a topping.  The difference between this pizza and the grilled pizza was enormous.  I also felt like it was less food for more money.  \n\nOverall, I love this place.  I still want to try the oven baked pizzas and the home made gelato but I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh new pizza experience in South Charlotte.  It looks like they have a good local beer selection to so I am eager to try that one weekend.\n\nBottom Line: Get the grilled pizza!"
2;Concord Mills constantly amazes me, and not just because it's the #1 tourist destination in NC, but because there are so dang many people there all the time (which I guess does contribute to that fact). It's like every time I go there, they have added another lane to some road or another. I guess those people have to get in (or out) somehow.\n\nAnyway, if I were going to visit Best Buy most times, I probably would not go to Best Buy at Concord Mills. But I happened to be there for some other reason, so we popped over, and you know what? It wasn't too bad. At least I wasn't seeing those ladies who have decided to wait 22 days to get a TV for $200.\n\nThe staff her is oddly hands-off, even more so than most Best Buy places, but that's a good thing - I don't like them to get too much into my face as I'm looking for stuff I can't afford. At least they give you a pretty convenient entrance to get in and out without having to mess with the rest of the mall traffic all that much.
1;Oh Dickens... You can't utter the name of the place without shaking your head.\n\nIt looks exactly how you would imagine it on the inside. The only surprising thing is the locals. No shouting, no balling, everyone was strangely quiet (on a Saturday afternoon!!). The staff looked like they were going to slip into a coma at any point, totally disinterested at the world.\n\nNot bar of the year, but I doubt they care.
3;always great stuff. I've been to better ones. But this one is pretty neat, good selection and excellent parking!
1;As mentioned below - and being as close as they are to the Phoenix megalopolis - they need to supervise the range very carefully - but even so, and as experienced as I am, the scene makes me very uncomfortable.  It can be very intimidating and a real turnoff to someone who is relatively new.
0;"Today I read a food critic's column in the Las Vegas Review Journal's NEON section which gave 4 A ' s to a new restaurant at Town Square, POT LIQUOR CAS. Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated."
2;Don't expect friendly service from the staff there.  The telephone receptionist is VERY rude.  The lanes however make up for the poor service.
4;Best park on the west side of Vegas. I'm here all the time. It's good for younger toddler years also. Very safe. A lot of room and different toys to play on. Seems like it's well run and managed. The architecture, sand pits, and rope climber are all so unique. My daughter loves the snake and lizard statues. There's something for everyone here. AND a water park in the summer.
1;"The name Cardinal Pizza is sort of a misnomer for this (mainly) Latin American restaurant that specializes in Salvadoran and Nicaraguan food.  Yes, pizza is on the menu; however, when I went for lunch, I didn't see any pizzas being ordered.\n\nI spent part of my summer in Nicaragua last year, and I had some AMAZING papusas down there.  Since then, I've had a serious papusa craving, and when I saw the sign in the window, I figured I'd give them a shot.  While they got the basic idea, Cardinal Pizza's papusas aren't even close to the ones I had in Managua.  They're a bit bland, and the salsa and cabbage-like toppings weren't great, either.  Unfortunate, but live and learn..."
3;These people are awesome.\nTip - if you're a GOLD member, go downstairs.  You'll wait upstairs for an hour!!!\nClean cars ready to go!
1;Food was so bland. Everything was cooked really well and great portion sizes but overall the food was kinda flavorless.
1;Ive only been to this place a handful of times, and I think tonight will be my last. The first few times we ate there I thought it was pretty good, but more recently I cant say the same. The food is fairly tasteless, the beans taste like they are out of a Rosarita can, and the rice could pass for TV dinner. Im not sure if this place is going down hill or what, but it was a little pricey for what we got. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, a shredded beef chimichanga that came with beans and rice and a small soda, it came to $22 and some change. Chips and salsa are complimentary. Call me cheap but I can think of many other places where I could spend that $22 that wouldnt leave me walking away feeling like I overpaid for not so great food. \n\nI will say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish for that reason I could give a better review but the food just doesnt quite cut it.
2;"Great staff but food unfortunately was lacking. Perhaps it just so happened that I ordered the \""wrong\"" dish (a rather mediocre Farfalle Alfredo) but I never enjoyed their butternut squash ravioli in the past either so...\nI will give them props for dessert though. The lemon tower cake was luscious and served with the freshest strawberries."
2;Holy douche bag central!  It's places like these is the reason why I don't frequent Scottsdale too often.  It's full of douche bags.  The hotel is a trendy hotel and people like to be seen at trendy places.  I try to avoid them, but in this case I had no choice.  The rooms are really nice, but definitely not worth the price.  I mean it's Scottsdale people, not a mega metropolis where you can get these room rates.  Try to avoid the pool at all costs because it is full of meat heads and girls who are gold diggers.  But if that's your sort of thing have at it, because I don't want it!
1;I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves. \n\nThat said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul.
0;I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent. \n\nI gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.  \n\nThe scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.  \n\nMy 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.   \n\nWe ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).\n\nThe next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.  Instead it was shocking and put us in a bad mood because the El hefe staff refused to help with such a SIMPLE task. \n\nI don't think there will be a 3rd visit.
3;"Great sushi, I really haven't had anything else, I've been twice for lunch.  Very wide range of rolls to choose from, and the sashimi love boat is amazing!  Reasonably priced, clean, great service; highly recommended."
3;"After spending way too much on my hair cuts over the past few years at salons, I decided to go for the first time into a barber shop with the candy-twirling cylindrical thingy out front.  I had visions of old men getting their ear hair trimmed and getting their sides slicked down with Brylcreem.\nWell, this family-run place has its fair share of old men, but all the barbers have been cutting hair for a good number of years.  This place has weathered the Old Town recession because of good prices, friendly barbers, and decent cuts.  Although they are slowly changing the interior to be more sports-ish (they already have a few TVs on ESPN all the time), they still have the requisite late 80's male hair portraits (which give an uncomfortable gay-man is watching me vibe).  A few of the barbers give excellent shaves.  While two women of the family work there, they are also good at what they do.  My only wish for this place is that they get a few more bigger flat screens and take down those hair portraits because I have yet to witness a dude walking in and point up at the wavy hair of the guy in a popped up collar pink shirt and say \""that's how I want my hair\"".\n***Cash Only***"
0;"I called a psychic for a phone reading and boy, it was AWFUL. She basically asked my sign and gave generic attributes about it. Not worth the money.\n\nAlso, it felt very much like a \""Psychic Network Hotline.\"" Not personalized or warm at all."
4;Too bad but this shop has closed.  They were really good.  Now we do not have a real coffee shop.
2;Small but cute. The wait staff was nice and the place is clean. Good pizza, pasta needed to be drained a little bit more but the marinara sauce was flavorful.  The place was real hot however.  Not too comfortable.  However, it won't stop me from trying it again.
1;Well there is no food, beer, music, or anything else for that matter here.  Its the health office.  This is where you come to pay $50 to watch an hour long movie about washing your hands where they give you a quiz, but after the movie the instructor gives you all the answers allowing any average joe to come get their health card.  Get here at least an hour early before the scheduled movie time.  The waiting is ridiculous, but hey thats how government works.  Inefficient as possible.
3;Topless vampire lesbians. Cloth dancers hanging from ceiling. Nunchuck/katana fights. Styx. Drunk dudes yelling obscenities at all the above.  Great performance by all. That being said, two of the erotic rock angels had the WORST boob jobs ever! NASA would have to invest decades in a bra to get those suckers back together again! Other girls were all gorgeous. Come sail away with this show. Worth the money if you're into topless vampires and 80's metal!
2;Just your standard diner.  Nothing special, but good food, salad bar, good size portions.  If your not looking for anything fancy, but just want to get something to eat it's the place to go.  Meatloaf dinner with mash potatoes and green beans, with soup or salad was $8.95.  Was hot tasty, maybe too much gravy.
2;We went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. \n\nWe tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. \n\nService was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance.
4;American Shooters is a great place to purchase a firearm or shoot at the range. Very helpful and friendly staff. Made me feel very comfortable and confident in selecting a firearm. The range is very nice and clean, you can even shoot your own ammo.
2;Wanted to find a place to buy tortillas since I moved here. When I seen this place off of Grand, I had to stop here and try it out! I bought two dozens of flour and corn tortillas, one pork, one cheese tamale, and a bag of tortilla chips! The only item I was impressed with was their chips??? Their corn tortillas was OK, nothing special! Tends to break apart while trying to eat it. Flour tortilla had no flavor, just pain piece of bread. Tamale was OK. I could name four restaurant you can get a better tamale at. So, I was happy with my chips anyway! great flavor, not to much salt. Being from SoCal, their were plenty of tortilla shops better then here, hopefully I can find another place to try?
1;Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3.\n\nI order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway.\n\nOn the plus side, the server was really nice. So, yeah.
1;First, let me say that most of the reasons this place gets only 2 stars has to do with my opinion that the whole Red Robin chain has gone downhill in recent years. The meat is not particularly tasty anymore and the bottomless fries are now served in a literally bottomless cup which is more of a hassle than it's worth. So it goes, I suppose.\n\nThere were somethings that I made this particular visit sub-par though. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. Even after our food arrived we had to ask 2 different servers for utensils so that we could have napkins. Were either of these things disastrous? No. But they were unpleasant and when coupled with the prior comments about the  food were enough to make me think twice about coming back.
2;Long lines are typically a good sign of a solid food truck, but I think they might have been having some internal/logistical issues at the time. Ordered the chicken Mr. Bahn Mi-Yagi and was severely underwhelmed. Maybe their grill wasn't working 100% but the dog just about matched the air temp after our wait and the flavors left me wanting so much more. I felt like the small amount of radishes had more of a bite than the sriracha sauce did, which was really strange.\n\nMaybe the sun sapped my sense of taste but I felt like I had just eaten a truck stop wiener and not the gourmet experience I had been hyped to try for so long. I'd be willing to try again, but not that particular dog. The 3AM looked interesting, and the elotes locos dog looked really tasty, I think I might have just ordered their weakest offering in the bahn mi dog. Meh.
0;Not sure what's going on with this restaurant. Had dinner there tonight and the place was practically deserted. They didn't have the wine we wanted and several items from the printed menu were not available. I had the ribs. They smelled great, but that's where it ended. The meat was dry and although the menu stated the dish came with sweet potato fries, guess what, they came with regular fries.\nThe bread pudding was good, though, and the waitress was very friendly, apologizing for every disappointment we faced.\nBut I would take a pass on this place, at least until they get their act together.\nBack to my first comment about the dinning room being empty: perhaps others have had similar experiences... Hope things improve in the future.
3;They tend to have a great selection of conventionally grown produce (and, no, it's not really a farmer's market.. I wish!).  Their organic produce selection has grown in the past 5 years that I've been shopping here, so I think they'll only grow more with time.  They now at least have a section dedicated to O produce so you don't have to hunt around for it.\n\nOn Wednesdays, they have double-dip days.. meaning that the previous week's ads and the upcoming week's ads are active on the same day - double the deals!\n\nTheir meat section is decent - they always carry Organic beef and Organic chicken, and they have Lamb usually and Bison on occasion.  Of course conventional pork, beef, chicken, etc are always there. \n\nI would have to say the biggest pluses to this place are their bulk items - everything form choc chips to almond flour.. trail mixes... legumes... all kinds of nuts.. baking flours and even alternative snacks (apricots, dried currants, etc).  The other plus is the Vitamin section - TONS and TONS of options for all kinds of supplements, herbs, vitamins, whatever.. it's a great place to get cosmetics, too as they carry all the Alba, Avalon, Burts, Toms, etc.\n\nOccasionally they have the 25% off days for anything in the VItamins/Supplements area or from the Bulk section..  I go crazy up in this place stocking up!\n\nTheir wine selection is actually very nice for a grocery their size.  They tend to carry small batch vineyards at times and that's nice to grab on occasion.\n.
4;Our second visit. Phenomenal sandwiches and baked goods. I had the Eggplant Grilled Cheese sandwich today - the best sandwich I've had anywhere in months. Wife had the Waffle, Eggs, and Ham sandwich with a rosemary bechamel sauce. Killer. We will be back....often!!
3;I too went to eat my first Cronut.  All they had left was coconut creme filling and guava filling, so I bought them up.  One of the cooks rang me up, and was very knowledgeable and pleasant as we spoke about the finer points of Cronut science.\n\nSo I guess it would make more sense to grade the components separately...\n\nCronut -- A: This was my cheat day, so what feels to be a 3000 calorie bomb tastes every bit as good as a 3000 bomb should.  Heavy, dense, and delicious.  Crunchy on the outside and chewy inside.  The texture and for the most part flavor was like nothing I had experienced before.  The two days it takes to make them is worth it, nice job guys.\n\nFilling -- D-: Real problems here.  First off, the flavor is nice, but very subtle.  I could only taste the coconut and guava when I had it on its own, and it was faint.  You just cannot put something with subtle hints of flavor on a full-flavor bomb like a Cronut.  You'll never taste it.  Second, the texture.  Both fillings had a runny, snotty texture that made an absolute mess all over the place.  Whether you eat it like a Big Mac, or you take it apart piece by piece and eat it that way, you can't escape it going all over the place.  Since it doesn't really taste like much anyway, I took a knife, scraped it off, and STILL managed to get it all over the plate and my fingers.  Magic stuff I tell ya.  For something so delicious, the experience as a whole really suffers because of this.  Such an easy fix, I hope they can figure it out.\n\nI'd definitely be willing to go back in a few months on another cheat day to try a different flavor and see if that makes a difference.
1;"Very disappointed.  Prices are high and the resort fee rubs you wrong.  We rented 2 rooms on the \""family plan\""', only to find the pricing on Expedia to be much better - to late, 3 day cancellation.  Both of our rooms had extremely dirty carpet, and one was supposed to be a suite.  How carpet gets that dirty on the 6th floor I will never know but I really don't think it's been shampooed in years.  Paddle boarding is $30 first hour then $20 an hour after that.  Food prices in all restaurants is very high with not many options off property.  This property does not live up to the westin name.  I wouldn't suggest anyone stay at this location"
0;Forget this place, we came in at 2:45pm. They state that their restaurant closed at 3pm, but they kicked us out for no reason. No respect and they give no customer value. Change your damn closing time if you won't even work up to it. Pathetic. Thank god we didn't even go there. Their sushi sucks. Worst sushi in Vegas honestly.
0;This is certainly not a French restaurant. The waitress didn't even know what brioche is, not that they serve it here. The brioche here is just toast.  The Corn Beef Hash wash cubed beef not hash and not very good.  The cappuccino was mediocre. Sour dough waffles, gouffles, nothing special. I wanted a souffle and my wife wanted a brioche. Neither were available. French, absolutely not.  Tourist trap, yes.  Never again for us.\n\nThis is Vegas.  I don't care if the food is pricey as long as it's good.  Don't waist your time here.
2;I like this place for some reason.  Cheap food and cheap room.  Thats all you need.  And also the fun zone downstairs is great for hours.  Pool sucks but this hotel is always fun.
2;"THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING BREAKFAST BURRITO -- The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my \""treats\"" I allow myself occasionally and I have enjoyed them for years at this location. Unfortunately over the last year or so, this amazingly sinful wrap of goodness has deteriorated into an OK breakfast burrito. Less cheese, less egg, less chorizo (more potatoes) and probably 30% smaller than before. I understand everybody's gotta make a buck, but I probably won't be spending mine there anymore."
1;This is not an exciting candy store and the stock looks old. The self serve candy bins offer a decent variety and you'll find plenty of Jelly Belly beans if that's your thing, but I've seen way cooler and more fun candy shops.\n\nI was specifically looking for some giant gummy bears and they had only 1 left, which wasn't that giant at all and it looked like it had been sitting there forever.\n\nThere's also a Bilboquet ice cream shop inside, with hard ice cream and sorbet to choose from but it looked messy and unappealing. Flavors are hard to read, scribbled on a chalk board. If you're looking for ice cream, there's a shop right across the street that will prove to be much more satisfying.
4;Located off the strip, on the other side of the 15 freeway is the Palace Station Hotel. I have never set foot in this hotel/casino in my life until my friend told me that I need to go try the Oyster Bar here. Although, I'm not a big fan of raw oysters because of what it can potentially do to my bowels, I was assured that they have plenty of other (sea)food items to choose from.\n\nThe Oyster Bar is literally a horse shoe style bar (think shabu shabu). No frills, no tables, just a bar and stools. Everything is made, prepped, and served right in front of you. Because of this, be prepared to wait. It's worth it, trust me! Although we only had about eight people in front of us, it still took about an hour to get seated. Also, if you roll deep, expect to split up. This place though is opened 24/7. Maybe if you creep in around 4am then the line will be short unless all the drunken clubbers and strippers are present.\n\nIt seems like everyone has mixed reviews about the different food items here. Personally, the House Gumbo ($20) is the Royal Flush in my opinion. It's big enough for two people. The flavor will blow the socks off your feet. I had a New Orleans native with me and even she was impressed. I would come back and wait the long @$$ line just for this. I've been fantasizing about this gumbo ever since.\n\nThe jambalaya was my next favorite item we shared. It was a little bit runny at first but as the rice sits, it'll slowly soaks up the sauce. Another flavorful delight and massive in size.\n\nThe Seafood Pan Roast was good but it doesn't trump the other two items I sampled. It's heavily raved about, but I can go back to the Oyster Bar and pass it up.\n\nI like how each of these items was made right in front of us in these cool looking, silver/metal gadgets. It's hard to explain what they are so just check out the pictures or go there yourself and pay attention to how your food is being made. You'll be fascinated at how easy the chefs will make it look. Their secret is in the pre-made sauces of course. Our chef Blake was calm and collective even though he had a lot on his plate. Patrons were eagerly gawking at each dish he made, impatiently waiting their bite.\n\nFew suggestions: try not to come during peaked times. Share dishes and be aware that the portions are huge. Also, keep the party to a minimum unless you don't mind splitting up. Lastly, bring your appetite and taste buds because like watching Seigfreid and Roy, you're about to get mesmerized.
1;Elliot's recently moved to the old Meadowview steakhouse location (much, much larger than the end of the strip mall where they used to be found, but still very close).\n\nI'm a fan of local, family-run business, especially ones that seem to be doing well.  If the business is doing well enough to move from the strip mall to the Meadowview, I'd say they are doing pretty well, so I'm excited.  Even though I ate their barbecue a few years ago and wasn't impressed, I figure it's time to try it again.\n\nWe went in on a Saturday afternoon, and the cavernous room was just about empty.  Seriously.  This huge room - outfitted to be reminiscent of the old building - had one other table with customers.  We spent probably ten minutes talking to the cashier and were not interrupted.  After we sat down, another couple came in.  That may not be a good sign.  But it's for another discussion.\n\nI decided that I would order a combo plate so that I could taste the barbecue and the brisket.  I've actually had brisket (in Texas, to be fair) that I loved, and I really would like to find someone in Charlotte who can do it justice, so I keep trying.\n\nThe brisket?  Nah.  It just isn't worth it, so don't bother.  The pulled pork is okay, but it doesn't have much flavor.  They do have some sauces that you can add, and they are okay, but nothing special.  The thing that really gets me is that their mac and cheese really has potential, it has consistency just like my grandmother used to make.  But again, it has no flavor.  It seems they used a bunch of actual cheese, rather than just using velveeta or something, but no mustard or anything else to give it flavor.  Shame, really.\n\nMaybe I'll check back again in another couple of years.
3;My go to place to watch any game. You can always find dogs on the patio too. Service is great, but the food can be hit or miss.
4;Great service, great price, great work and a quick response time. What else can you ask for? I highly recommend Chavez LawnCare.
4;Wow, what a great experience. This was one of the few times I've been in a Sephora as I like make up, but never try new products, etc often! After buying cheap red lipstick bc I wanted to make sure I'd like the color, I decided I want to spend money on nice lipstick. Typically I'm a lip gloss low key lip girl. I went in and Jean was so incredibly helpful and fun with the shopping process. She gave me great tips on how to apply it, helped me pick out a great color which had all the 'color experts' saying how good I looked and went over all the different lipstick options with me. These ladies know how to make you feel good and sell the exact product you're looking for. I defiantly plan on going back when in need of another beauty adventure!
4;Yay!! I'm so happy I FINALLY found a groomer I like! Lilac was great with my two dogs and their haircut was beautiful. They were both nice and fluffy when I picked them up.. and the best part.. no knicks or razor burns anywhere! (This is a plus since I've had too many problems with other groomers in town) The salon was super clean and Lilac was very nice and accommodating. And if you check in on Yelp, you get $10 off!! Two thumbs up!
4;Everything was great.  Requested to split two entr\u00e9es and four separate plates came out...As requested, split entrees.
3;The food is the star if the show here!  Don't get me wrong, the place has been remodeled and looks GREAT inside.  The dining area is totally separate from the bar so you can enjoy smoke free eating.  The ribs at $15.95 are a BARGAIN!  They have SO much meat on them.  You cannot and will not find better for the money ANYWHERE!  Not even Ellis Island.  You can't beat their quality and price.  For you cigar lovers, check out Doc's Cigar Lounge....On West Charleston, West of Valley View...Enjoy!
4;Best pancakes EVER! Enough said. Can't vouch for anything else though...so you're on your own. \n\nSeriously, if you find yourself in Las Vegas with a car or money in your pocket for a 4 mile taxi ride (against traffic so it's only about 10 minutes), then make sure to visit BabyStacks Cafe #2. It is well worth the visit and a good break from all the nasty cafe food on the strip!!!
1;It's mad busy here and donut was kind of whatevers.  If you're in a donut craze and desperate, then why not here?\n\nDrinks are expensive here.  If you want a soda or simple drink, go to McDonalds upstairs.
0;"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
4;Delightful Diner!\n\n I've had breakfast at Toast several times, and every time the service has been fast and efficient. I've always enjoyed my meal, as did my boyfriend, and the prices are decent. Its a clean and cute little place, and the hours are very convenient. \n\n On one occasion, I experienced a small but ironic issue: the toast that came with my eggs was not actually toasted (at a restaurant named 'Toast')! I ended up pointing it out to our waiter when he came to give  the bill and ordered a bagel since I had eaten my eggs and was still hungry (great bagel, btw) and let it go. When the manager came to check on how we were doing he sensed my hesitation when I said everything was fine and he insisted I tell him what I was unhappy about. The manager sincerely wants everyone to be completely satisfied with their meal, and his genuine concern for my small issue made me feel like a valued customer (he discounted the bill and apologized for the ironic flaw). \n\nTry it for yourself. As far as breakfast places go, I think it's wonderful :)
1;"Ok the food is worth trying I will give them that. But the way they lie and treat you the customer is just awful. We originally ordered catfish and they came back about 4 minutes later and told us they didn't have catfish. A customer walked in about 20 minutes after that and when the waitress said they didn't have catfish the big man that runs the place spoke up and said \""yes yes we do have catfish\"". I think he only told that customer they have catfish because he is biased. I am white and they didn't want to serve white people the good stuff it was only for their special guests or other black people. The waitress didn't smile once; when i asked if they had coca cola or dr. pepper she said \""NO!\"" in a very hateful tone and looked at me like i was scum. I felt like I wasn't welcome there the whole time I was there. Gave me the suspicious eye. Let's get rid of the prejudice people. We. Can. All. Get. Along. Anyways if your black, they will call you brother or sister and give you the royal treatment but whites should stay away unless you want shitty ass service."
0;The service is AWFUL! the sloppy waiter made us wait for over an hour even though we had a reservation, and not only that, but he got other people who did NOT have a reservation seated before us!! he was walking back and forth to collect dishes and ignore us and not even apologize... \nafter we eventually got seated, nobody came to take our order for another half an hour... the food was not the best either.. everything arrived only luke-warm.. \nthe worst dining experience ever, all the waiter and waitresses are ignorant and slow slow slooow.. not going back...\nAVOID THIS PLACE!
4;Starting off with a 5 we'got adeal on tickets after seeing show totally would have been happy with paying full price great show funny energetic !!! Great music and production
2;***TIPS***\n\n- This is the closest location to the main vegas strip\n- Don't come between 10pm to midnight, you might have to wait 30 minutes for your food. Its faster to do drive through during these hours.\n- Go after midnight if eating there.
2;I just got back from seeing the Misfits in concert at this joint. It seems smaller than the more well-known House of Blues out there in terms of 'small venues', although a bit bigger than the Railhead at Boulder Station.\n\nThe way the club is set up is kind of strange. There are two bars: one outside the actual stage area and one inside. Then in front of that is the pit and stage of course.\n\nSurprisingly, there's enough room to move around for moshing and crowd surfing. The security here don't seem to care if you start moshing, but if it gets too rowdy then they might stop you. If you're a repeat offender, they may kick you out.\n\nThe acoustics of this place sound very muddled, and I had a hard time deciphering what the band was singing. The instruments also seemed to blend together in a bad way. These are the only downsides to this joint.\n\nA lot of punk rock bands play here, and the week before the Misfits' tour was The Casualties along with Negative Approach and several other bands. LVCS seems to be the 'punk house' for the scene. Hey, that's cool--brings a little more 'arts and culture' to the downtown area, which is something that's badly needed besides First Friday.\n\nThis place should actually be renamed the 'Las Vegas Punk Saloon' since more punk bands play here than country ones. That, go pyschobilly/rockabilly if they wanna stay a little bit Country.\n\nI still think that bands should book somewhere else--the sound is just terrible, plus it's sort of hard to see the bands at times since the stage isn't raised.\n\nOtherwise, not bad for cheap tickets. You'll never find tickets here that cost more than $40. They're all reasonably priced, especially for the amount of bands you're seeing.\n\nP.S. the highlight of the Misfits concert was seeing Jerry Only get off the stage and French-kiss this punk rock chick that was directly in front of him. Mind you, Jerry's in his 50s now, and the chick he kissed seemed to be in her early-to-mid 20s or so. Just damn, man. Then again, I would still hit that no matter what age--Jerry is still hot to me.
4;"Home to good microbrew tap specials, the Hometown Sweethearts, and my upcoming new favorites, Brown Derby!  I find it both fun and relaxing to sit inside and have a nice, cold beer with good company and good tunes going on.  They have a good jukebox if there's no live music.\n\nOccasionally, the service leaves something to be desired, but I just pave over that feeling with more beer.  ;)"
4;Marrow and crispy Brussels are a meal in themselves, and we almost canceled the burgers.  Wow, that wouldve been a mistake!  I luckily found my 2nd stomach... mussels were also good.   gin Richard, and  crimson tide were both really nice cocktails!
4;This is my favorite breakfast/brunch in town.  The Carne Adovada is perfection, and therefore I get it every damned time.  Tender, spiced, sauced porkwads with eggs and I believe breakfast taters on the side.  The spicy bloody is perfection.  I faintly recall the Jalapeno Eggs Benedict being yummy--whoever ordered it shared sparingly and guarded it with their life.\n\nThe joint is dimly lit, so you don't need to wear shades to nurse your hangover.  You sit in cushioned, isolated little adobe booths tucked away in corners--feels intimate to me and never loud.    The staff's always been really friendly.\n\nTen visits and going strong.  I'd be there right now actually if I'd run the prerequisite ten miles this week. :(
2;"2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!\nFor such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) \""I'll never come back here again.\""  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said \""Are you guys the Yelpers?\""  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.\nThe food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.\nI really doubt I would go back just to eat.  \nThe ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed."
4;The Monte Carlo is by far the best hotel for me. It's centrally located in the heart of the strip and despite the recent renovations next door, it still fits in great. I can't eat at any other cafe. Seriously, their food is so good. From their country fried steak to their chicken carbonara. So delicious! Any of their dishes appease any craving that I have. The dishes have always been cooked to perfection (except for the ONE time my hash browns were a little over-done, but it's cool). Other than that, nothing compares to their cafe for the price.\n\nTheir customer service has always been outstanding. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. IF something does go wrong, they always do their best to fix it.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy gambling like myself, the MC is great. I'm a slotty gal so can't say much for the tables, but they have machines that range from $.05 to $5. Can't say the same for Aria next door. $10 video poker?! I ran right back to MC.\n\nThe rooms I have stayed in were always clean. I also tip the maids regardless if they come into my room during my stay. If everyone at least left them a few bucks to show appreciation, it'd go a long way. Oh yeah, tip the cocktail waitresses too. $1 a drink is my rule. It's just a classy thing to do.\n\nAll in all, MC is my #1 hotel in Vegas. Affordable, awesome food, friendly staff, and great for gambling. I tend to never leave MC because I'm usually disappointed with the other options. I love you guys!
3;I had expected this place to be a rather small museum, but it is actually quite large and is packed with artifacts and pieces from Native American tribes.  During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyone's attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want.
2;The good:\n\n* Beer specials - Each night there is a draft beer available in a 24 ounce mug for 4 dollars.\n* Wings - Try the spicy garlic. You can get them baked if you like it that way too.\n* TVs - Tons of them and booths have them as well. Always lots of sports on if that's your thing.\n* Bartenders - Easy on the eyes and usually friendly, unless you're a drunk/creepy guy.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Waitresses - Usually overworked on busy nights, it can take a few minutes to be served or get another drink. Order a pitcher or a 24 ounce mug to avoid waiting long times between service, or if halfway done with a drink and the waitress comes by, order another drink early. Words to live by if you go to a busy bar/restaurant.\n\n* Music - Local music is more often a miss than a hit. Just be aware that sometimes it happens and if you can avoid it you should. Plus it takes away the shuffleboard and pool table area, so those won't be useable during a band.\n\n* Karaoke - I like a good round/night of karaoke but the nights they have it are usually pretty bad. Maybe I've just been unlucky and been there on especially drunken nights. Either way it was hard to sit through. (shots helped though)\n\n* Rowdy Sports Fans - Sometimes things get a bit crazy here during big games, so be prepared if you go on such a night. Big cheap beers and really excited sports fans sometimes means a super loud and occasionally obnoxious environment.
4;What a terrific meal!  We loved the menu from the pate, to the beef carpaccio, to the scallops, everything was well prepared and tasty. Make sure to order the brussel sprout side, it was amazing!
4;Penn Ave Fish (Downtown) is one of my favorite places for lunch takeout.  And it's not a measly few orders.  It's usually around 20 orders including soups, specials, and sushi (all different)!  We call around 11:15a to place the order and they can usually have it ready within an hour.  And more times than not, the orders are perfectly prepared, not forgetting one soup!  \n\nWhen we pick up, the line is usually out the door, so I'm sure it isn't easy to get a large order correct during the prime time lunch rush.  Inside is small, but the chatter and blue iridescent tile d\u00e9cor give it a lively atmosphere.  \n\nThe Ronnie Roll is my favorite! Don't let the bright yellow soy wrap scare you!
3;This is my favorite car wash in Las Vegas.  It's the type where you drive through the automated washer cave inside your car  and then when the cave spits you out your get out and the washer boys vaccuum the inside of your car, shine the wheels, put armorall on your dash, etc. The staff here are so friendly and helpful, both the oil change staff and car wash. They all seem so grateful to be working here which is refreshing.  When I got my oil changed (this gets you a free car wash) it was finished in 20 minutes and I went on a Sunday at about 10am!  Bravo!
3;I absolutely love this place.  Very large selection of very good cigars.  The drinks are fantastic and there is actually a very large selection.  I initially went to this place to purchase cigars as there are some only available at the shop.  My friend and I decided to grab a drink as well.  We got the tangerine mojitos and they were fantastic.  The eye candy at the place is also fantastic.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars really is that it can get incredibly cramped at the front tables.  The price of the drinks were fair for where and what they were.  However some of the cigars were on the bit pricey side which makes sense considering the availability of some of them.
4;We took the greyhound to Montreal and was looking for brunch places near the station. This place has a great selection of food, from Egg Benedict to Crepe/Waffles. Most of their service staff only speak french and the menu is in french, this can be inconvenient but could also be part of the great experience!
3;The green tamales were delicious. i walked to the Steamed Tamale because\n i work just  2 minutes away. By the time i got back to the office needless to say the tamales were gone. Worth the trip and reasonably priced. Owner/staff were very friendly. I hope they stay around.
1;My friends and I happened upon this place on the way to our hostel and, being from Southern California (and therefore having quite a bit of experience with Mexican food), we were so taken aback by a Mexican place in Scotland that we just had to try it. It's a fine attempt, but ultimately misses the mark. My blended margarita didn't taste good, and my beef tacos were a bit over-the-top. The food isn't bad if you're desperate, but I don't think I would go there again.
4;I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!
1;Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we \nProbably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!
2;Ask anyone in town who is a local where to go eat steak, and invariably this place comes up. Walk in the place, and you may have to check to see if you are in the right place. When I first walked into place back in 2005, I was miffed as one side of the place is the dive-st looking bar, and the other is the steakhouse. We turned around and walked out, but after hearing for years how good this place is, I had to go back. \n\nGo here if the steak is important, and the aesthetics are not. If you are looking for a much nicer LOOKING place, then go to Delmonico's, not far away. Everyone I ate with at the Tornado loved their meal (2 steaks, one fish), as did I. Champagne Dan, bartender extraordinaire and food lover to the max (@ the Concourse Hotel - Shout Out to CHAMPAGNE!) recommended either the Venison, or the Flank steak, which he claimed is the owner's favorite. I got the venison, accompanied with a side of hash browns, which may sound strange, but they were damn good and crispy. Haven't eaten much deer in my day, but it was pretty good. \n\nBottom line - if you want steak, here is your place.
4;At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA\nCreme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!
1;"This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet.  We went during \""Happy Hour\"" where the price is only $11.95 per adult.  Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\n\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\n\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It's been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don't need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn't bother you."
2;The service could use some improvement.  This restaurant is understaffed and unable or properly handle peak times.  We were told there is no wait, but  ended up waiting for 20 minutes for a table.  Proper service at the bar is also lacking.\n\nOn the bright side, the beer selection is good and the food is pretty tasty.  If you're willing to wait and don't mind poor service, give this place a try.
3;"Just like In & Out Burger,  \""keep it simple and they will come\"".\n\nI though my sandwich was small but I could barely finish it, it was dense with meat.  I got the Cheese Steak and I must say it's close to one of the best I've had.  Next time I will get the Bobbie, look up the website and the menu.\n\nI can't wait to go back......"
4;Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)
3;My second visit was MUCH better than the first.  The General Manager /staff/server made every effort to make sure we had a wonderful brunch for my mother in laws 85th birthday.  I will say that the General Manager contacted me after my first yelp review and told me to contact him when in town to give the restaurant another try.  As a small business owner, I was totally impressed with this personal touch.  It also resulted in a very pleasant second meal at Morels.  \n\nWe dined inside on this visit, and that was a very pleasant experience.  Nice, crisp, clean dining room with lovely paintings (of a sexual nature!) on the walls.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nMy husband and I shared the fried prawns, and they were DELICIOUS!  I loved the basil dip that came with it and saved it to go with my frites.  YUMM.  I ordered the steak frites, which was very good....even better with the dip (or pistou as the menu calls it).  \n\nWe had a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our great meal.\n\nI will happily return in September for brunch when I am at my yearly conference in Vegas.
0;"The restaurant was empty an hour after the football game. This is a bad sign. We waited 30 min for our food. Our food was cold. One member of our party did not receive his meal with the remainder of the group. When the group complained the server said \""the cook is new and is messing everything up.\""  We paid for our drinks and left. Worst service ever. Horrible food. Several other parties walked out as well. Do not waste your time. Walk across the street to Gordon Biersch."
1;Must say one of the worst buffet I had. The foods had limited favors, not much of a selection and please don't try their Pho! Dessert I must say was great.
3;The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla, topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world.
0;"Rude front desk person, horrible experience.  The girl cutting/styling my hair wanted to send me out with just dry hair, no styling. I asked her to please style it and she gave me high school pin curls of some sort with 1/2 can hair spray.  I asked for a blow out, you know round brush?  Awful.  The \""free manicure\"" was just a polish change since they don't cut cuticles so what's even the point? She also ran out of time since it took 2 1/2 hours to trim and style my hair.  No thanks. Go to Paul Mitchell or Aveda Institute."
0;"We stopped by here prior to going to a Cirque show on our first night in Vegas.  I made reservations for 5 so I expected to have a table ready at that time.  Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\n\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \""Spago\"" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \n\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \n\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned..."
3;Looks like Marie Calendars again... so glad!  missed the pies
4;The starter they offer is fresh chips and salsa and it was AMAZING, I haven't had fresh salsa like that since I was in Texas! \n\nI would definitely suggest you visit this restaurant if you're at the NY hotel, we got the enchiladas and they were the best I'd EVER had (better than when I was in Mexico)! The menu has an excellent variety of Mexican food and the pricing is excellent for anyone on a budget. The portions are also very well sized (enough to share and be full). \n\nABSOLUTELY A MUST WHILE YOU ARE IN LV! :D
0;This place has really went downhill. Really nothing open at all only whole foods and a couple other stores and 3 restaurants. I think if they did something to this place and add more stores like pacsun and NIKE and other teen and men stores then this place would be better
3;$2.50 pints all day, good food, lots of TVs.   A good find in my neighborhood.
0;"WARNING!! They do not take responsibility! $1500.00 car wash. My truck had a tiny crack in the side plastic panel that makes up the entire rear side . It was underneath and not noticeable, at first glance.  Someone at this location did notice it, so he put a piece of tape on it, because he was concerned about more damage. He DID NOT WARN ME! I would have not gotten it washed! After the damage was done he came in a got me and showed me what they had done. So my $20.00 was more important to them than my truck. They are refusing responsibility. The GM  \""Tiger\"" would only refer me to the sign that says that they don't take responsibility. I hope this crappy business gets everything they deserve. I am not done pursuing this. Look out Tiger, if I have my way you might lose your Christmas bonus!"
3;"Mabels feels almost like a speakeasy; some forgotten 1920s haunt, dimly lit and awkwardly tucked away off of the main drag in Old Town Scottsdale. It is run efficiently by capable, friendly staff who genuinely enjoy chef Aaron May's fun cooking and who know how to pour a drink.\n\nUp until this point in your life, you've likely never tried a deviled egg burger: a burger lovingly prepared with a smattering of delicious deviled egg, with a perfect bit of cheese all on a wonderful english muffin of sorts. This simple fact needs to be remedied: try one at your earliest convenience.\n\nIt will get everywhere, as the burger is too big for its britches, and the deviling helps not a bit with cleanliness, but the flavor is fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail brings about a very few (four, I believe, in my case) enormous shrimp, but at roughly $2.25 a pop, I don't think I'd repeat, though the cocktail sauce is delightfully prepared and the shrimp are as big as your fist.\n\nThe bar is wonderful and eccentric, and on Tuesdays, you can attempt to stump Chef May. Though I haven't tried yet, it sounds like a world of fun in its own right. Better still, they pour heavy, which is good as the cocktails can run in the $7-$14 range.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is subdued; you almost hope it'll be smoky each time you walk in. The stamped tin roof is fun and the penny-floor is a quirky touch in the men's bathroom. And don't forget to ask about Moby Dick. \n\nA good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu, but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks. The happy hour, though frustratingly placed in the middle of the work week, is an amazing deal and I might just have to try to convince the office to abscond one Thursday."
4;I love them here.  Always been a great experience.   Best doctors ever, very caring.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!
0;"Don't even think about eating here...I ate here twice, once for the dinner buffet and the other time in their restaurant for breakfast.  In both cases the atmosphere was depressing, the food bland and tasteless, the servers, absolutely superb.  I have never seen servers/waitresses more upbeat and friendly, it's a shame they are given such a poor product. One waitress in particular when I commented on the food just rolled her eyes, she seemed to immediately understand exactly what I was saying. There was a waitress in the restaurant where I had breakfast, think I heard she was 68, and I told her that she was 100 times better than the food, and that says it all.\n\nThe buffet selection is poor, the ceilings are incredibly low, the food is bland, it's just a yucky atmosphere.\n\nI actually like the hotel, you can find some incredible rates for staying there on i4vegas, just don't eat there.\n\nHas to be one of the most depressing buffets I've ever been at in Las Vegas.  Seriously, you don't know me, but in this instance, \""trust me\"".\n\nGo elsewhere to eat, even for breakfast, no matter how cheap it is.\n\nYuck."
2;Wow, an AM/PM that doesn't slam you with fees for using a debit card! Nice. This location was clean, well stocked, but also a bit of a pain to get in and out of. Still this was the first AM/PM store I've visited in the entire Vegas valley that I would go back to. (If Quiktrip ever expands out of Phoenix they would wipe the floor with this place, but I'm just dreaming. At least it's better than any Terrible Herbst location!)
1;Having read the reviews and checked out the menu and decor in person before deciding on it, I could not have been more surprised to have such a disappointing experience.  \n\nThe wine by-the-glass list is inexplicably short, but the options are decent.  The view of the fountains is great at certain tables.  We were not at one of those tables.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n-  Crispy Eggplant (chef's special appetizer): tasty, but oddly dry.  Served with an overly dusty coating and no sauce.\n\n-  Hot and Sour Soup:  All hot, no sour, with an unwelcome sweetness.  They took it off the bill, though.\n\n-  Kung Pao Chicken:  Bland in taste and texture, with large, flat medallions of tough chicken and super-sweet cashews overpowering any hope of a savory note.\n\n-  Braised Kobe Short Ribs:  Stew meat served on a gelatinous bed of noodles oozing some kind of thin brown liquid.  Tasteless and unappetizing for everyone at the table.\n\nWe were far too disappointed by this point to try dessert.  Plus we were both still hungry, so we left and got chili-cheese fries at Snacks on the casino floor.  Now THOSE were really good!
2;Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant, we were here for the bar/lounge scene. We paid $20 to get in and have free drinks the whole night, so that was a plus. I'd say this is one of those places where you're better off splurging on bottle service, because that's the only way you're going to have any room to dance and not bump into anybody. The DJ was decent, no one special, just spinning the latest Top 40 tracks. I enjoyed the crowd, which was a plus as I spent most of my time there smashed up against them as I was dancing. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here during my next trip to Vegas and trying the cuisine!
4;Can I just say that I miss the Chai lattes here???  Mo-fo's is the only place I know of that uses ACTUAL tea to make these, and not that crappy syrup. I'm ruined for any other Chai experience...RUINED. Someone find me a respectable chai on the west side, please!
1;So, you stay here and you're off the strip... the good thing is that they have a shuttle that will take you to the strip between the hours of 9:30am and midnight.  I didn't take it since we never actually made it to the strip.  It's a nice hotel overall.  The decor is nice, everything looks relatively new and clean.  The rooms are good, especially if you're in the suites.  Those are really nice.  HOWEVER, I have to say that the beds are terribly uncomfortable.  They're hard and so are the pillows.  I had shoulder and neck problems from them.  Also, check your pillows for possible bed bugs, as I met a woman in line for breakfast with bites all over her face from an unknown source - the last time I saw something like that it was bedbugs at a hostel.\nThe cafe downstairs is nothing major.  Decent food at any hour.  Nothing special to speak of.  During the 12:30am hour service was slow and kind of unfriendly.  During the 10am hour it was speedy and friendly.  We did the buffet on the last day there... $15 per person but terrible food.  The only fresh fruit on the salad bar was watermelon- all the rest was canned in sweet juice.  Blech!  The desserts looked better than they tasted, though the chocolate chip cookie was good.  The majority of the food wasn't anything better than what was served in the cafe restaurant, it was the same actually.  Same mediocre quality.  The cheese crepes were terrible and made with cottage cheese rather than ricotta like they're supposed to, and who puts strawberry jam in a fruit crepe?  Not good quality.\nThe staff was always friendly throughout the rest of our interactions.  It's a decent place if you're not looking for a great party experience in Vegas.  Also, it seemed this was best suited for the over 35 crowd (sorry, but I'm young and like a different experience!).
1;Everything was perfect--the service, the timeliness, the atmosphere...\n\n...everything EXCEPT THE FOOD.\n\nI can't give a restaurant a good review if the food isn't good, especially at this price point. Here's the run-down:\n\nDRINKS: Okay, these were good. The Mulo Romano and Amore Amaro were probably highlights of the meal.\n\nWARM OLIVES: Fine. These were the highlight of the food, but the texture was a little mushy--not firm and fresh like olives should be. The orange peel garnish added a nice, unexpected element that made the dish more complex. Eat this part with the olives if you decide to order this.\n\nARANCINI: They were hard balls of bland, puffy, overcooked rice. Looking back on images that other people posted on Yelp of their Cento arancini, the kitchen must have also run out of cheese. Ours came with a light dusting of powdered parm rather than an ample melty layer of shredded cheese as is seen in another photo. \n\nSOURDOUGH WITH LOCAL BUTTER: They really play with words to make this starter sound romantic. 5 half-slices of bread come with a ball of butter in a little pool of olive oil. The flavors were one-note. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper grinders on the table so we could customize the dish ourselves. I understand that good restaurants don't offer salt and pepper on the table because the chef wants customers to experience each dish as he/she creates it, but everything else we had that night could have used some more seasoning.\n\nFRIED SQUID: Over-fried squid was rubbery. The romesco sauce was good, but it was the only source of flavor on the plate. The grilled lemons would have been a great touch if we were able to squeeze some juice out of the paper-thin slices.\n\nBLACK TAGLIATELLE: The pasta itself had a gluey, pasty texture that wasn't pleasant. I wondered if it was the squid ink, but after doing a little research post-visit, this wasn't the case. Our tagliatelle also didn't have much sauce, and what was there tasted like cream and not much else. Very bland. This was disappointing because so many Yelpers rave about this dish, and their photos show a nice golden sauce. \n\nAfter reading so many positive reviews, my man and I had greatly anticipated our visit here. But because the food was so expensive, but not good, we don't care to visit again.
4;Had an inspection done recently for a home I am buying in Scottsdale. I was so happy I chose this company. I met the inspector at the home and he was so helpful and knowledgeable  (his name was Tom). I'm a single mom and know nothing about home problems and repairs. Tom went thru his entire inspection and several pictures. He told me which items were concerns and which items were typical. When he finished my realtor and I knew exactly what we needed to ask the seller to do. Tom also gave me a list of repair people who could do some improvements. Overall I was very happy with his service and knowledge. I feel so much better knowing what the existing problems were and who could  take care  of some things I wanted done. Very helpful and professional. Great service great experience.
1;"Returned in hopes of another afternoon feeding the birds/ducks/geese and fun time at the park. Alas, we showed up with a full bag of white bread and some crackers, typical fowl faire. First thing I noticed versus last time was that ALL the birds/ducks/geese have turned into ultra aggressive, threatening beasts from a B-movie. They were mobbing me nearly to the point of an altercation. I am 6'6\"" and felt a bit freaked., my 6 year old was managing better than I. I was answered by a friendly, although haggard security guard. He screamed from nearby, STOP, DONT FEED THE BIRDS. Seems they have a few signs that say the same. I asked him about this a few minutes after stopping and he told me it is city rules now. One,\""white bread isn't good for ducks. Unbuttered popcorn is best.\"" Two,\""people have complained about the poop on the sidewalks.\"" So, thanks to all you ultra-animal lovers and snobby moms for ruining this rather enjoyable time for us all. But, i guess we all foot the bill to pay this poor man who has to holler at parents with kids like a Grinch when he could muster up his dignity to work somewhere protecting or safeguarding something more valuable than your crummy loafers and animals that I have never seen suffer from gobbling up Wonder Bread. Give me a Friggen Break... \nThe park was still fun and we had a good time regardless. \nGeez, just what this city needs know on a stretched budget, \""Duck Police\"". Great job you all who are scared of nature and the scary things it might leave on your precious sidewalks. And BTW, animal lovers, they brought the ducks to live at the pond! There are MANY other places that might need your attention than this one park..."
2;Something within me has changed over the last few years, the need for overtly large portions of heart stopping food has died down. The food is not bad, but there is nothing extremely special about it either. I resisted the urge to order the sage fried chicken with bacon waffles in a vain attempt of sparring myself the unbearable guilt which would follow, but ordering anything on the menu is bound to lead to that anyways. \n\nI went there with a friend to catch up after being away for some time. This location was completely dead. I have been to the one on Sahara a few times before and waited for more than 30 minutes. The hostess was very polite and asked if we had a preference for a booth or table. We chose a booth and sat by ourselves. Maybe everyone else was on the other side, but it felt like a ghost town. The bus-person came around to take our drink orders in a timely fashion. The waitress then came by to take our orders. I was not ready yet, because I was still trying to find something that wouldn't give me a heart attack, but those bacon waffles kept taunting me. I am a sucker for salty and sweet. \n\nIn the end I ordered the bacon, swiss, and avocado scramble with crispy potatoes. I will not lie, everything on my plate was decent, just not spectacular. The scramble itself was fluffy with cheese oozing out. The bacon gave it a little saltiness from the otherwise bland combination. The avocado was sparse compared to the generous helping of everything else on the plate. The potatoes were my favorite part. Usually I can do without all the extra carbs, but these were fried crispy with the center not being dried out which was then tossed with some diced red onions. \n\nThe waitress left us alone for the most part and just peeked in every once in a while to see if we were ok. It is worth a try, if you have never been before, but I will continue on my food odyssey for the best breakfast in Vegas.
1;Really dark. Very hard to see in this place. Funny part was every guest asked if they made sushi. Lol. Food was ok. I had the curry but it was more like a gravy and not curry sauce. Also had pad Thai which was good but way too too much sauce.
0;This place is horrible, went with a group of friends and as soon as we got there it was a crappy place. Being that the hotel is on the strip you would think there be an excellent upkeep but NOPE! That's not the case at all! \n\nAs soon as we parked we noticed that the hotel elevator smelled kind of funny, and didn't sound like the most secure elevator at all. We go and check in and the front desk person tells us that they'll being holding my security deposit AND the charge again but they were specific as to why (I called my bank upset and they told me that it's the hotels issue, the bank didn't have a problem releasing it).\n\nWe FINALLY get our room and we head up the elevator and notice how run down the hallways look. It looks like a hotel you'd see in a shady part of town and want to run in the other direction. Not cool. \n\nWalked into the room and OMG! The looks on our face were probably priceless. We turn  the light on to see the bathroom it looks like it wasn't cleaned properly, it honestly looks like they wiped it down really quick and moved on. We go and see the bed and we see there's a HUGE crack on the wall! I'm not even sure how it got there! \n\nThe entire experience was crappy for what I paid for and especially being that it's on the strip you would think it'd be better. \n\nMy advice, pay the extra $20-$30 to stay in a nicer place, your in vegas you deserve it!
1;So one day we're waiting on a prescription and absolutely ravenous. We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. \n\nThe place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container. \n\nI've never been so angry about a salad.
1;Mediocre food.  Green Chili Stew recommended by staff was over done and with no chicken.  Egg rolls were flavorless.  Atmosphere is good, fast service.
4;First time here, and I must say they have great pastries. You can taste the quality of  ingredients i.e the strawberries or real vanilla bean. Look forward to our next visit.
4;Great experience. So fun!!
4;Very upscale steakhouse!  The service 5 stars.  The scalloped potatoes with fresh jalapenos 5 stars.  The rib eye with bone in 5 stars. I'm taking heaven people! Oh, THE best warm butter cake.  You might die a little but definitely surface back.  \n\nPerfection.
1;Pros\n- The food was delicious\n- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch\n- Great decor\n\nCons\n- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone\n- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch\n- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves\n- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting\n- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.\n\nOverall\nMaybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting.
0;In sum - WalMart. \n\nMy girlfriend likes -- for whatever strange, twisted reason (tradition, to torture me?) -- to come to this cesspool. Alright. I purchased some car windshield wipers at another, dirtier WalMart (I'll review that gem another day) and I misplaced the receipt. I always figured that WalMart prided itself on two things: lowest prices on its subpar product lines (which is not even true, RE: lowest prices) and taking anything back for exchange (they give you a gift card).\n\nSomeone forgot to tell the CS 'ASSOCIATE'/wench that treated me like a convicted rapist/thief while she performed the exchange for me. \n\nI gave my girlfriend the gift card and said lets go. Something was wrong with their pharmacy (really typical, not atypical) so we could actually really go. \n\nWalMart. - E
4;Can't really go bad here. They know what I want when I walk in the door. Thanks girls !
1;Was it worth the 2-hour wait? The first time I came here a few years ago, I would definitely say yes.  But this time I would say, Eh, not really.  They kept running out of food.  The lines were too long outside and as well as inside the buffet that by the time you got to the food you want, they had already run out.  I went back to check and they had replaced it with an entirely different dish!  A few years ago, the food was way better and what I remember most was the crepe section.  Blueberry and whip crepe.....mmmmm, but this time it tasted yucky..what happened?? I could've sworn I saw someone eating chocolate dipped strawberries, but I never saw it at the dessert station, so I opted for the creme brulee, which I must say, is not bad.  And they ran out of Italian dressing for salad.  What the???
0;Wir waren dieses Jahr zum zweiten Mal in Vegas, Zwischenstopp auf RV-Rundfahrten (RV = Recreational Vehicle, auf Hochdeutsch Wohnmobil). Dort bietet sich f\u00fcr RVers der KOA Circus Circus Kampground an.\n\n\n Will man von dort auf den Strip (so wird landl\u00e4ufig der Las Vegas Boulevard genannt) - und wer will das in Las Vegas nicht - muss man jedes mal durch das Hotel Circus Circus ziehen, es gibt keinen anderen vern\u00fcnftigen Weg.\n\n\n Was man dort zwangsl\u00e4ufig zu sehen bekommt f\u00e4llt im Vergleich zu all den anderen Glamour-Hotels am Strip v\u00f6llig ab: Ziemlich verpl\u00fcscht, angestaubt, im Vergleich billig. Entsprechend wirkt auch das meiste Publikum - low budget tourists. Aber sicherlich kann man zum \u00dcbernachten hier Geld sparen gegen\u00fcber den wirklichen Topp-Strip-Adressen. Der Casino-Bereich - ja auch durch den muss man gehen, das ist \u00fcberall so gewollt - ist schriller, bunter und lauter als vergleichbare andere. Wenn schon gambeln, dann empfehle ich wegen des Spa\u00dffaktors den Besuch der Casinos in den besseren Hotels. Gewinnchancen oder besser die Verlustchancen sind \u00fcberall eh gleich.\n\n\n Circus Circus liegt zus\u00e4tzlich leider am Ende des Strips, also fast eine Meile vom Zentrum des Geschehens. Drum herum derzeit viele Baustellen, die ziemlich st\u00f6ren, aber m\u00f6glicherweise besseres f\u00fcr die Zukunft versprechen.
1;"Hello again my fellow Arizonians....\n\nI am back and ready to review GANDOLFOS Deli........\n\nI will start by saying the Pastrami is pretty darn good!  \n\nThe meat is seasoned well and does have that NY Pastrami taste.....however..... (and I know you knew that was coming)....\n\nThe price for the amount of meat they give is just ridiculous!\n\nI have read the reviews and if I had a groupon maybe I would have been less dissapointed.\n\nOk, a plain ole pastrami sandwich on their marble rye...which I must point out is NOTHING like good NY rye...the bread is thick and really tastes very little like rye...\nis $10.00.... and is supposed to be served with a pickle slice....didnt happen!\n\nI can only compare it to other local deli's such as Chompies, who charges the same price but the same sandwich but has twice as much meat.\n\nA REAL N.Y pastrami or corned beef sandwich is so thick with meat you can barely bite into it and just half a sandwich satisfies the biggest of appetites.\n\nThe experience started with a call to the restaurant to request they fax a menu which they were unable to do.  The young man I spoke with was not too helpful or friendly.\n\nI had to ask 3 times..... How much is a plain ole Pastrami sandwich....\n\nI asked if the cole slaw, which not included, was creamy or more vinegary...he didnt know how to answer that....  am I asking a strange question here?\n\nThis is supposed to be a deli....cole slaw is typical deli fare.... if I ask what kind...tell me, describe it to me... I am not there and cannot see it, nor did I have access to the internet to look.\n\nSeveral of us from work ordered together and none of us got our \""complimentary\"" pickle slice nor did they include the other condiments we requested.\n\nWe're talking 10 bucks for a regular sandwich....I deserve the darn pickle! lol\n\nI didnt bother to call and have a little chat as the person who had the priviledge of picking up the order mentioned the \""old man\"" we are guessing the owner? Was a grump and not the friendliest of people....so..... here I am, sharing my experience with others.\n\nI do not mind paying $10.00 for a sandwich but that sandwich better be packed with meat....or 14k gold shavings!\n\nOk, maybe it was lunch time and busy....or maybe someone was in a bad mood...or maybe the young kid just started and simply wasent fimilar with their product.... I dont know, nor do I care .....\n\nI am not getting what I paid for and that SUCKS!\n\nSo here's the 25 thousand dollar question....will I return?\n\nNope...not a chance!  \n\nI can get around the unfriendly employees and the lack of knowledge of their own menu but I will NOT pay $10.00 for a sandwich with 1/2 the meat that should be there.....\n\nI will find another good pastrami sandwich or I will wait until I visit New York again.\n\nThere may be some die hard Pastrami lovers out there who simply must have good pastrami regardless of price and to them I say... \""go for it\"".\n\nBut not this girl!  I feel I should get what I pay for and this was NOT worth the price!\n\nAgain, I can only compare it to other Deli's here in the Phoenix area or since they advertise it to be \""NY pastrami\"" I compare it to a Pastrami sandwich you get in ANY N.Y deli and GANDOLFO's looses.\n\nSo, with that being said...give it a try and see what you think.....and until you do.....\n\nBon Appetite'"
4;LOVE their nachos and chicken rolled tacos! Awesome place!
0;The mini donuts are gone. I hear they are going to bring some other people in to try and do it, but forget it.\nThe family that ran it made them best.\nIts all downhill from here, Im afraid
1;IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.\n\nEvery time I go to IKEA, I'm reminded why I hate it so much - and yet I keep returning. Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius. \n\nI think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.\n\nJust like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.\n\nThere are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.\n\nIKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced. \n\nThe only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk. \n\nI have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff. \n\nI like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here. Inexpensive poorly-crafted furniture has its applications.
0;"I feel that I have a fairly extensive vocabulary, but I am truly struggling to find a word to express the level of horrible that this show was. My tickets were free, but I feel as though I should be compensated for my time. He does a song by Bill Clinton about Monica Lewinski. Does that give you an idea of how dated and stale this material is? He does 20 minutes of Jeff Foxworthy jokes. He launches into Larry the Cable guy and half the audience was howling, \""Git er Done.\"" Most of his impersonations sounded like bad Karaoke. I'm 30 and had no idea who half the people were. Most of the jokes were pain inducing puns. The rest of the show was a constant barrage of gay jokes. He also launched into a long bit about how he was praying to god how he could spend more time with his family and after him and his wife prayed and prayed, he got the Vegas gig. Then he launched into his own power ballad. Lots of people give tickets away to this, I would question is it's even worth free. You'd have more fun watching the displays on one of the slot machines and getting free drinks. I feel a little stupider for having seen this."
3;"Heard and read about this place a lot before I finally got the chance to pop in. Came last week during my lunch break and my only complaint was not being able to indulge in happy hour and try any of the cocktails (don't think the boss would approve). So I settled for the Caprese Grilled Cheese with a side of Sweet Potato Fries and the waitress so kindly made me an iced chai latte though it was listed as a hot drink only.\n\nEverything was TASTY and the menu is huge. There are so many options to choose from - this is definitely one of those places you have to visit multiple times to not only try breakfast, lunch, AND dinner, but all the different dishes they offer for EACH of those courses. \n\nAs Arnold would say, I'll be bach.*\n\n\n\n\n*Austrian pronunciation for \""back.\"""
3;"I'm not sure why it took me so long to eat here. I've walked past Spice Island for years but never went in. Maybe its because it's surrounded by ramshackle student housing on Atwood street, but honestly don't judge by the exterior.\n\nInside is warm and inviting with low lighting and intimate tables. For drinks, there is a limited wine and beer list and also house specialty cocktails. The cocktails intrigued me the most so I went with the Gin Gin Mule (6.50) and wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe menu is extensive. Both my date and I went with noodle dishes. I went with the Singapore Rice Noodles while she ordered the \""famous\"" Pad Thai. Both hit the mark and the Pad Thai lived up to its hype. The Singapore Noodles could have been a little spicier but the friendly waitstaff brought out hot sauce which helped with the spice level.\n\nFor appetizers we went with the vegetable spring roll and the deep fried hard boiled egg. The rolls didn't stand out any more than other places around town, but the fried egg was intriguing. If you like hard boiled eggs I would recommend this variation. \n\nFor a couple drinks, apps, and two entrees the bill was somewhere between 50 and 60 dollars."
0;Ordered oysters which were very fresh. The veal chop was horribly cooked - medium throughout but completely rare towards the bone (indicates it was frozen prior to cooked). Also got the neptune platter which had an assortment of apps - it was horrible, scallops dry, tataki was dry without taste, shrimp was cooked on the outside but not the inside. This was very disappointing.\nService was horrible and waiter was very argumentative when we brought to his attention the veal chop and in fresh seafood. \nThis place is a big no. I would not recommend going to this place unless you plan to get sick from eating the horrible seafood.
3;I wasn't a big fan of wings until I had the lemon pepper wings from Wing Stop.  I love the fact that they naked fry their wings.  I don't like the heavy battered wings.  Yuck.  Back in Houston, I would eat those wings at least once a month.  Honestly, I did not like the fries the few times I had it in the beginning, but I grew quite fond of them.  There must be sugar as one of the ingredient of the seasoning or something.  Whatever it is, I dig.\n\nThe good thing about Wing Stop is that they all make the same delicious wings, from taste to texture.  I have not found a soggy wing yet...and hopefully will never!!!  Anyways, since we were on a time crunch, I put the order in online for dine-in and that was very convenient.  The website is user-friendly too.  When we arrived, our food was ready for our consumption.  The staff were nice. \n\nIf Wing Stop wasn't so far from where I live, I will definitely come back more often.
3;Love this place the icecream is amazing my only complaint is they run out of cookies so I miss out on my favorites a lot . The salted caramel with a chocolate chip cookie is crazy good.
2;busy, busy, busy.. \nthey have a convenience store, car wash, smog check station,auto shop, plus gas all in one corner location. I went for the smog check. Reasonably priced, quick and friendly service. I paid for the smog inside the convenience store which was stocked with plenty of food and snacks to put a smile on your face.
2;Just because it's not located in a 4-5 star hotel, doesn't mean it's not a great steakhouse.  The Steakhouse at Camelot is really good.  It's very nice and you definitely get the fine dining experience.  I had my favorite fish, seabass.  Even though it was years ago, I totally remember how good it was.  My husband had the rib eye and it was perfectly cooked and great too.  The service was great.  The waiter was attentive, friendly, and warm.  The ambiance is nice and comfortable too.  Candelight and big, overstuffed booths.  It is a very romantic place as well.
2;M&Ms World, located on Las Vegas Blvd, has risen to the iconic status of a tourist destination. Frankly, this is just another candy store with great brand imaging to back it up.\n\nEverything is over the top and overdone at this place- reminded me of a mini version of Hersheys Chocolate Factory. The abundance of sugar everywhere can hit you in the face, enough to give you a toothache. \n\nThey have every conceivable flavor of M&M available in the store. One of the walls is lined with M&M dispensers, with self-serve bags nearby, and one can help oneself to every possible type of M&M - minis, green, blue, raspberry, chocolate, aqua and a ton of other flavors. \n\nThey also have several M&M keep-sakes- ranging from magnets to toys, clothes, magnets, canisters and mugs, just to name a few.\nFirst, second and fourth stories sell candy and products, while the third storey houses a theatre where one can watch a 3D M&M movie, which probably is the best part of a visit to this store. \n\nNo doubts as to which audience they are targeting. This haven of sugary madness  can end up being a parent's nightmare.
2;What sets Menchies apart from the rest? Was it their circular store layout or was it their inefficient toppings bar?\n\nThey must have paid a leg and an arm to secure a pretty decent location in the swanky lot of Scottsdale Quarters.  \n\nThe one thing that can definitely be improved upon is the counter space where the toppings reside.  During my last visit, this area felt kind of congested as a slew of patrons suddenly crept up after me.  I rushed my decision on what could go with what which resulted in a mediocre, mix and mash satisfaction.  I prefer to just take my time and figure out my desired blend!\n\nThe froyo itself was comparable to other places.  I'm not a connoisseur in this particular food, but they may have had one or two unique flavors in their froyo line up.\n\nIf you are ever lurking around Scottsdale Quarters after dinner or a day of shopping and have an itch for froyo, look no more.
2;"My husband was born and raised in Pittsburgh, so after seeing this place featured on the food network, I wanted to try it because I am not from the area.\n\nAs hubby silently rolled his eyes and urged me to rethink my decision while reluctantly  giving in to my wish to go to Primanti, we drove into a crowded parking lot.\n\nUpon entering this sports type bar, the  loud environment with TVs everywhere didn't bode well with me for such a great experience.. I only came for the food, not the noise. Certainly not a place for conversation, but it appears a place for the Pittsburgh fans to hang out. \n\n  I tried the pastrami sandwich done the Primanti way, with Cole slow and fries on the sandwich. Loaded with Cole slaw and fries (not enough pastrami but they do have a double meat version if you are interested) I found the sandwich to be good, not great.\nThe Cole slow was sweet, and the fries were just greasy and so so.\n\nHubby was kind enough to not say \""I told you so\"".\n\nWent for the experience, and won't be needing to do it again."
3;Bonne nourriture, bon service, bien situ\u00e9 belle terrasse l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Un must \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.
1;I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\n\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \n\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \n\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.
0;"We stayed here this weekend. When we booked we let them know we had children. They assured us the pools would be perfect for them. Well, that could not be a bigger lie of they tried. The pool was so over packed with drunk people that the lazy river doesn't even move. One man even pushed my 8 year old under the most intense waterfall I have ever felt. Luckily my 25 year old saw her in time and pulled her out from being trapped in the current. When I told management, they said there was nothing they could do, that they have a routy crowd because of the concerts they host... So why did you originally tell me this is the perfect place for kids? Also, why does a child drowning not alert the sleeping lifeguard? Oh, and why is their response to my child drowning, \""I can comp you a couple drinks at the pool tomorrow?\"" Are you kidding? Why would I go back to pool where my child almost died? You should also know the Signature's team claims there are not a part of the MGM even though they are called The Signature at the MGM Grand. What a joke. Don't got here. Way over priced and not safe at all. \n\nAnother thing- you're only allowed to park 1 car at the hotel. They tell you if you have 2 to go park the other one at the MGM even though they claim not to be connect."
3;A delightful surprise. Small setting with funky, comfortable surroundings. Friendly staff, excellent Fentiman's ginger beer, fresh spring mix with good balsamic vinaigrette, salami and roasted veggie sandwich. Just the thing for lunch.
0;I work at an Outback in Westminster, CA and was in Vegas with some coworkers when we decided to check out what Vegas's Outback had to offer. To say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement. The food was great, just what we're used to, but the service was awful. Or at least our server was. Joshua seemed to have write us off immediately. We hadn't even ordered drinks and he already seemed to hate us. He was completely rude and unattentive throughout our meal. We all work in a restaraunt and were willing to understand that everyone has rough nights but then another one of his tables were seated right next to us and were quickly greeted with a smile and friendly conversation. To put it simply, we were confused. In the end, he didn't get the best tip and we concluded that he had discriminated against us because of our age range. He was too quick to assume that we were just young kids drunk in Vegas. We knew we were right when we saw the surprise and regret on his face when we informed him that we all work at Outback. Anyways, if you're planning on going here and are seated with Joshua, I suggest you request another server.
1;The patio is beautiful, filled with plants , trees, and waterfalls everywhere. It's a relaxing environment.\nSo our waiter was freaking annoying and gave us the worst service ever. I mean we were sitting waiting to order for 15 minutes!!!! mind you that there were about 3 other tables at that time (12:30pm) He really sucked, forgot our drinks, our food came out like 50 minutes later, took him about 20 mins to give us the check, we spent like 2.25 hours eating!! It was soo annoying, his loss right?? I think we gave him about 4$ in tip. \n   The food however was ok. I got the chicken salad my cousin got pizza and the mango salad.  First off, they have amazing bread and butter, the bread is toasted and it already has butter on it!! yummm!\nMy chicken salad was ok, nothing special except it was expensive for the quantity that I got, about 16 bucks. The pizza had a crap load of cheese everywhere, eewww! Her mango salad, was kinda good but would of been better if the balsamic sauce had flavor. It was just plain vinegar and oil and they did not have any other type of dressing.\nI want to give 3  stars just for the decor, but horrible service ruined it! Bye bye aroma!
2;Since my kids went to ASU I have wanted to try this place meaning the restaurant because there are many locations.   I know your suppose to go at 3am not 3pm but I got there. Shared taquitos with guacamole and had my first Horchada.  I usually don't like these kinda drinks but I enjoyed it anyway.  I would go back at 3am or 3pm .
0;My wife and I had lunch here and were very disappointed in the food and prices. I don't mind spending $40 on 2 dishes of good mexican food but the good we got was horrible. The grilled fish tacos were super small, fishy, and just bland. The sides of rice were too salty and the beans were dry and looked liked yesterdays beans. The chicken salad also was bland and the dressing was just horrible as well. I was also disappointed on the 3 salsas that came with the chips. My local senor fish has way better food and salsas. \n\nThe only thing the was nice was the upper deck seating and the service. You can do way better for $50 after taxes and drinks.
3;What a gem! The best part is that they rent any of their fabulous items for one night for just $15. Gorgeous costume jewelry and unique items.
0;really sad.  really small.  I am used to farmers markets in other cities.  I try not to compare but cant help it when it takes a whole 5 minutes to navigate the whole market.  an awful lot of non local products at way to high a price.  I did run into a local resident I met when I moved to phoenix 1 1/2 months ago and turns out it was his first time here.  also his last he said.  I am also an animal lover and a crowded market is no place for dogs and non supervised children.  the lawyers would have a great time with it.  save your hard earned money and go to sprouts.
2;"I have only been to Cafe Rio once. Wait, that isn't quite accurate... I have only EATEN at Cafe Rio once, at this location. I tried going to another location a while back while on my lunch break and ended up walking out due to a very long, slow moving line. \n\nAllison S. and I were planning on getting some take out and decided to give the new neighborhood Cafe Rio a try. When we walked in the line was insane, but for how many people that were waiting to order and pay it moved fairly quickly. It took us about 25 minutes total to get through the line, order and pay. It was also quite loud, which made hearing the employee while ordering difficult. \n\nI ended up ordering a grilled chicken salad. Not a fan of places like Cafe Rio that charge more for \""fire grilled chicken\"" versus \""chicken\"" but I still paid the extra buck to have fire-grilled chicken. As previously mentioned, the ordering process was chaotic so when asked, I said I'd take everything on the salad. Total damage for the salad only was a little over $10. A bit steep, but the serving was quite large. \n\nThe food itself was good. Not great. Comparable to Chipotle (which I am not a huge fan of either) or Qdoba (which I prefer to this). That said, I still plan on returning to try other menu items.  Hopefully by the time I return some of the 'new business in the area' hype has died down.\n\nP.S. For whatever reason, this location isn't showing up on the website, so online ordering is not currently possible."
3;"Just a mini Update this time as Jackie R. & Mike C. joined me for lunch here today.  The only changes to report from last time was that they have a new Mongolian BBQ chef, but he cooked up my plate of good stuff just fine.  (I like how they cut up the 3 meats like french fries...  works well.)  Another nice touch was chives right there by the delicious Sweet & Sour and Won Ton soups to add in.\n\nOne gripe to \""air.\""  (Pun\u00bf)  They aren't offering paper towels in the bathrooms but only those nasty blowers.  I stood there for a while with it blowing cold air on my hands and then finally wiped them on my shirt.  THEN, how was I supposed to get out of the second door, back into the dining room, without getting more germs on them than ever from pulling the handle open?  Shirt?  Fine... now it's wet, pulled out & wrinkled!\n\nMinus 1 Star from an otherwise excellent lunch buffet offering up 120 tasty items today, plus sauces and dressings.     :-)\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet now $9.39/$8.46 Sr."
2;I can't really knock the place but nothing really jumps out and says amazing either. \n\nI have been here multiple times, often for sporting events. The food is good but not fantastic, however it is better than most sports bars. I have had the shepherds pie a few times and I like it. It's a full meal and exactly what you want in a shepherds pie, nothing fancy just the simple classic meal. I have also had the spinach artichoke dip which is pretty much your standard spinach artichoke dip.\n\nThe one of the big things that has this at a 3 star not a 4 star is the lack of pitchers of beer. It's insane that a sports bar doesn't do pitchers of beer. Also during PPV's they don't do any free refills on soda, I really think they should give at least 1 if not 2. Service here has been fair at best. Some have been above average but most have been average at best. I understand it can be busy during sports events but even when there hasn't been anything they haven't been fantastic.
1;I had raw fish on the veggie with rice. It was above average but it is definitely over price. With $17 per portion, there was not a lot of raw fish in there. The waiter and waitress are very slow and complained about their tips. It took them about 10 to 15 mins to get us our check. I didn't feel like giving them a good tip either. \n\nI always want to try the place but we went into there on one of the Sats when they had lunch sign out. After we went in, they said that they don't have the lunch special. \nI feel like being cheated. Will not be back.
1;"This is an update to my full review below.  \n\nI have been chided by yelp message -- probably from the owner or his friend -- that it is OK to call a tortilla dish \""rarebit.\""  My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get, no luck. I moved here from Britain. When I saw the tortilla labeled \""rarebit\"" my reaction was: This place doesn't know what they are doing. Admittedly, the item on the menu labeled \""spanish\"" is far weirder."
0;I've been to this cafe rio several times and although the food isn't great, it's a closer drive than the cafe rio on Stephanie. Most times, their rice is hard, beans are undercooked or just look like they have been sitting out for days. Even the area where they make the food looks super unsanitary. Today I waited 30 minutes in line only to get to order and find out they're out of pork and chicken. If you're going to be out of something, you should at least tell the people waiting in line! I wouldn't suggest this location. I'd rather take the drive for better food and service.
1;The pizza was bad. The problem begins with ordering. The menu gives a few choice of sauce plus a lot of topping. It does not offer any guidance how to create a good pizza. A few signature pizza on the menu would be a welcomes improvement. \n\nThe price adds up quickly with multiple toppings.   I would recommend any fast food joints over this place.
1;Yelp  must be broken - this was barely edible. \n\nI can't possibly understand how the average ranking is so high for this place.  Honesly, I over-ordered so that I could get a sampling of a few different things.  Even with that shotgun approach I could not find any of the four dishes that was worth eating even half the portion. \n\nIs this really the best Chinese food in town??  It definitely feels like you are in a restaurant in China when you are at a table but.... not when it comes to the food.
0;"My daughter was here 3 days. Each day when I came to pick her up after being gone 10 hours her coat was still on! Nobody paid enough attention to remove it after 10 hours!!!\n\nThe 3rd day I picked her up. I looked through the peep window. The Hispanic  \""teacher\"" was holding one Hispanic child on her hip. My daughter  (black)\nwas standing right beside the teacher crying her head off, face red snot running, scared. I could tell she had been crying for a while cuz her skin was blotchy. My daughter was looking up at the teacher hands out stretched to get her attention the teacher was looking at the wall completely ignoring my daughter. I flipped my shit!!! I asked how long she had been crying the woman shrugged and said oh about 10 minutes. 10 minutes!!! I said lady you couldn't run in place for 10 minutes but you got my daughter here crying for 10 minutes ignoring her!!! Even 3 minutes is a long time when a kid is crying upset like that. The kid on her hip was not crying or in distress at all. So why not put that kid down and try to calm my daughter down??? The stupid bitch. I reported this location to the people that investigate this stuff but I never got a follow up about what they did. \nThe cameras don't record at all! So they are useless. And if something like this were to happen to your kid there would be no proof of it. \nI certainly do not recommend this location for any children!"
2;Growing up in Germany eating swiss and belgian chocolate, having traveled to bruges and spending an entire day gouging on chocolate and washing it down with a good trippel, I feel I have a good basis of comparison.\n\nImagine my excitement when I heard about this chocolate transplant, directly from the source.\n\nI personally feel that the highlight of your visit here is going to be the chocolate dipping experience. I think it equals if not surpasses anything that the melting pot has to offer. White, chocolate, and dark chocolate terrines wait expectantly for you to dip a variety of interesting morsels into them. Not just your plebeian strawberry and bananas, but a smorgasboard of salami, salty potato chips, cheetos, cheese curds, mangos, and more. Enjoy this with a traditional summer drink, affogato, which is espresso poured over gelato.\n\nAs for the chocolate offerings themselves...after taking home a box of four ranging from marzipan to amaretto - I was grievously disappointed at the taste and texture of the chocolate. In fact it was so lackluster and did nothing to awaken in me any sense of nostalgia, that I did not even finish them. For a chocolate lover, this was a surpising moment.  A sad day indeed.
0;The service in this place is like freakin molasses, for real. \n\nWe were given a buzzer when we asked for a table for two, which was fine, it was a saturday night and we figured it was pretty packed. Waited around for about 10 minutes then got buzzed and seated. The place was totally NOT packed. There were probably 5 open tables and no one being seated. A few of the tables still had a bunch of trash on and i didn't see anyone going to clean it. \n\nOnce we were seated we took a look at the menu. We decided to just stick with water for our drinks since we were getting a sundae. We opted for the Jackpot Sundae at 14 bucks because it was a combo of chocolate (which my boyfriend likes) and strawberry (which I like). \n\nWaited waited waited. It literally took them 15 to 20 minutes to come to us and they never even took our drink orders yet. We were seriously on the verge of leaving. There was a table of 3 next to us that came in 10 minutes after we did and we could tell they were waiting too. We decided that if they took their orders first, we were just going to up and leave.Tthey didn't, so they got us to stay for a while longer, but they did take their order RIGHT AFTER ours. \n\nWe were never asked if we needed anything or how we were doing, the waitress never even refilled our waters. \n\nWe waited about 20 more minutes for the sundae. It was freakin' ridiculous! I have a feeling they must be like this all the time. We noticed 4 cups of french fries in the kitchen that was just sitting there for 10 minutes, I hope they don't just give that to people when it gets ordered. \n\nThe sundae finally came. Half melted. Of course, they brought out everyone else's order at the same time. Are they really that lazy? They just had to wait to finish everyone's order from different tables to bring it out at the same time instead of making a few trips? The sundae's were seriously dripping because they must've been sitting and melting for a while. \n\nThe only thing they managed to bring in a very speedy manner was the check, of course. She pretty much gave that to us right after she handed over the sundae. So annoying. I should've ordered a soda or something just so she'd have to take it back and change it. \n\nThe sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service. It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all. They should really be more selective with their staff, I honestly don't know what they were thinking. \n\nI am NOT coming back.
0;The first time my family went here, we had an awesome time. Good time with good company. We played volleyball until midnight. We had such a good time, we came back the next night. But the 2nd time wasn't as charming. When we got there and all of the volleyball courts we taken so we were just waiting for one to clear up. Finally, when we got a chance to get on a court around 10:00. The lights turned off, which isn't a big deal because we played in the dark the first time. Then a blonde girl (not sure if she's apart of VBGB staff because she wasn't wearing uniform) barged on the courts and disrespectfully, kicked us off the court. Someone probably pissed in her cereal that morning because she had the biggest attitude. Which started to annoy us because she was so rude about. But not a big deal, we let it slide and got off the courts but we were confused because we were able to play volleyball on the courts until midnight the day before. But no, it doesn't end there. She went around to all of the servers, talking *excuse my language* shit about us. That's when lines have been crossed. This place has so much potential but unfortunately, staff members needs a lot of attitude adjustment. Rude service calls for rude customers. And for the blonde girl that disrespected my family, well I hope your day is at least a little better than your personality (:
0;No. Just, no. I can't speak for the quality of the teacher because I couldn't hear how she interacted with my 2.5 year old. WHY couldn't I hear her you ask? Because I was behind glass AWAY from her when she hadn't ever had a swim lesson before! I didn't even get to take her in and meet the teacher. The teacher knew NOTHING about her but her name and I didn't even get to tell her about her anxiety. She had her doing things she had never heard of and she was terrified.
4;I've had good times and not so good times here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad by far. Last friday I went for happy hour with  a total of 7 friends (one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table). Arriving at 5:30, I couldn't believe how packed it was! No recession here! I love the music they play- it's just feel-good, trendy pop, but it puts me in to mood to eat, drink and be merry! \n\nI always get the Cowboy roll- which is spicy tuna with cucumbers, spicy sauce and scallions and it just does it for me. For the first time I tried a friend's chimichanga roll and must say that I am now a huge fan! It was even spicier than the cowboy and like a mini party in my mouth! My other fav thing here is the calamari! Its lightly breaded and comes with the best tangy sauce that I always want to keep for later even though I don't know what I would use it for. I'm just a sauce hoarder. And at happy hour an order is only 4 bucks! Beat that? I dont think so. And the specialty rolls are only 8 bucks!\n\nSushi brokers always treats me well and I leave full, buzzed and happy. Just get there early to get a seat for happy hour!
1;Overhyped, overpriced and now host to one of the ugliest structures in the world, it is FREMONT STREET.\n\nOnce the hub of Vegas, Fremont Street is now relegated to the status of carnival attraction despite the heroic, if mostly unsuccessful, attempts to attract visitors.\n\nFrom the let down of a light show (occasionally they break out a good one) to the greedy and mostly untalented street performers (I appreciate good ones but really how much talent does it take to dress up like a transformer or superman), Fremont Street Experience is simply a means to an end.  The addition of the Long Bar has only made drinks more expensive.  It is next to impossible to find the inexpensive tables near the freemont street entrance anymore.\n\nSo how do they bring people to Freemont.  Apparently it is by building the world's largest, and ugliest, slot machine to double up the zipline availability (and cost).  While many unsuspecting twentysomethings will give it a whirl, it is just another eyesore coming to vegas.\n\nWhy two stars?  Well there are still some gems on Fremont and some new places that are worth a go pop up.  Plus it is still cheaper than the strip and more of a party atmosphere.\n\nBest of all, they do have good stage shows especially during the concert series.
1;I've been coming to this location for several years. I used to come almost once a week after work, when the late night specials were great. Now I remember why I don't come anymore. The late night food specials suck compared to what they used to be here and suck compared to any other late night dining option. Service is hit or miss.
1;Too expensive. Food is alright. I rather go to either Bellagio or Rio.
0;"Good food, but horrible, stuffy and pretentious atmosphere.  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service.  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation.  When we said no, she huffed and acted very put off.  Once we were seated, the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal.  Have dined here multiple times.  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy, \""wealthy grandmother\"" like atmosphere any longer."
1;"I finally got around to trying this place. It's nearby, but I always find myself at either Noodlehead, BRGR or Chipotle. My boyfriend's parents were in town so I wanted to take them someplace a little nicer. We went to Spoon last time they were in town, so we decided to give Dinette a try.\n\nWe arrived at 9:30pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was mostly empty, there were 3 other occupied tables in the entire restaurant. \n\nThey were out of 2 dishes that we were interested in, the salmon salad and one of the pizzas. We ended up ordering the following items:\n-Grilled Shishito Peppers: Came w/ goat cheese and fried almonds. Yummy! I would say this was my favorite dish, wish the size was larger. $9 for 7 small peppers, 5 chunks of cheese and 7 almonds. FYI, the peppers weren't spicy at all.\n-Butternut Squash Soup: I didn't try this but it smelled good. I was surprised at how small the portion was for $8.\n-Grilled Romaine Hearts: Again, I didn't try this but the boyfriend's parents each ordered their own, and they described the dish as having \""interesting flavors.\"" \n-Roasted Broccolini Pizza: Also had feta, olives, tomatoes and fresh mozarella. Meh. Very sparse toppings. Flavors didn't go together as well as I had hoped.\n-Chorizo Sausage Pizza: Also had tomatoes, and I forgot what else. Taste was slightly above average, but again, very sparse toppings. I think there were probably 7 or 8 very small pieces of sausage on the entire pizza.\n\nService was mediocre at best. The server was friendly but he was pretty absentminded...or maybe he just didn't care that much about doing a good job? He had to be flagged down to refill our water pitcher even though he had walked by our table and the restaurant was not busy, he poured water into my boyfriend's cup but not mines even though mines was empty, he brought us red pepper flakes for our pizza when we were halfway done w/ eating them, etc. Also, the cooks thanked another party for coming as they exited the door, but did not say one word to us...huge pet peeve of mines. We had still tipped 20%, but it was not deserved.\n\nI don't think we will be back, we will stick with Spoon next time we are looking for a nicer restaurant in the area."
1;The cocktails are great and so is the chopped salad. That's it. Had two entrees and an app and they were just ok. Waiter was so sweet but honestly I cannot believe how many people don't have good taste and gave this place 5 stars. Next time I go, I will sit at bar, have some drinks and a chopped salad and be done.
1;this restaurant has great food.. tacos are amazing. but the one thing that i keep coming back for is the corn on the cob (mexican street style). its so amazing. you cant go wrong with anythibg on the menu.. \n\nthere is one small complaint i do have though. yesterday i had gone there to pick up lunch for my office. all the food was set up and i had paid for everything. the lady who had rang me up.. first asked if i wanted a bag for my large order. she then told me to wait a munute while she had to put ice in the ice machine and i understand that maybe that had beem something that needed to get filled.. but couldnt she have had asked someone else from the back to do it for her?  instead it took her an additional 10 mins before i got my actual order packed. i had asked her and the other guys in the back for my order. but i wasnt awknowledged. i then asked for the manager and she said she was... this kind of service is unacceptable. she didnt say sorry for the long wait or anything. needless to say.. if this one particular employee is working.. i will not be eating there and im gonna be telling everyone i know about it.\n\nother than this bad experience ... food is great nd service is ok.
2;Good Shuttle service from the airport at the Southwest terminal. Its the only one that is not cash-only so you can swipe it. The British guy standing around was pretty rude, but the driver was nice. As a rule of thumb, I just take *any* airport shuttle on the return to the airport that just happens to be at the Hotel when I'm leaving.
4;AMAZING. It is tradition for me to visit this fantastic restaurant each time I visit Las Vegas. The kobe beef burgers are FLAWLESS, as is the yellowtail sashimi. The desert platters are UNBELIEVABLE. I honestly have no complaints.
4;I went here with my husband on a date night!! Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The place is decorated very nicely and has a modern touch to it. The food was very flavorful, it literally makes you fall in love with it by firing all your tastebuds. t's a little on the expensive side but it's well worth the price. Compared to other high end restaurants the portions here are pretty big.\n\nThe ambiance was very romantic with candle lights and all, I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date.\n\nThe only aspect that was a little lacking was probably the service, but the food was so great that I was happy they weren't bothering me too much.
1;the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated.
1;staff was friendly and so was the crowd, but it was a special crowd.  If I'd been booking a hotel would have spend an extra 20-30 and stayed somewhere nicer.   This is a cheap hotel/extended stay and you get what you pay for.
0;In hindsight, I wish I researched this before booking. As things turned out, my experience is NOT an isolated incident with this business if you research other travel sites. \n\nMany of our family members booked a mini family vacation here for a July weekend several months in advance DIRECTLY from their web site. After getting a confirmation and putting down a deposit($230/night) for our reservation, we thought that everything was set. What else could go wrong?\n\nWhen we arrived around 3pm check in time after tired 9hr drive. My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve?  When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! \n\nAs I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day. I overhear many other guests that were just as pee off  as we were after getting bump from the hotel. \n\nAfter pleading with them to provide us a room(didn't care if its down or up scale) so we can stay with the family without staying 3 miles away from the strip, they still wouldn't give us our room. All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. \n\nIn hindsight, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins.  \n\nWhat ever happen to  business integrity? Back in the days when you get a confirmation after making a deposit, its pretty much a done deal that you'll get your room.   If you don't mind rolling the dice, book this place at your own risk because of a confirmation don't mean anything.\n\nIn the future, I'll have 2nd thought about staying at any MGM properties. Definitely Mandalay Bay is no longer a place I'd stay. \n\nGood luck to all that plans to stay at this place.
0;They stop and give me a ticket and a hot female can just get off. That's bs phx pd. Kiss my you know what.
3;"Almost a year to the first time we visited Razz's, we went back in company with another couple.  Stellar meal.  DH and I shared an appy of squash blossom stuffed with cheese, lobster and crab.  Absolutely delish and it was brought to our table already on separate plates, so DH and I did not have to pass the small appetizer plate back and forth for bites. Very thoughtful.  Our DC's got a spicy Indonesian noodle bowl called something like Bai Mai Goreng or something---who cares?  Our friend was kind enough to share a bite and it was outstanding.  Could easily have eaten a bowl of it as an entree.  And speaking of entrees,  And speaking of entrees---we two ladies got the duck breast  with lingonberry sauce and a  house blend farro.  Duck was cooked perfectly, just a hint of pinkness and not a bit dry an the fat beautifully rendered.  I didn't love the farro---a bit crunch for me---but my fellow duck-eater loved her's!  The gentlemen, respectively, got the chicken scalloppini and the steak special, and there were a lot of groans of delight emitting from that end of the table.  The art on the walls is remains kind of weird, but still a lovely, intimate ambiance and our service was quite good,  Razz's definitely will remain on our \""re-visit\"" list!"
3;Big airport with long taxis into your gate if you're unlucky (which I was).  Surly TSA folks who don't like the human phlegm cavorting through their airport.  That's the bad.  The good?  People watching equals a 10+ for sure!  Warmer than Cincinnati in the winter (that was easy).  Fun to fly in at night as you can see Vegas' lights screaming at you in the middle of all that blackness from at least 100 miles out, and that's a once in a lifetime experience (or is it?)  \n\nSo very many droopy heads inside this airport though!  Looks like a lot of you flyers have a case of the Mondays!  Extraordinary numbers and degrees of those pesky hangovers are apparent at this airport.  Side note: I've never seen so many women, young and old, go through an airport in velvet pajama bottoms.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a Vegas anomaly I suppose....\n\nWhy in the name of God would I give Las Vegas International McCarron Airport 4 stars? Slot machines everywhere, at every terminal food court and even randomly placed in otherwise nondescript terminal walkways!  Screw USA Today and a Starbucks latte at 515 AM, let's hit some more slots, people!
0;I have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!
3;Nordstrom is most convenient department store across the States.   I always stop there and check it out when I go down to the States.\n\nI like to shop at Nordstrom coz of their friendly service and casual atmosphere in the store.  From cosmetic to clothing, they have good selection and nice customer service.\n\nSurprisingly quiet on weekday at Nordstrom, I just saw few customers on cosmetic floor.   That's ok. I liked to enjoy private sales service and atmosphere.
3;Looking for authentic Mexican food? Then this is the place... that you should not order from.  But! I still love Burrito Drive because it is fast and easy.  Usually I just create my own burrito, but if you're feeling sleezy, you can always try the White Trash Burrito, which features American delicacies such as Spam and Velveeta.
4;Go Cupcakes! Cupcrazed, I love you so much I want to marry you. You have a cute store, you have cushy nooks to sit in, you have pretty little dishes to eat off of, you are in sweet little Baxter, and your cupcakes are PERFECT.  My daughter had the red velvet (moist, chocolatey and the icing had the great sweet/sour taste of the cream cheese that it should). I had the lemon cupcake, which was nice and lemony and wonderifically moist.  I will make the drive from Charlotte to visit you again!
1;"A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.\n\nFirst of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.\n\nThe Pros:\nAYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)\n\nThe Cons:\nThe lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.\n\nOverall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :("
3;I'm rating Uncle Sam's on their cheesesteaks alone. Sadly, I'm one of those girls who loves her greasy, heart stopping food. Four stars for the cheesesteaks, hands down. \n\nTheir prices are extremely decent for the monstrosity of a sandwich they give you. Go for the cheesesteak with mushrooms, cheese, and pepperoncinis. Make it extra peppers. So good.  \n\nI've only taken out, never eaten in, but the place is always packed at night. I've had wings once or twice, and I have definitely had better. Stick with the cheesesteaks and you'll be alright.
4;I love this place!  I have been coming here for  18 months or more and is still one of my favoriate places for lunch.  The food is fresh and cooked to perfection.  I have tried all three chicken options but like the grilled the best.  My little girl loves the mac and cheese and french fries.  Service is always top notch.  Portion size is just right and for the price, a great value. Keep up the great work!
3;Jedd and crew were very helpful in getting a solid start to a great bass system.\nQuality product and any questions I had they were more than informative, after all, spending a couple grand on a stereo is quite a big step these days. You want to know you are getting quality.\nA word of advice to all who go here and are considering a large purchase. In house warranty,it's 50$ for piece of mind. Don't make a mistake by passing on it, you never know. Just look at the guy above..perfect example
0;"24 Dec 2012     actually a 1/2 of a star   for business practices.                                                                                                                                                     I been a member of La Fitness since 1999.  I now live Citrus Heights CA.  La Fitness does not have any gyms here.  I'm been trying to cancel my membership since November.  the first person told me I could do it through via web get  letter of cancellation and  mail it . I am having problems getting on to the La Fitness website.  I just called again to yesterday 23 Dec 2012  and the young lady told me the manager is not there to speak to me and the  ONLY and I quote \""the only way you can cancel your membership is to go into any La Fitness gym\"" .       I'm in Northern CA , I can not spend  three hundred dollars to fly back into Phoenix AZ, rent a car and go to the LA Fitness to cancel my membership.  So I'm waiting for the manager to call me.  I have already written to the BBB, because you can not charge someone who has relocated and ask them to stop by a LA fitness to cancel their membership.  please   That is bad business practices.   I will promise to keep this up to date.  As soon as I hear any info I will let you know. \n\nThe one thing I would love La Fitness to do and supply cleaning spray and paper towels to wipe down equipment.\n\n\n I will not change this rating until I know La Fitness has cancelled my account and is not charging my account."
0;We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID
1;GREAT food.  awesome bar w/huge fish tank & gimmicks.  i like the \nbuilt-in pro bass shop.  fun/cool casino & staff.  extremely nice/comfortable rooms.  the bad thing: it's several miles from vegas & no free shuttle anymore. also, i used to get comped rooms & the new person in charge of offering them wants about $30/nite sun-thurs.  a 30 spot & isolated from the strip w/no shuttle?--Meh.
3;I typically don't like to spend $15 on a hamburger all that much, but when you are on the strip and are going to spend too much anyway, this place is a solid choice.  The hamburgers there are pretty damn good, and big!  The fries are bomb, but the onion rings did not impress.  They were batter rings it seemed:   too much batter and not enough onion.
4;Great hole in the wall restaurant. Recently remodeled so it fits a lot more guests. Our favorites here are the Bulgogi burrito, tostadas and the tacos. The portions are huge and the prices are cheap!! They're always so welcoming and friendly, this is why we always come back when we crave fusion.
2;I came here for breakfast and have been wanting to come here for a while.  Its a bit of a drive for me, but I finally decided it was time to go.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience and enjoyed my time here.  Its a fast casual type resturant, where you walk in, place your order at the counter, and they walk the food out to you.  They seem to have a nice selection of food, mostly breakfast with some lunch items.  \n\nI went for breakfast, and wanted to keep it simple.  I ordered two eggs over medium, with toast and potatos.  I found the toast to be a bit dry, and a bit to dark for me.  Usually I like my toast a little lighter with butter on it, but that was not the case.  Also, I found the potatoes to be a bit bland and boring.\n\nI will probably be back, but was not blown away by this place.  I rated it high becuase I think overall its a good place, and the food isnt that half bad.
1;Aside from the water being spilled on my coworker, the food was ok. Nothing spectacular really. Eh, they could have at least comped their food for spilling those glasses on them.
3;From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we all were satisfied. My son and I had the New York strips which were cooked perfect and very delicious. My wife had the salmon and it was unbelievable. My daughter said the chicken sandwich she had was the best she had ever had.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive without being interruptive and in your face. To top off the evening, the dessert was to die for.\n\nIf I had to find something wrong it was that when we arrived, the background music was too loud but as more and more people came in it leveled off.\n\nAll in all it was a great dining experience.
2;We found Bronze Cafe in one of the gay magazines in Las Vegas and wanted to be supportive.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. He was very patient will I was trying to make my selection. I settled on a curried quinoa salad and while it was flavorful it was dry as dust. Just a suggestion: this one would be excellent if it was a little moist and easy to swallow.\n\nThe Bronze Cafe is nestled in the center of the LGBTQ center here and I'm always wiling to offer my support. It just wasn't the stellar experience I was expecting. I'm just very happy to know that Nevada is more blue than red and we can probably thank Las Vegas for that.
4;"I am currently trying to find a new gym home. I'm not into the lvac type gyms. I prefer specialty gym because they are tough work outs. I visited camp fit force during the \""share the love\""(free classes were offered all week). I attended a Tuesday and Thursday class. Those happened to be the wod workouts. I do have experience with crossfit,  circuit training, and boxing.\nOmar is the greatest.  He has a great personality and really knows what he's talking about. The gym is very welcoming. I have one more gym to try out before I make a decision, but I'm thinking that the decision has been made.  Fit force, you know WHOOT!!!!!"
1;"Corporate,  are you listening??  Although I admit, I love your product, what the hell is going on in this store? \nWhile I was waiting (26 minutes) for my order for two, THREE different customers came back in to say their order was wrong or incomplete.  Laura, your counter lady, handled it as best she could (2 stars are for her only)   I believe all the orders originally were through the drive thru. I have been to this store many times and have only gotten lucky to have a good experience two or three times. \nI refuse to go to the drive thru anymore, the order is either wrong or the chicken is extremely small. At 5 in the evening, you should not be out of ANYTHING, especially your most popular chicken choices. \n\nThis location is run worse than the VA. Heads must roll; it's the only way to get right with us. \n\nPs. Please keep Laura. She's full of personality and quick."
2;I love the vietnamese sandwiches, but the downside is that the bread they use is always hard . So when I take bites I take hard chews of all bread and end up eating most of the meat last. Their bread is good, tasty, and soft when it's fresh. I wish they would serve the freshest bread for the sandwiches too! Their thai tea boba is deliscious! Milky, smooth, and sweet! Just the way I like it. They also have free wifi and a very contemporary feel to the interior decoration. \n\nIf you're looking to get a kick start on vietnamese lingo, I'd suggest to hang out at this spot and learn about the numbers in vietnamese! Their service machine calls out your ticket in english and vietnamese! So when you're hanging around lee's definitely count with the service machine, and I guarantee you you'll be a vietnamese counting guru with in minutes!
1;Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner at this restaurant as we had never been to either the Stratosphere or the restaurant before. I was so looking forward to a wonderful evening with one of my bestest friends and my wonderful husband. Unfortunately the experience as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a combination of the Management of the facility as well as another diner in the restaurant that honestly I wish I was able to confront for ruining such a wonderful evening.\n\nWithout letting that situation put a bias on my review of their food, it was mediocre at best and seriously over-priced for what we had tried to consume before being rudely interupted by the manager. It seems that one of the other diners near us were offended by our laughter and enjoyment, enthusiasm for being together, and certain words that were spoken at my table. The manager then approached our table, looked at me directly and asked that we refrain from these activities immediately. Now please keep in mind I spent well over 200 dollars for dinner and had not even been served as yet. I promptly requested to know whom had made such a request of us, as I intended to embarass and humiliate them as they had done to me. Maybe not the best approach but honestly - who in their right mind is so narcassistic to believe that they are allowed to go out in Public then mandate that the Public behave in the way they deem they should? If you are so easily offended by others, stay at home and don't ever leave.\n\nBack to dinner, I gathered my things, my 25 dollar valentine's day dinner picture, my BFF and left my husband to deal with getting our dinner to go. We had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 cards and some cash he wanted to give towards the dinner with the intent of giving cash to the waitress after the transaction as a tip (we prefer tipping in cash as we believe the servers are not taxed on this and get to keep more of it - if that makes sense). I am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provided was for as I think he had wanted to get change from it but it seems the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollars of that cash. Funny, she was going to receive a much larger tip than 20 dollars as she was excellent, it was her manager that was the jerk, but just taking the money and not returning it, allowed us to assume thats all she thought she deserved and we did not offer anything more. \n\nAll in all, as I indicated, the food really wasn't all that compared to other places we have been to with similar offerings. The price was not fitting of the quality of food, the service was excellent but that last little action was uncalled for. The manager needs a class in people skills and the only real redeeming quality this place has is that it sits at the top of the Stratosphere, spins and provides a nice view of the strip when your table finally gets there. If it was just an observation deck with a bar it could have been a much better place to go. Overall I was pretty bummed that this place seems to get a lot of hype but really is disappointing in the end.
1;Very disappointing.  Great food but absolutely glacial service and microscopic portions. My waiter would disappear for 15 min at a time on at least four occasions. Dinner took twice as long as it should have.  I had to go eat a real dinner after this disaster because I was still so hungry. But what little they did serve me was excellent. So this is another case of the front of house failing the back of house. Management needs to apologize to the chefs. When I let the matre d know how disappointed I was he said he was sorry. Not as sorry as I was picking this dog for my last dinner In town (second to last because I had to go get food after this starvathon)
0;Went there the other night to watch the Yankees-Angels playoff game. Sat at an open small table. It was like I was invisible. I waited 15 minutes with people constantly flying by until a waiter actually made eye contact. Ordered a beer and waited another fifteen minutes for a menu... still no beer. It wasn't until I expressed my disatisfaction with the waiter that I finally received my beer. THE PLACE WAS NOT THAT BUSY. Tried to get my bill after my beer and lousy artichoke dip and finally gave up leaving a $10 bill on the table.
3;This place is one of my favorite places for mexican food! Their seafood is very very good! I usually order the shrimp tacos and shrimp enchiladas. I've had other things listed on the menu, however here is the place to quality mexican seafood.
1;Did a trade for a timeshare week.....HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!  They Claim these are Suites.... not even close.  Can you say False Advertizing.. ?? \n\nTiny rooms but clean... Maybe one step up from MOtel 6 as far as conditono of the rooms.... but... their daily rates are higher than Motel 6..  \n\n$4.95 per hour for Wi Fi.
2;Came here before a Coyotes game. Friendly staff and quick seating. Portions are good but over priced $$$... somewhat expected that being so close to the arena.
2;Decided to make another review about this place. My fiance kept telling me that he wants to go here so I decided to give it another shot since the last time I went here it was on those busy weekends. Went here around 10pm on a wednesday. Finally got seated right when we got there. The waitress was nice, but it looked like she hated working there and she only stopped by our table 4 times. First time was to get us drinks, second time to deliver our food, third time because my chicken ceasar wrap was sooo dry and I had that before so it didn't taste like that the first time I tried it, the fourth time was just to deliver the check. Haha some service. Food was cheap though, and finally got it faster then usual. I recommend coming here late at night on a weekday because this place can be hell fridays - sundays. Unless you have the patience of a saint.
4;I love stationary. I love this shop.\n\nIt's amazing how many stationary shops there are in the city, and I think I love them all....but Scribbler is definitely in my top 3. It's full of beautiful people and beautiful things. They have great office sets - matching folders, pens, staplers and punchs. What's more, they have masculine sets too! So if pink floral patterns aren't your thing lads, they have really nice mens things too!\n\nI'm like Sam C, I've found myself giggeling at the cards too. They're brilliant! If I need a card or wrapping paper for someone special I'll come to a shop like Scribbler - what's not to love?!
4;I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.\n\nI'm very satisfied with my experience with them.
3;I had a ticket to see Cirque du Soleil's O this evening, which is at the Bellagio. \n\nI had supper at Fix Restaurant & Bar, which is also in the Bellagio.\n\nI was seated in the front near the open area.  It was great for people watching but since it's close to the slot machines and people are allowed to smoke in the casino, I could smell cigarettes and cigars :(\n\nI wasn't overly hungry so ordered wings.  There were 13 in my order (they were all drummettes) and they were excellent!  The sauce had just the right amount of heat and they were really tender and juicy.  I'd get them again. \n\nMy servers were very attentive and friendly and I was well taken care of.
1;I don't know why this place has 4 stars. The beer and pretzels were delicious. The fish fry was over cooked and blah. My salad was wilted. It's easy to find good beer. I can live without the pretzels. I won't be back.
2;I can't believe it's taken me this long to review Moira. I was there on their opening night a few years ago and while we were all super excited for a more upscale Asian place (and the first sushi place in the downtown area, for that matter), the restaurant had a lot of kinks to work out with delivery of food (particularly getting sushi before hot items) and just service in general. However, we were all pretty happy with the food. While the sushi wasn't the freshest we've had in Arizona, the rolls were well executed and the hot food was enjoyable. We particularly liked the red miso soup with tofu.  \n\nFast forward a few years and Moira has definitely worked out the service kinks. In fact, when my husband and I were there last Saturday night, we had some of the best service we've had in a long time. Our server, Heather C, was really attentive, with prompt drink refills and quick delivery of everything we asked for. The order of the food was all perfect as well, with the items we requested all coming out in the right order. \n\nI still don't think Moira's food is the best around, and I definitely have to give nearby Sens first prize for hot Asian entrees downtown, but it's solid and goes up a notch during HH, when much of it is half priced. I also give the nod to Sens for cocktails, as theirs are sweet/exotic while still packing a punch. I can't say the same for Moira's, which are all sugary sweet. I'd go for wine or beer (or a mixed drink, which was generous for the price) instead.
3;Very clean and modern, safe area.  Pleasant front desk staff, called me after check-in to make sure all was ok.  Detached sitting area, fridge, spacious, big TV.\nNegatives:  Strange thermostat, hard to figure out, and the usual lame Arabica Hyatt in room coffee.\nNot on older car GPS software, as it is a newer hotel, so beware if you are driving and have an older car, can be tricky to get to unless you know where you are going.\nWhen I woke at 7AM on a Sunday it was very quiet and I was surprized at how peaceful it was, unlike weekend Embassy Suites, but then very shortly thereafter I heard kids running up and down the hall and mirthfully screaming in Spanish.  There was a congregation of seven people loudly chatting, also in Spanish,  in the hall who seemed to deliberately get even louder when I stuck my head out to see what the commotion was about.  I suppose I cannot blame the hotel for the rudeness of its family-oriented clientele, however, as this is a universal problem in cheaper hotels with large rooms and extra sleeping areas.  Perhaps a check-in written discrete request to guests asking them to respect quiet hours would be in order? ( I know, wishful thinking).
1;This restaurant has been one of my favorites for several years. But the last two visits have been disappointing. My favorite meal is the House Salad with Salmon. The Salmon is always cooked perfectly. Moist, not over or underdone. But the salad has gotten below what is advertised. The lettuce is not a mixed green mix, it is just large, old romaine lettuce, in big unappetizing chunks. \n\nOn my last visit, there were no tomatoes or cranberries in the salad . A HUGE disappointment!! as this was one of the really special parts of this salad.\n\nI really hate to watch a restaurant compromise quality, especially when they have already increased the price ( although not a lot).  Sadly, Boneheads is no longer at the top of my list.
2;"Legendary Pittsburgh restaurant/nightspot, past its prime.  Interior was last updated during the era of Drakkar Noir and mousse, is now threadbare and chintzy, in a style that a few years from now will be considered edgy, cool and retro.  Restaurant itself is located in the upper lobby of a glass and steel building housing Mellon Bank and the local offices of Jones Day; would've been a hot prom date destination for a rich kid in a John Hughes movie. Service is inattentive and lackadaisical. I ordered a glass of wine that was tantalizingly described as 'unknown' on the menu. Wine by the glass is frequently a burn, since you never know how long ago the bottle was opened, but at a place which boasts of its carefully curated wine list, it's an enticing dare. Unfortunately, it turned out to be limp and shy, something which my waiter should've warned me off of. Plate came out hot, meaning my order had been sitting around as forgotten as my meal is now.  A chicken something, nothing memorable.\n\nIt's too bad, because this place obviously has an interesting past and still has genuine character, and the staff all seem to have been around a while.  It seems like a place you could warm to (and vice versa) if you lived in town and were a regular, and if you're just visiting it's definitely worth a look if you're into local history, or a serious cosplaying late 80s fetishist. But if you're not any of those things, you'll probably be happier eating elsewhere."
3;Just like any other In-N-Out you have been too... However, one thing that impressed me about this place was the fact that despite the number of people that come here, they are very efficient and get the food out in a very timely manner. Other places have trouble doing that when they have only a few customers. Maybe In-N-Out in Nevada is better than Cali?
0;This place is a joke. Maybe I am missing something, but any remnant of Rat Pack or previous organized Las Vegas business elements (wink, wink, nod, nod) is not evident. Maybe stains they left behind. Seriously. Have you seen this place? The diner stinks like old grease and dirty dish rag. The fireside lounge, well, let's just say, I threw all my clothes in the wash that I was wearing when I sat on those sofas. It does not evoke any coolness of the rough and tumble Vegas that some want to believe. It's more of a slimy, seedy underbelly. I need to go take another shower.
4;Awesome food and great service. Thanks Rob and Stefano.
0;I reserved full-size SUV from dollar, and I thought I were the luckiest person since they said that they will give me a free upgrade. When I was wondering how a full-size SUV is upgraded, the staff just give me a compact-size Chevy SUV with a few of dents. The car is abused so very hard to drive. The steer wheel just is unpredictable. I double checked with them, and they insist that trash is what I ordered. Not returning the money due to providing lower class car, no apology in any way.   \n  This company is totally a shame. I have never been deceived like this. Keep away from Dollar because you actually pay more than the cost of renting from other companies.
1;I had very high expectations for Frijoles, and I think with a few changes they could turn things around.\n\nThe positives first.\nVery clean and well decorated\nTacos had a layer of cheese that was a nice idea and tasted delicious\nGreat Guacamole\nGood salsa\nFor some reason the fountain coke was really good\nVery friendly staff\n\nDown sides\nHard to figure out how to order, looks like a Chipolte when you walk in but you order at the opposite side where the register is.\nNo pictures to see what the food will look like.\nSneeze guard at head level makes it hard to communicate to staff.  (health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.)\nVery loud in dining room\nChips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way.\nExpensive for the portion size.\nCarne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time?\nOver all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!
3;the chicken fingers swept me away! i never went to wingstop cuz i hate chicken wings, but when forced to go with an associate, I had to admit after eating those fingers, I shall return to try all flavors (except the hot ones).
2;Realizing I wrote a review for Magic Wok under Teriyaki Kitchen, I wanted to say a few quick words about this place before my accidental review is read by too many people.\n\nThis is an old-school place. The food is pretty good, the prices decent, and it is close by. It is the sort of place that I can see using for carry-out from time to time. Service was decent, and it is a clean place, though nothing fancy.\n\nI had Sukiyaki, and it was okay. My wife, however, had the katsu chicken and it was really great. I plan to go back and try some of their other dishes and update the review as quickly as possible.
4;This was our first time renting from Sixt and it was great!  We made our reservation with Sixt because they had the best price for a minivan during spring training. We waited in line less than 10 minutes and the customer service representative was friendly, courteous, and efficient, and there was no pressure to upgrade or take extras that we didn't need, including additional insurance.  Once downstairs, another friendly Sixt employee showed us to our car, which was a clean, new minivan. All in all, a great experience renting from Sixt--we'll definitely use them again.
2;Lately i have been feeling homesick for asian food and been hitting up places that i haven't been to in awhile.  Recently re-visited Thai Pan for a quick lunch and quickly ordered without spending too much time perusing the menu.  It looked more diverse than I remembered including some Vietnamese additions.  I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.  A quick summary for my latest visit:\n\nPros:\n- convenient order-at-the counter setup\n- self-serve drink station\n- brown and white rice mixture\n- friendly and gracious owners\n\nCons:\n- too much napa cabbage in comparison to green vegetables \n- wish the owner/chef would be back in the kitchen vs. managing\n- spice level on the weak side
2;I'm not a banh mi expert but I really enjoyed my roasted chicken sandwich and bubble tea. I think my tea cost more than my sandwich (cheap sandwich, not expensive tea). Good value for a quick and nutritious lunch. \n\nThe small seating area was clean but quite crowded. I think this will be a good spot to pick up a picnic on the way to the Jardin Botanique when the weather gets nicer.
1;I guess the nice thing to say would be that they had beer and I didn't get food poisoning?\n\nThe staff pretty much could care less if you're there or not - I don't think I've experienced a server that was that checked-out in a long time. My food was edible, but came on a plastic plate? For real?? Is there not a real kitchen back there? No dishwasher. Very ungreen. Much like the rest of Phoenix.\n\nIf I didn't have a meal voucher from United and had to pay for what I consumed this would be a one-star. I'd rather eat Wendy's.
2;Great selection, various luxury makeup brands, but the SERVICE could improve. Service is a hit or miss, they often look at you and depending on that try to approach you. Sorry, but ignoring a customer isn't they way to go!  You could always fake a hello, it doesn't hurt anyone!  :)   On the positive side, good point system and good samples.
0;I booked a nice weekend. So I thought. Worst hotel I have ever stayed at. First I waited over an hour to stand in line to check in. Only to find out I was early and they wanted to charge me 35 bucks. The clerk proceeded to tell me that if I didnt want to pay I could check my bags at the bell desk and wait in another line for 45 mins!!! I then decided to order a cocktail from the hotel. I then brought the cocktail to the pool and was not allowed in the pool area with a drink I purchased from their own hotel!!! I was very unhappy that the pools were grouped by age!!! The pool was the main reason we booked here to find out my child that is 12 had to stay in the kid area with a baby slide! I got up the next morning to get coffee from the coffee shop inside the hotel and I have never been treated so rude and had to reapeat my order 3 times and it was still messed up and because they messed up my drink and forgot the Hazelnut they made me pay an additional 50 cents to add it which I had already paid . I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN! WORST VACATION EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
2;"I want to love this place. But, I just can't.  I felt like they were a mediocre burger place with a great beer list.\n\nWhen I walked in, I just stood there. As a first time patron, I had no idea that I was supposed to seat myself. There is no giving you an indication of this \""seat yourself\"" policy. I found a table, but it had no menus. At first I did not find this strange until I realized that all of the other tables had menus. When you re set a table, ensuring it has menus is important. \n\nI ordered the bruschetta and pesto burger which was delicious!  However, the size?  5 oz. for $7.59 with no size. There was nothing about this burger that made up for the price. It was tasty but small. Sides are extra. The options are fresh cut fries, shoe string fries or sweet potato fries. After you add a side of fries to a burger, you are looking at a $10 meal. That is a little crazy for what you get.\n\nMy dinner companion ordered the mac and cheese with bacon burger. The components were delicious (of course I sneaked a bite), but the burger itself was not great as a whole. It was dry. Maybe a cheese sauce would have helped?  \n\nThe beer menu is HUGE. There are a ton of great brews to try but otherwise, this place is just ok."
4;"I have been a customer for 4 months. I shopped around and after lots of calls and conversations, hired Dori's.  Christian and Amber own the company and do all the work.  They saved me from a HUGE algae stain in a brand new 20,000 gallon in-ground pool! Stupidly I thought I could take care of it-NOT!!! They came and in two weeks got the problem solved! Saved my butt!  They are extremely knowledgable both about water chemistry and pump/filter systems. They can fix anything and solve any problem.  They are honest, and care about their work.  They are very nice and will respond immediately to any \""pool crisis\""!  All of this for the most reasonable price around. They come every week and my pool is beautiful! By the way, Christian is a former US Marine and has served in the Gulf War. He is an American Hero! Needless to say, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dori's Pool Service!."
0;This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. \n\nThe New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.\n\nThe dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this.
2;Surprisingly good! Was expecting the typical greasy breakfast platter but they have a variety of selection from healthy egg whites to thick rich gravy. We tried the bisquit w gravy which was pretty tasty. Bacon was ok... Nothing to rave about. Otherwise everything we ordered was good and at the right price. They even leave you a pitcher of water and coffee so you don't have to keep asking the waitress for refills. No wait for seating even on a Sunday for brunch.
4;Two awesome places in one!  Rockin' unique vintage on one side of the store and on the other a great salon!  Annie in the salon is a master in her craft.  I've followed her for years now and it's awesome that she was able to open such a visionary store.  Her services are top notch.  She specializes in color but is awesome at haircuts, blow-outs and even the updo for your big day! There are lots of interesting, and rare vintage pieces, not to mention the up and coming pieces from local artists that are showcased every month.  That alone is reason enough to stop in and see what's new (or old)!
3;"I have been going to All About You for a little over a year. Heather does my hair, and she does a fantastic job. I have zero complaints about the cut and color. She always does it just right!\nThis is a cute salon, which is in what I think was an old house at some point. There are a bunch of different (small) rooms, so you are never in a room with more than 1 or maybe 2 other people getting their hair done at a time. I find this very preferable over the regular salon line of 10 chairs. It's a much more private experience.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back; not at all snooty (like I've found some salons to be).  \nI know they have services other than hair (nails, massages), but I've never used those, so I can't comment.\nIf I had any complaints, it would be about 1) the parking; which sucks. They have a very small lot you can park in (if you're lucky - I've only gotten a space there early on a Saturday morning), but otherwise you are stuck with the street parking on Lombardy. And it is right across the street from Bad Daddy's (used to be Big Daddy's), so you are competing with those patrons, as well as people that live on that street, for parking. 2) the pricing; which seems a bit high to me ($160 for partial cut and color). Maybe my perspective is off, but that feels high to me. \nOverall, as far as hair care is concerned, I would give it 5 stars. I'm just giving it 4 because it breaks the (my) bank"
1;This is very simple, no back story needed...\n\nBar service- AWFUL.  My friends and I were treated so rudely by not 1 but 3 bartenders.    It was so bad, I wish they could get negative stars.\n\nFood- AMAZING.  The best pizza in Arizona.  \n\nTerrible service= terrible review.\n\nThe Gilbert location is 1,000 times better.
2;Parking lot is a bit small but your typical goodwill. I love going on Thursdays, $1 days! They pick a certain tag color and no matter what the item is (Besides food, new and seasonal) it is only a buck! Some items can be a bit over priced, but if you go on a sale day you can scoop up a great deal on a donated treasure =)
4;I don't usually write reviews on services but James @ Hondatronics really impressed me.  I was in town and had a window switch that failed on me with my window stuck open and the temperatures in the 30's with a 240 mile drive back to LA.  I called a few other shops and they didn't sound like they could help me, but I saw Hondatronics on my GPS.\n\nI tried to remedy my window some more by myself and I blew a couple more circuits which made it worse.  I went by Hondatronics at 4:00 pm, it was near dark and James came out with a flashlight.  He trouble shot the problem within minutes.  He fixed all my blown circuits and got my window to roll up.  I was able to drive home that night.
4;Great place to hang out with friends or family. The good is great, the atmosphere is relaxing. The best thing on the menu I think is their Tower Burger. I almost always get it. It literally is a tower! Their pizza is good too and is good even when it's not conventional pizza. \n\nTheir coffee bar is great too. They have some excellent brews too.\n\nI highly recommend L.M.!
1;I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short of expectations.  Yes, it has a rock-climbing wall, and everything else, but the ambiance lacked that soothing quality you need for relaxation and the massages are mediocre.  Either the Canyon Ranch experience has deteriorated over the past 25 years since the first resort was created, or the quality of the first one was never quite fully duplicated.
1;"I brought some out of town friends here. I had never been before and the atmosphere look fun so we tried it. The look is cool and they had comfortable chairs. The menu seemed over priced. I sprung the extra $2 for the Doritos mac and cheese. It was good but for the extra money a bigger portion was expected. I ordered the chili cheese burger. I was never asked how I wanted it cooked. It came out VERY over done. My friend ordered the veggie burger and got a portabella mushroom sandwich instead, We asked the waitress about it. She looked puzzled and said \""You don't like it?\"" she told her it was good but not what she ordered the waitress continued to say that she heard her order this. I couldn't believe it the waitress was arguing when it was clearly her mistake. I won't be back."
1;Traveling from PHX to Chicago Midway on 11/29/14 via Southwest and my 70 year old Aunt & Uncle's luggage was sent on an earlier flight. They arrived at PHX airport at 9:30am for their 1:00pm flight and their luggage went on the wrong flight (it went on the 11:30 flight). \nWhen it arrived at Chicago's Midway Airport we were told it would be  held for them at baggage claim 7 and would be secured and locked. Upon their arrival at midnight, it was NOT secured or locked up. WHY did go on the wrong flight? Why did Southwest overbook the flight causing 2 senior citizens to be bumped off their flight???? They arrived in Chicago 8-9 hours LATE!
3;"A friend of ours introduced us to Tin Tin last summer and we've been a few times (most recently yesterday). We were appropriately prepped about the long lines and have only been to Tin Tin on weekends for dinner right as it opens. And other than Rusan's I haven't been to any other buffets in Charlotte, so I don't have much to compare it to. \n\nThe selections are pretty standard Chinese buffet selections. Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright. \n\nThe service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me. \n\nI did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more \""fusiony\"" dishes. I did get to sample a little of that, and they did not disappoint. \n\nOverall we're pretty satisfied with Tin Tin. Again, we're not big on buffets in general, but when we're in the mood for crab legs and shrimp this is our place. And it's great because the standard buffet selections look pretty good too. Variety is good. I'd recommend it here."
2;Great Pedicure! First time trying this place out, getting out of work. Searched on yelp for a close by nail salon and found this. They don't talk at all. Especially my nail tech lady. Didn't even greet me, but I'm not a talker either. She gave me a relaxing massage on my feet, liked it. As soon as she finished polishing my nails she just walked away and didn't say a word. She was just not in the mood to talk to me I guess. Overall it's an alright place if you're near by and in need of a pedi after work like me. Probably won't visit this place again though.
1;I have read through many of the reviews here and they have confirmed my findings.  I  was staying at the Wynn with my girlfriend and we decided to give this place a shot.  Let me start by saying that if you come from a town that has real high end sushi places, you will find this place to be mediocre.  The environment is clean, nice and friendly.  The service was slow for us.  The food was OK, not great though. The quality of food did not justify the price.  We had 3 rolls, 1 soup and 1 salad, 1 beer and 1 cocktail and the bill was $110. I'm used to paying about half that for places just as nice in Los Angeles, or the same price for a much higher end sushi restaurant.   I know its in a casino resort, but I still expect a bit more.  I would have given it 3 stars but both my girlfriend and I got sick from the food.
3;This is a really nice new location that has one of the strangest entrances from the Belmont Abby side on the planet! Who doesn't like a little Indy Car race track curves and dips on the way to a hardware store?!? I guess they did this to find out who knows how to tie down their lumber before they get to a main road? Sheesh it's ridiculous, but if you're in your car it's pretty fun to zoom around.  \n\nAnyway back to the store... Tons of selection and the garden center in the spring is gorgeous. The staff answered all my questions and I was able to find what I needed. \n\nPlease people if you own a truck don't buy bag mulch or dirt!! Sure if you only need a bag then go ahead, but if you need a giant load there is a better option. Go to a local nursery or garden center and buy a scoop or two of it and they will load it in your truck!!! You'll save tons of cash by not buying it pre-packaged in beautiful marketing branded bags. Yes your truck will get a little dirty, but isn't that why you bought a truck!?!  I can't stand seeing guys loading 20 bags of mulch in a perfectly useful truck bed. Seriously for less than $20 a scoop you'll get way more mulch and actually look like a man!!
3;Great service and the waiter was always checking on us never had to look around for service. They use these new computers at your tables to order drinks, food, desserts etc. It was nice being able to press a button and have a drink refill within seconds. You can also pay your bill from the tablet at your table no need to wait for a check and them to return your slip and card to sign. Oh and they hooked it up on chips and salsa to go!!!
0;"Man, we were robbed. We ordered from this place last night and we were sooo stoked when they said they'd be here in under an hour, awwww yeah. Then we heard the price, kinda steep for 3 items but whatevs, delivery charges and what not.  If the food was decent it wouldve totally been worth it. So flash forward 45 mins (awwwyeah) the delivery driver shows up and its a little old lady, and its cold as fuck, hence my distaste for leaving the house.  I was expecting some strudy human being at this time of night, in this neighborhood, in this weather, its all cold and she has a cough. Omg. Who the fuck would send their mom out in this cold?! You monster! So naturally my dear sweet southern fiancee tips more than we were originally gonna, how could you not? He was held at gun point by his sense of morality (...and the fact that hes a huge mamas boy). So then we sit down to eat... I couldve forgiven the dry, almost cold fries, the super hard bread on the sub... sure the chicken fingers were alright.... but they gave us two fucking mozzarella sticks... two...of the worst prepared mozzarella sticks I have ever had the misfortune of clogging my arteries with. Like... 6zillion nasty deepfried mushrooms and zuccini...and 2...fucking...mozzarella sticks. Worst fucking \""sampler platter\"" ever. Yeah. \nTldr...\nPaid a lot of money, tipped even more. .. food was not good...then they squashed my soul. My fat girl soul. Just ripped away any hope I had left to participate in delicious activities... all hope was lost. The SS delicious late night delivery food sank to the bottom of the crappy food sea."
2;From out of town and needing food quickly, two tables with little plastic stools, a cooler full of drinks and a chipper lady taking orders at the counter, we were cautious but it turned out great.  Cucumber Salad spicy and fishy just like in thailand, pad thai/ fried rice and eggplant something all tasty and spiced to level three.  Portions huge, still warming it up for breakfast 3 days later. Steamed dumplings  delish, roti cannai appetiser more than a meal, not the best ever but good.  tons of food and drink for three peeps $48.00
4;One of the best healthy food store I go to. I live their deli sandwich there. Place is nice and neat.
4;"I called ahead of time before making an appointment to ask some health questions about blood work for our dog. The receptionist was extremely helpful and very sweet which instantly convinced me after calling a few vets that this was the one I wanted to take our dog too. It also worked out nicely being so close to our house. \nThe Doctor was also very helpful and understanding. We were sent by a dog trainer to get blood work due to our dogs \""aggression\"" and instead of the doctor just agreeing to do it to make money, she informed us the symptoms of each of the problems we wanted to check and said that our dog's aggression did not fall under any of the categories. She even had some recommendations for trainers and behaviorists that she has worked with herself with her own dogs. We were very grateful for her insight and her obvious love for dogs. The exam was reasonable too, under $50. We do not permanently live in Arizona but I am glad that we will have a place to go if need be in the future!"
4;"We had dinner there, the place is always packed. Once you eat there you will know why. The food was amazing. We ordered this \""The natural\"" drink, ohh the flavors I loved them. Then came the Mediterranean salad, very good, then the Kale something pizza, which was totally completely unique... We ordered cheese ravioli from the kids menu for my son. My son just loved it, i mean i know my son, he is so picky and fussy about his food and it was just 6 o clock and he ate his meal very nicely, that means it was sure was delicious.\n\nWe are vegans so great for us. The food was so healthy and fresh, we just loved it"
2;First time eating at an In & Out Burger.  I've heard people rave about them, and after trying them, don't really know why.  They have 3 things on their menu, burger, fries, drink.  I walked in, looked at the menu, and thought I must have missed something.  I was just there to grab a quick burger, so I placed my order, then waited over 10 minutes for it to be made.  The drive-thru line stretched throughout the parking lot, so they were busy, but it took longer than I was expecting (for what was really just a burger and fries).  It wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special either.  Really, the lack of menu options is what surprised me the most...
0;"was beyond disappointed. Friendly check in but the room was a small box of a room, the view was nonexistant, the shower had no water pressure, couldnt get decent reception much less my wifi on my cell, and to top it off when i asked for a receipt i was not given one. \""we dont offer a receipt if nothing has been billed\"" but yet charged me 50 as a resort deposit.  What resort??? All they have is a lonely starbucks and a lackluster pool. Id rather stay in the bates motel then stay here ever again!"
2;Came here on a Saturday night during Divers/Cit\u00e9 with a couple gay guy friends and had a fun time! $4 cover is really reasonable (definitely cheaper than anywhere in Toronto) and the place is massive, with so many rooms to explore. We started on the rooftop patio, which is THE place to be on a nice summer night. It was really crowded, but there were servers circulating so that you don't have to always go up to the bar. The servers were really slow though, but at least they were friendly! There is a hot tub and a small pool. \n\nAs for dancing, there are lots of choices from salsa/bachata on the ground floor to house and hip hop on the 2nd floor. Things pick up around 1am. The house room seemed to be the most popular, although I was not a fan on the DJ. He played each song for a really long time rather than mixing it up... The DJ in the hip hop room was much better. The crowd is predominantly gay but it's also a pretty hetero-friendly place too. The crowd was pretty mixed overall and it doesn't seem like anyone cares who you're with, what you're wearing, whether you're anglophone/francophone etc. as long as you're dancing and having a good time!
1;Ok...I was so excited to try this place, seeing that I'm a fan of Man v. Food...so when I went to Las Vegas for my brother's bachelor party, we had to stop in and give it a try.  \n\nSo...upon arriving, the host said it would take about 35 min...but it took over an hour for them to seat us, even after asking him 4 times what was taking so long.  Not good.\n\nFinally we got to our seats, and I already knew what to order, since I did some research before going.  I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict.  I think almost all of our group ordered it too.  The waiter even said that was his favorite thing, and that we all made a great choice.\n\nIt took a long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it looked amazing.  Almost like a piece of art.  We've all seen the pics.  The only problem is IT HAD NO FLAVOR!!!!!!  Everything tasted the same...the chicken tasted like the eggs, the biscuit tasted like the chipotle sauce...there was no flavor at all...I'm a big guy who loves his food, but I probably had 4 bites before I just gave up hoping that the next bite was going to make it all better...it just wasn't gonna happen.\n\nSo...maybe I was just overhyping it in my own mind...or it just really wasn't that good...or maybe I just went on a bad day...but it really wasn't good...I wouldn't waste my time if I were you...
0;Poor food and really bad service.  We will never go back.
2;"I have to admit that despite the fact I walk past this place on my way  to the Pleasance Gym on a regular basis, I only recently realised Coffee Corner existed. \""Why I just happen to be a Yelp Scout, let's give this place a try\"" I thought.\n\nI think the name Coffee Corner is slightly misleading. Its technically not right on the corner and whilst they do offer coffee, its emphasis is on selling cheap convenient food to take away. There are a couple of seats by the window but in all likelihood you'll be grabbing and going. The food on offer is of the fast food variety: pizza, burgers as well as wraps. I think the latter is the safer bet, the wraps seem to be fresher and better quality. The pizzas and like are not really my cup of tea, too greasy (it's a good thing the gym is near by, you'd probably need it afterwards). Overall the quality is better than most takeaways, but not as good as some of the sandwich and deli shops around nearby Nicholson St. It is cheaper however.\n\nIf you want to spend a long time sipping coffee and taking the atmosphere in, go elsewhere. If you want a quick bite to eat on your way elsewhere or some coffee to go, Coffee (just off the) Corner is adequate."
3;I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm going with 4 stars because *I* had a great time, even though some of my friends didn't have such a great experience.  Additionally, I visited Commonwealth on the night of First Friday, so I think things might be different at other times/days. \n\nTo the review! \nIf you're going to visit Commonwealth on a busy night (holiday weekend, First Friday, etc), get there early!! We arrived around 10p, and while there was a line to get in, it wasn't too long, maybe 5-10 minutes.  It was busy, but not overly crowded.  The space, as others have mentioned, is beautiful. Just a gorgeous bar.  We didn't get anything fancy as far as drinks go (sadly), but what we did get was fine. Slightly overpriced for downtown.  \n\nHeading upstairs- I thought this was just as cool. A rooftop lounge/bar/dance floor. I felt like I was in another city! There was table service, and they were letting people sit at the unsold areas until they were purchased.  The DJ was fantastic, people were dancing, and it was just lots of fun.  Unfortunately, as the night went on, things started to go downhill.  By 11, the line outside was getting crazy long, and we stupidly went downstairs. We had quite a long wait to get back upstairs because they were full to capacity, unless you had a wristband (?) or had a table. We luckily made it back up when a large party left, but some of our other friends weren't so lucky. Downstairs was pretty unbearable by midnight- I don't know how people ever got a drink because it was so crowded.  Even upstairs, it took forever.  \n\nI'll be back, but definitely would advise to make this an early stop on your Downtown adventures, or to go during the week (and not on First Friday!)
3;I have to write this review to counter all the bad reviews. Granted the service is NOT always the best. I think they have a very small staff which is kind of a catch 22. But their sizzling beef is incredible. It is about my most favorite dish in the whole Vegas valley. Great quality beef and so tasty. So if you are not in a hurry give them a try.
3;Movidos por un cierto contentismo provocado por unas cuantas copas de vino y un delicios\u00edsimo whisky, terminamos una de nuestras m\u00faltiples cenas en este pub de Edimburgo. Un sitio bastante chulo, y donde los booths (los sillones con mesa en medio) son tan privados como que tienen una puerta.\n\nEs pay as you go (es decir, hay que levantarse, pedir en la barra y pagar) pero est\u00e1n especializados en whisky y merece la pena pasarse a catar un poquillo. Yo ya no pod\u00eda m\u00e1s con el whisky, as\u00ed que ped\u00ed un c\u00f3ctel, que obviamente no es su especialidad, aunque tampoco estaba malo del todo.\n\nEn serio: c\u00e9ntrate en el whisky, te ir\u00e1s a casa m\u00e1s contento.
0;I recently had an alignment done on my car at this location (rainbow and 215) and when I got my car back it was in the same if not worst condition   than when I left it. I was informed that one of the nuts for a tie rod was ceased, I didn't have time at the moment to ask for a refund or redo the alignment, so I took it to another Firestone and they had no problems in performing the procedure correctly. I have read some of the reviews for this store and dismissed them, I made a mistake. I would suggest that you do your research when going to places like these, but you can always use my experience, for example, and learn from it. Although the problem was solved, I would recommend that you avoid Firestone altogether, the only honest place in Vegas that I have found is called Allied automotive located on desert inn just west of valley view. Hope this helps.
0;I had the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED. DONT EVER STAY HERE, THIS PLACE DOESN'T DESERVE ANY BUSINESS. about a month ago my friends band was headlining a show there, we packed the place, spent all our money having a great time, we all stayed there too. About 8 rooms we had all together. In the morning I stummbled out of my room to ask the front desk for MATCHES so I could have a cigarette outside. Next thing I know the security man grabs me starts to man handle me and pushes me outside. Says I'm kicked out and that he's calling the police...BECAUSE I LEFT MY ROOM? I'm five foot one and petite, wearing jeans and a tshirt, IN NO WAY WAS I THREATNING LOOKING OR LOOKED LIKE A PROSTITUE. so at this point I'm getting scared, call my son at home and tell him to call 911 because I'm being harassed and pushed around by the security for no reason. I have never been treated like that in my life. Finally my son gets ahold of my friends who are upstairs sleeping, and they come down and save me, we leave. I call the corporate office, who then gives me the name of the manager. I call him and explain what happened, he tells me it's my fault because I admitted to being intoxicated from the night before. REALLY, REALLLLLY, SO APPRENTLY IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ADULTS TO CHOOSE A LOCATION FOR A PARTY DRINK GET DRUNK STAY THERE, AND NEED MATCHES IN THE MORNING. I WAS BESIDE MYSELF WHEN THAT'S WHAT THE MANAGER SAID. THEY ARE THE WORST, WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS FLAT OUT WRONG, AND I SHOULD HAVE PRESSED CHARGES, INSTEAD PLEASE READ THIS AND SERIOUSLY CONSIDER GIVING THIS ESTSBLISHMENT ANY BUSINESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AND I CAN ELABORATE. jaynafay@gmail.com
1;"I wanted to do some price comparison to see if this place could be a savings over my vision insurance options. I have several pairs of glasses that based on my previous insurance are loaded up with all the niceties that Pearl Vision has to offer. I no longer work for the company that gave that type of vision coverage.  I have visited this location twice in the last six months and the experience both times has been poor. The first time there were already customers looking at glasses when I walked in so no one greeted me. I looked around and left and don't think anyone noticed. \nThat can be great if you don't want to be bothered however if you have questions or are a social person that type of treatment can be offsetting. \n\nThis next time I was greeting right when I walked in and told if I had questions to ask. Nice. I looked around and when I found my frames went to the counter. The sales woman was snarky and I don't even think that she was aware of it. She could not answer my questions without basing them on the current type of glasses I was wearing. I have several pairs of glasses that based on my previous insurance are loaded up with all the niceties that Pearl Vision has to offer Helpful in overwhelming me but not so much in just answering my basic question; being with the promo offered what do you really get.."
0;"My gosh, I understand people come here with kids for the atmosphere but can they at least try to make the food taste ok!!!!!\nCame here 7/14/12 to celebrate my kid's bday. This would be our second time here and I was thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch. Anyway, I ordered the sampler: Egg rolls--tasted like dishwashing liquid, mozzarella sticks--bad breading, chicken strips--tasted like kid cuisine nuggets, soggy, horrible breading, no taste, spinich dip--holy crap it was bad. lumps of unmelted cheese, tasted like paste. The only things I enjoyed were the tortilla chips that they probably got out of a bag. My son then received the bday volcano brownie; we only at the ice cream. Duncan hines box mix was better than this crap. Sorry for being so candid but this is ridiculous. The food is HORRID IMO...on top of that we had a less than enthusiastic server. I will never go back to this place!!!\nNo more sparklers on deserts either & all of the animals do not move..."
1;Bland food. Got the #7 platter which is a fish taco and a mini burrito. The fish taco had no flavor and the mini burrito was sub par. The iced tea is from a machine and tasted awful! I poured it out and got the instant lemonade instead.
3;I'm in love with Panini... wish we had one in LA. The food is AMAZING.  Our server was really nice too.  The menu is enormous, but every time I've gone I have loved my dish.  The only negative... theyre closed on saturday nights... Come on Vegas... you really need to work on having something kosher open on a saturday night!!!!!!!!!!!!
4;"Oh Grimaldi's you never disappoint do you.  \n\nThis was my first visit to the Grimaldi's located in DC Ranch.  I didn't expect anything different from this location.  The pizza was superb and the service was great.  Our waiter was almost too attentive to our needs at times, but I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.  The pizza came out very quickly within 10 minutes of placing the order.\n\nPepperoni and Jalapeno all the way all day everyday!\n\nThe location was a bit of a ghost town though.  There were a lot of \""available for lease\"" buildings all over the place.  I'm not sure what happened, but it's a shame, because the location is great and has the potential."
0;Save yourself and try somewhere else. The taco and relleno plate was just horrible. A mush of egg and bad cheese. Taco was dripping oil.  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better.  Bland tomato sauce.  There is better food out there.
0;I have visited hazelwoods over ten times. I like the food and the set up of the bar in general. I want to like this bar and have given it a fair chance. Despite this I will not be returning. The day time wait staff has been unfriendly and has not made any attempt to engage me as a customer. With direct competition across the street I expected more of an effort to keep potential repeat business. I have repeatedly not been greeted in a friendly manner, been engaged as a customer, or thanked for my business in any way. I work in the service industry and understand and value of taking care of your regulars. I will not be returning to this restaurant with other options in the immediate vicinity.
0;This is update to review submitted in 2011.  Unfortunately apartment management and maintenance have deteriorated with changes to onsite staff.  Pool area is never cleaned, dumpsters have trash everywhere and are disgusting, all plants are dying because they're never watered, and most distressing, downstairs neighbor keeps two pit bull dogs on patio 24 hours a day and they poop and piss on concrete which draws flies and smells horrible.  Attempts to resolve this last issue were unsuccessful.  Probably will be moving out soon.  Very disappointing.
1;Let me say this. This venue is not a music venue. This is a ballroom. One you would use for wedding. I loved Adele but hated this venue. It was hour, crowded. It took 30 minutes to get in and after going to the other side learned there was only 1 bathroom on the other side. Book and stage and the pool are so much better venues at Cosmo
0;"On August 30, 2013, I was staying at the LVH right around the corner from this store. Due to the heat, my battery in the truck died, but I was able to get it jumped. The Bellman at the hotel recommended going to this Pep Boys. I drove there and parked in the \""drive-up\"" service area, yet after 15 minutes, no one came to help. So I walked inside and went to the service area. There was a young blond girl and a young man there. Neither of them even bothered to look up and greet me, or even ask what they could do for me. Instead, they kept their faces at their computers and probably hoped I would go away. After another 15 minutes of standing there, some other guy told me I was in the wrong place and sent me to another counter. After another 15 minutes, and still no one helped me, I got frustrated and left. I drove Autozone across the street and got all kinds of help. Got the new battery, they loaned me tools to get it out, and refunded me for my old battery. It just amazes me that a Pep Boys store so close to the casinos wouldn't be a little more helpful, and maybe friendly. Not even a \""Welcome\"", or \""hello\"" was given to me. I would have been happy with a \""We aint got time for you pal, so bug off.\"" Well, that is kind of what I got. They couldn't care a less that I left............ Its just sad because they could make so much money at that location with out of town folks. They really need to work on their customer service. Go somewhere else folks."
3;Good size store across from the Nike outlet on the corner.  Good selection of shoes for me and women.  Also sells clothes and accessories (hats, belts, backpacks, socks, etc.).   Nice large bench square for trying on shoes.  Pleasant and helpful staff.
0;Back here for SHOT show...show itself is awesome but convention center makes me feel so digressed. Location is okay, but design of floors, access is nightmare, food option is worst, who in the right mind wants to host events here?!
0;"So I have had it with the lousy software updates, with each new rendition of iOS, from 5 to 7, getting worse and worse, as well as introducing new bugs that are not resolved. \n\nIn total, I have replaced my iPhone 4 once, and my iPhone 4S TWICE, all within a year of purchase. Usually its some sort of battery charging issue, it goes like this, the phone gets REALLY HOT the day before the battery fails, and very soon after that, it no longer holds a charge. It may stay at one percent, maybe it drops from 100 down to 0 in two hours or less. All THREE of the 4-Series iPhones did this to me. And it usually happens right after a hotfix patch.\n\nIn particular, I have had a bad experience with THIS Apple Store. In my final iPhone 4S fiasco, I went back to the Apple Store to get it replaced because its still within the range of one year since purchase. Everything went smoothly, supposedly. \n\nThen on my way out with my refurbished replacement model, I was immediately stopped by two of the male Mac geniuses that sort of look alike (they refer each other as \""Clark Kents\"" as some sort of inside joke). They told me to follow them back to the Genius Bar, only for me to realize that apparently I am accused as a thief as they sternly questioned me about \""Where was the old iPhone?\"".  Only then, did the stocky blonde girl (the Concierge), managed to show them that she had it, AFTER I started YELLING at the staff that \""the blonde girl has it\"". She FUCKING LOST THE OLD IPHONE that I gave to her in exchange for the replacement! If I hadn't made the Geniuses drag her ass back out of the break room in the back, I probably would have been arrested for a false felony grand larceny charge. \n\nAnd then it got worse, on my embittered way out of the store, NEW replacement phone in hand, the Geniuses actually followed my ass out profusely saying fake apologies. \n\n\nI no longer am one of those Apple fans. There is no amount of empty \""Sorry's\"" and fake smiles that can draw me back. \n\n\nHere is another story, of a different Las Vegas Apple Store experience.\n\nMy MacBook Pro, which I bought 3 years ago, is in need of a battery replacement according to the diagnostic tools that its been warning me with. \n\nBut, given how I was treated at this store, and the Town Square Location (they aided a thief who stole this very MacBook in reformatting and deleting the Undercover Mac software before selling it to a pawn shop, and I had to call Metro's Property Crimes Division to use the personal information I acquired through screenshots by Undercover to get it back), I refuse to purchase or request services or support from any Apple Retailer. \n\nIn fact, I even wrote a negative Yelp review of the Town Square location upon discovery of my stolen MacBook (through Wifi-Router GPS screenshots) a few years ago. I was complimented by many other Yelpers for my \""slick detective work\"" before it was mysteriously deleted months later by Yelp. I included screenshots of a thin caucasian male Apple employee that was reformatting my formerly stolen Mac, this evidence was also taken by my Undercover Mac software. \n\nI am considerable getting some sort of Android device as replacement. I realized I should have snapped much earlier, but my older brother is some sort of die-hard Apple fan that really doesn't want to let Steve Job's dream go. \n\nI however, am very willing to burn bridges. Especially built by those who turn on not just me, but their crazed consumers. You can Google it, there was a lawyer who sued a Apple Store, search for \""Michael Deverett\"" from Toronto over a plethora of stolen Apple products. He won surprisingly. \n\n\n\nRight now, I am digging around my laptop to see if I can find those old screenshot photos I have that implicated the Town Square location. But instead of submitting THAT along with photos on Yelp, which would surely be deleted, I am going to put it up on Google Maps.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nFound some of the implicating evidence for the stolen laptop incident years ago at Town Square. However, I remembered that it wasn't all the screenshots. It may be in my external HDD back at home, i'll check again when I get back. \n\nNote: \n\nIf these reviews get deleted, I am merely going to repost backups onto Google Maps instead."
4;OMG!!! Worth the money if you know what to order.  Service was great.. They are known for are the fried clarmari and the banna cream pie.  I went back every day to Emeril's while in vegas just to eat the dessert!!!  I recommend the Salmon dish for dinner.  I forget the name but I have to say this was the best Salmon dish I have ever had!!
1;The food could have been served hotter, the gyro meat could have been moister and more flavorful, the staff could have been a lot more knowledgeable and friendly, and the soda machine could use more carbonation. Too many other Greek food options in town for me to ever consider returning.
1;"This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  The food was okay, but the service was TERRIBLE!  It took 35 minutes to have our order taken.  We sat virtually ignored except our glasses of water until the waitress finally came over to see if we wanted to order.  Once the order was put in, we waited an hour for food to show up.  We asked after we'd been sitting for over an hour and the waitress said she would find out. When she came back she said it would be soon.  We asked why it had taken so long, and she said, \""It's only been 45 minutes since I put it in.\"" We replied, \""But we've been waiting for almost 1.5 hours.\"" She repeated that the order hadn't been in that long instead of apologizing and explaining the hold up.  The table next to us was then served (after waiting for ages) and she said, \""They were here first...obviously.\"" and then walked off.  We hadn't even said a word about the other table when she made that rude comment.\n\nAt that point we went to the manager to complain.  He apologized and about 15 minutes later it was obvious our waitress had been spoken to. She said, \""I'm sorry for the wait and we'd like to offer free dessert. should I bring you a chocolate fondue?\""  We said no and we would like to figure out our own dessert. She made another rude comment at that point. Something like, \""you *don't* want the fondue.  Fine.\"" One person in our party couldn't partake because it had taken so long to get her one side order that she then had to leave to make another engagement.  \n\nIt also took another 15 minutes to get our check and we tried flagging down anyone.  They avoided making eye contact so they did not have to come over.  \n\nLike i said in the beginning, the food was pretty good but I've had lots of pretty good food without the 1) super long wait and 2) crazy rude waitress.  I have to imagine that working at the Sugar Factory on the Strip in Las Vegas is a pretty lucrative gig for a waiter.  If they treat other customers this way they won't make any money in tips and the restaurant will suffer.\n\nI would suggest going anywhere else but this place.  Serendipity gets great reviews and it is right across the street. Go there (or anywhere else) instead.  Save yourself the trip."
4;I'll make this brief, because one of the previous reviewers just wrote a very comprehensive review of this little gem of a restaurant! \n\nThe housemade tofu is a revelation! First try it with the special Hokkaido sea salt blend, and then with the shredded bonito and scallions and ginger, with a little bit of the homemade soy sauce drizzled on top. Wow!\n\nWe tried dishes from all across the menu, from the asparagus okaki (fried with a crispy panko? crust) to the delicious kobe skewers -- thank you previous reviewer, you were so right about that beef -- to the whole fish prepared two ways. We chose sea bream, a very small, delicately flavored fish. It came sashimi'd first, then the other half of the fish was grilled. Beyond delicious.\n\nMy kids are so jealous because Raku had grilled rice balls, a real country-style treat that we used to have all the time when they were children. Yum!\n\nThe service and atmosphere were wonderful. We sat in a kaiseiki room, which was an intimate dark wood booth. Clientele ranged from locals (we overheard the staff greeting a regular saying they were worried because he always came in at 9 PM and he was a few minutes late!) to a group of Japanese businessmen to a couple with a young baby. All were treated excellently and all seemed to really enjoy their experience at Raku. We will be back.\n\nNote: it is a small restaurant, with about a dozen tables, so be sure to call in advance for reservations. It is a short taxi ride from the Strip hotels, and the staff at the restaurant was more than happy to call a taxi for us at the end of our meal.
2;Nice selection of beer, but I've found the food to be hit or miss. I've had some good sandwiches here in the past, but the grilled chicken wrap I had a few days ago was subpar. Also not a fan of the way all the food seems to come with potato chips. Still, this is a decent place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a sandwich.
0;This place is a dump. The parking is atrocious and is the main reason why I will never attend a Cubs Spring Training game in Mesa. It took 45 minutes from Center Street and McKellips to park our car. As you are driving about 1 mile an hour or less for 45 minutes. The parking was next to a residential area that had a throng of people selling parking and two lines of cars slowly inching forward with no idea where the end was and no signage to give the paying fan a clue as to what was going on. \n\nI heard this banging on my car which I thought was some gang banger or some overzealous resident trying to sell parking. It turned out to be a parking attendant that had the balls to bang on my Mercedes. This is not a fawking rental car and do you think I was trying to get away without paying $5 bucks for parking? First of all get in the proper position where you can make eye contact with the driver and maybe you can jog and get the driver's attention before you go banging on someone's car. Remember, I am driving at less than one mile per hour.\n\nI think you get the point, I rather spend my money at a restaurant in Scottsdale or Phoenix instead of wasting any of my money at Hohokam Park.
0;50 dollars for a 3 pound poodle puppy cut, kinda excessive...
1;"Was it just me?  I tried two different beers here and they both were bitter.  The one that was supposed to taste like Blue Moon didn't.  \nThis place seems to have a few locations, so someone is drinking this beer; but, as a beer lover, it won't be me unless they prove to me that they have one beer that is not so bitter.  I'm not into the beer bite thang at all.\nYes, I realize some people just loooove their garlic fries, but, for me, the smell was so overwhelming it was making me sick..and they weren't even my fries but my friends.  I tried pushing them so far from my nose as possible...just sickening to me.  \nNow to the food:  I ordered the pork sliders as an appetizer.  The pork was ok but the buns were kinda hard like they had sat out for an hour with no cover.  Huh?  That never happens at a restaurant and my friend (another good cook) had the same.\nThe service was fine, the location is great, the waiters were friendly...but I just don't like their beer or food all that much.  \nUnfortunately, Gordon, I have to give you a \""meh\"" and 2 stars.  I do so much want to love you but sometimes it just doesn't happen....sigh.\nReminds me of different guys who looked great on paper but I just could...not...get...into........yeah, been there, done that."
0;Saturday hours 9am opening. Sat outside for 25minutes past 9am i was not alone there was about 10 other people. We all left because no body showed to open store! Second time I came to this location. First time had horrible customer service. Was yelled at for coming in the store a hour and half before closing. Will not recommend this place to anyone!  Ace hardware is the place i will be going until i find a better hardware location
1;So I'm throwing up an extra star because the place was inexpensive.  I mean, $21 for a sirloin steak?!  Count me in!\nUnfortunately my friends, count me back out.  I don't know what kind of meat they use, but this thing was tough and resembled rope.  Seriously, you're ESPN and you can't cook a good steak?  C'mon I know you're on the Strip, but you can't mail it in like this.  Service sucked as well.  I asked for A1, got a bottle with not much left (and trust me that steak needed it a lot!).  Steak was served but I had to ask for a fork to eat it.  The staff are second rate and are tired.  I guess if I couldn't get a job at one of the big money places in Vegas, I'd be a bit bitter as well.\nSave your money and go to prime rib buffet.
1;Was in Vegas for Bachelor party and we got quotes from various hook up's for a cabana here.\n\nWe got 5k for a cabana, and 10k minimum by the pool.\n\nThat includes food, drinks. . and your left testicle.
1;Had dinner at Margaritaville tonight before the hockey game despite my better judgement as I have been there several times before. Waited 30 minutes and did get a decent seat outside to watch the crowd. The waitress was pleasant but as usual the food was just not that good. I ordered a Cheeseburger that was just 'so so'. The bun was not toasted and the cheese had not melted. My son had the Coconut Shrimp. It was cold and just not that appetizing. I just think that from a well-known chain like this, the food should be better. Lots of other options at Westgate, plan to try something different next time.
0;Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money.
0;Just terrible, even for a 24 hour cafe.  \n\nI came here because, well, just LOOK at these other reviews.  This place looks great, right?  Fellow yelpers, how could you fail me so miserably?!\n\nI made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.\n\nThe eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.\n\nAnd the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.  \n\nAnd the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.  \n\nI kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.\n\nTop it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.  \n\nI rarely send back food and then not give them the opportunity to try again.  But this place was clearly beyond all redemption.
1;I'm surprised I don't have a review written for this place. I definitely remember walking in after getting a coupon handed to me while my fiance and I were right outside the theatre. Being the extremely hungry people that we are, we decided to give Axxio Pizza a shot. We had previously already been to Slices, and figured that Axxio probably wasn't going to be all that different. Actually, we were wrong. Not because either of them are better, but because Axxio was just as bad as slices despite having a lot of cool options.\n\nThe have really interesting topping combinations that result in a pizza that looks, sounds, and tastes really good on paper, but in reality the execution is poor. I would much rather prefer traveling to Venezia's to get pizza, or skipping the pizza altogether and getting Chipotle or Yum Yum's if I am at the movies. Sorry, but this slice isn't for me.
1;"Persian room is a great place with notable portions which equates to lunch the next day.\nHowever, if you get anything to go, the portions are severally reduced; with the exception of the rice. I would've taken back if I didn't live 20 min north .\nThe portion of Persian macaroni was laughable for the price, and the tour of Persia at almost $40 was borderline fraud.\nIf you want Persian, eat in house, not to go."
1;Pros:\n\nFood and presentation was great. I asked for spicy and it was just the right amount of spicy, nearing uncomfortable but still very comfortable.\n\nThe vibe in the restaurant was cool. It still felt like a Mom and pop, but not run down at all.\n\nCons:\n\n15% gratuity was added for a party of two, without forewarning. \n\nMiscommunication with the server led to purchasing $2 of rice after it was said to be included.
3;My husband and I joined here several months ago and I have to say we love it. The facility has everything and more one would want from a gym. I love that it is light and airy and is cleaner than other gyms I checked out when searching for a new fitness facility. Classes are good but we have not taken advantage of them all. I like the aqua fitness, especially during the spring and summer when they hold classes outside.
2;After a weekend of St. Patrick's Day fare - decided that we wanted to go to Garduno's for their brunch.  We get to the restaurant and it's a totally different name.  What is this?  Shrimps?  Fish?  :)  We walked in half expecting EVERYTHING to be different.  It wasn't.  Everything is the same.  The brunch is still offered.  The only thing that's changed is the name.  It's been at least two months according to the hostess.  The menu according to her has changed just a little bit.  Today's visit didn't allow for us to review what possibly could have changed.  We were there for brunch.  \n\nFor the most part service is still there.  I think wait staff tends to let us do our thing because it is brunch.  Never an empty water glass.  Refill on chips came right away.  Our waitress even offered to stay with an infant while the g-ma went up and got a plate.
4;Love it! Everytime I go in I want one of everything! Feathers and lace and satin everywhere! Definitely make sure to look everywhere or you may miss something!
4;My favorite thing here isn't even the Korean BBQ itself, but don't get me wrong the pork belly is my OTHER fave as far BBQ goes... They have this raw beef and inside they wrap it with a variety of different vegetables: MMMMMmMMMmmMM!!!!!! SO good! It is a MUST every time we go. They used to have it as one of the combo's but I'm not sure if they changed that, but either way, when we do all you can eat, we must order this on the side. NOMTASTIC. \nThey will typically cook the food for you at your table but once in awhile when we go we are on our own with that, but that's fine too. \nIf you are consuming AYCE, EVERYONE at the table must participate and will be charged. That kind of annoyed me since my daughter was with us when we were stuffing our faces and didn't eat ANY meat or anything except some of her rice, yet she was still charged the full price. They could change that up or at least have a kid price since they typically don't eat as much as adults do.
2;"**1st stop of the Nite Tours event, so front of the line entry and no cover.\n\nThe Bank really does exist in Vegas?  Here I was, thinking it was just the name of Al Pacino's hotel in Ocean's Thirteen.  The real question is - where is the room inside The Bank with all of those Five Diamond awards?  ;)\n\nCompared to the handful of clubs I've been to in Vegas, The Bank ranks as one of the smaller ones.  After you make your way upstairs, they have a walkway that rings the outside of the club with two bars on opposing walls.  A tier below, there's a cordoned off section of tables, with another section right below that which circles their small-ish dance floor.  While it was cramped being out there dancing, at least there were brief moments where you had a bit of space.  However, it didn't help whenever the workers for the table service would plow their way through.\n\nAs for the rest of our experience, it was mixed.  The crowd was fairly mixed, but definitely a little older than places like XS, Tao, and Marquee and the DJ spinning was just okay.  I liked the lighting effects and how they had smoke jets and foam machines above the dance floor, but the dance floor itself is just so small.    \n\nWhile The Bank didn't necessarily have any fatal flaws, it didn't offer much that stood out either.  At least we walked away with one highlight for the night - running into Coolio and taking some pictures with him.  Too bad his celebrity status peaked over a decade ago though..."
3;I rode the light rail with a friend and met another friend at the Arizona Science Center for a meetin.org event. We had Groupons for the planetarium and exhibits. We watched the planetarium show on planets first. I was a little disappointed in the planetarium show because the narrator (who was VERY good with the kids!) went into detail about the planets. I had hoped to learn about constellations, so obviously I had chosen the wrong show. My bad. I liked how interactive  the show was, allowing us to push buttons to vote.\n\nI enjoyed the exhibits, especially the four seasons. That was cool having the wind blow in our faces one second, and standing there getting sprinkled in the rain during the storm the next second.\n\nMy friends went through the exhibits much faster than I would have liked, so I will be back a second and possibly third time. I'm waiting for the next Groupon before I buy my ticket.
1;Went here yesterday for lunch while my car was at MINI being serviced. The place for starters has no feeling of arrival. There is just a door on the side of a building with no awning, patio, etc. There was no one there to greet me when I came in so I made my way over to the bar. There were a couple of middle aged women running the bar and doing a mediocre job of it at best. I ordered the chimichilada, MAN, you gotta REALLY like mushrooms to eat that thing. The chimi part of it was ok, but nothing really to write home about. This place has been dubbed a direct competitor to Richardson's? get real. The chips were the only good part of my meal. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal, it was just not a good dish. Besides the food, the restaurant was just really akward in layout. The bar top seemed as if it were a removable piece of furniture from Ikea... not cool. One of the waitresses even had her two kids hanging out in the restaurant running back into the kitchen, eating, etc. Pretty sure that would violate some sort of health code. I'll stick to Richardson's thank you.\n\nUPDATE 6/26/08:\n\nWent here to please my co-workers... they all wanted to go after taliesin west tour so I figured I would give it another shot. Worse than the first time... the service was worse, the chips and salsa was worse, and the food was even more bland. Not as many mushrooms though. I'm gonna keep it at 2 stars though, because I hate to give out onesies.
1;Roller coaster is the only real reason to come here.  Other rides are just ok, and the miniature golf is actually decent as well.  Arcade has a lot to choose from as well.\n\nProblem is that this place is unsafe.  There's gang-types all around you, including the parking lot.  Will I get shot?  Does he have a gun?  And to top it off, you're looking at $20+ to have a good time here, and they sandwich you between the option of getting the all you can ride option, or pay per ride (both seem like too much $ for what you get).
4;The salad bar here is by far my favorite in town, fresh and various, big portion and reasonable price. The pizza is good. The Asian noodles section is actually the previous Ming's Table team, authentic HK food, the XO seafood undon is awesome and beef noodles with tender is pretty popular, too. The sandwich bar has the very cool Caprese sandwich! And last but not the least, must try the cold caramel macchiato here, way better Starbucks.
0;No play area? Bad idea when chik fil a is right down the street. The food... Its mcdonalds\n\nmonths later...\nI now officially hate this location.  My 5 year old had the day off from school and I had the day off from work.  I needed my tires rotated (see my Discount Tire comments) and it was lunch time.  My son was excited to go to McDonalds, so we dropped my car off at Discount Tire and walked to McDonalds- it was very windy and he was a little annoyed.  We got to McDonalds and their debit functionality was offline.  So I had no cash on me and I had to explain to my 5 year old that we couldn't eat there.  We had to walk back to Discount Tire and cancel our rotation.  I then called another Discount Tire with food within walking distance and they were not busy- so we went there and between the call and our arrival they got slammed.  So rather than get my tires rotated there and go to Chik-Fil-A, we drove back to our local Chik-Fil-A for a wonderful lunch.  I blame McDonalds for a horrible day.
4;Delicious cappuccinos (try the mocha, yum) in a nice little quiet atmospheric shop and wonderful friendly service. Definitely a nice place to sit and sip and read the paper or people watch out the window. Just a bit hidden but definitely worth finding. Had a tasty fresh chocolate croissant as well, be sure to check out the array of muffins!
0;"Meh...Blah...Robin, don't ever take me to the bat cave again!\n\nThis was the worst New Mexican food and margaritas we ever had! I never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it, but their house margarita just didn't taste right. We got chips and salsa, which you have to pay for, and was told which salsa was mild and which was hot. They must have forgotten the chiles as neither was hot. \n\nWe then asked our waiter about some items on the menu and his response was \""it's popular\"". We then asked what he would recommend and he said \""anything with sauce and cheese on it to cover it up\"". Wow...we looked at each other thinking \""is the food so nasty that we need cheese and sauce to get through it?\"" We decided to split the Blue Corn Enchiladas and the 1/2 Rotisserie Spicy Citrus Chicken. I don't know how to explain it but the enchiladas were tough and the green chile was tasteless. The chicken sounded like it should be spicy with habanero and guajillo chiles. It tasted more like it was smothered in BBQ sauce. It came with green chile mac n' cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw, well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all. \n\nThe only reason I gave it 1 star is for the cool atmosphere! Inside it's like a bat cave and the outside patio in nice weather looks relaxing. \n\nUnless we hear some significant changes to the food and drink, I think we'll have to hang out with Superman instead!"
2;Coming from San Diego, I am very familiar with Rubio's.  Consistent quality and the best fish tacos from a chain.\n\nThey now have mango quacomole which is essentially regular guacomole with a topping of mango salsa.  The salsa is very good and they will give you some on the side without the guac if you ask (for a small fee of course).\n\nI love the fish tacos and the carne asada burrito.  \n\nBecause it is a chain, you don't have the diverse menu choices the more authentic mexican restaurants do but you get good quality.\n\nI am only disappointed with their specials like lobster burrito that come and go.  They lack the proper flavors and when you like something, it disappears for a long time.\n\nStill, for consistent quality and flavor, Rubio's delivers.
4;I have been going here for the past 3 years. I love Dr. Ito and his staff! Everyone is so friendly and Dr. Ito is hilarious!! I never feel like they do work on my teeth if it is not necessary. Michelle the receptionist is the nicest person ever and will always walk through the steps with me of the payments or work that I need to get done. She is always so patient and accommodating! I would recommend anyone to go see Dr. Ito!
2;I always get the yellow curry at a Thai restaurant. This was no exception. Look, I like fast/cheap food as much as the next guy, but I like more depth of flavor in what I eat. The veggies don't really contribute anything to the dish. They just seem to be a space/stomach-filler. They needed to be steamed longer. Potatoes were still hard and starchy.\n\nCheck out Wild Thaiger. A little more expensive but definitely worth it.
3;This is a great little Italian restaurant the serves fresh creative foods. It has a reasonably priced wine list that features some great tastes. I have been there a number of times for both lunch and dinner. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the silverware. They use that flat tinny stuff with sharp edges. It is a pet peeve for me. All the chef's hard work to provide a great food experience is diminished when the sharp edge of the fork scrapes across your lips.
3;Never tried Kombucha before....this is the perfect place for you.  The owners open the tap room every Sunday from 2-8 to the public.  When I say tap room I mean a small room with a table a few chairs, a couch and a tv where they keep 3 different flavors of Kombucha on tap.  If it is your first time trying or you are a seasoned vet who home brews there own it is a great place to learn about kombucha and the way lenny boy brews theirs.   The owners are super friendly and certainly love sharing about the product that they pour.  You are welcome to sample all of the flavors on tab or just get a glass of one or even buy a growler to take some home (I now have 2 of my own cause I have become Kombuchalioc) all for reasonable prices.  They are now certified organic and use all north carolina ingrediants (unless unavailable in our great state).  This is also a great product for anyone doing a raw diet as they cold brew their tea.  I have only been here during the winter but there have been talks that as the weather begins to warm up they will be having live music and more outside in their parking lot which will make for a great relaxing afternoon.  Come check it out!!
0;The merchandise in this store is usually similar or  the same as Ross, TJ Maxx or Marshalls but it's 20%  more! The customer service is non existent.  I feel lucky if I can get a store employee to say hello. I just came from the store. Woman at the counter didn't say anything when I walked in, Asian guy also working, he walked by me probably 5 times and never said a word.  I was going to buy a wool wrap but when he took the sensor off it he pulled the fabric and made a big hole, he wasn't even going to say anything he just folded it over good thing I saw it! He finished ringing me up and asked me if I wanted a bag for my purchase? Really?f What a novel concept?  Didn't say thank you, good bye just mumble and grunted a few unrecognizable words?  Next time going to drive the 4 miles to TJ Maxx when I'm in the mood to spend money on something I don't need$$$$$$$$$
0;"Filth. If you like this stuff, you have the palette of a pig and you should be fed in a trough.\n\nThe standards met here are so incredibly low, it literally qualifies as \""I'm so hungry I'll eat anything\"". And at Primantis, that's what you get -- a sandwich that tastes and feels like it was dipped in a toilet before you got it. Just the thought is sickening.\n\nI've had drunk food in State College, Philadelphia, parts of Jersey, parts of North Carolina, Atlanta and Orlando and I've never had worse than Primanti Bros. They do nothing right."
3;Another Korean joint, if you're into this type of scene.  The Duk Bok Gi is great here.  The Korean chicken wings aren't as much.  I do like the kimchi tofu though.  The atmosphere is dark as always.  Music playing.  It has a slick decor with music playing a bit loud in the background.  Drink prices are fair I guess.  Food's a bit more than other Korean places.  Karaoke rooms are nice.  There's one that I know of in Z2 and a few in Zizzy which are across from each other.
0;dont deliver then don't offer it ... thats all i have to say
3;I love staying at planet hollywood! The beautiful yet modern decor, the helpful staff, and the free bottle of alcohol also helped. Here are a few plus about the PH resort... \n\nRooms - Each room has a movie theme. We stayed in the Universal Solider room. My friends got to stay in the James Bond Room. Nice room with a big bathroom\n\nShopping- All my favorite stores... bebe, urban outfitters, H&M. \n\nRestaurants- Good solid  buffet in vegas. There is also Koi, Strip Steak, \nPH Cafe. There are also lots of choice in the mall\n\nPool - Private Pool for Hotel Guest only so its not too crowded. They also have beer pong tables.
2;The hotel is in a good location, and the public spaces are great - beautiful lobby and trendy rooftop bar. No complaints about check-in or out, but housekeeping staff was pushy. I had to repeatedly ask them to go away as I had decided to work from my room one morning, despite the do not disturb sign I'd hung. The rooms are very small and old. There's no bureau or any drawer space, the room and bathroom are cramped. Room seemed clean, although the bathroom was a little moldy. Plumbing is pretty weak and there was no tub, only a small shower.
4;Camp Bow Wow is amazing. Period. Their facility is huge and clean and their staff - their staff is AWESOME! They are attentive to the dogs, playing with them and taking good care of them. Each of the play area also has a camera you can pull up and watch your pup play - because let's face it even though you're on vacation you miss your furbabies. They offer half days and whole days, longer stays and training. You can bring your own food and they follow all your special instructions for your pets. You get a cute little report card at the end of your dog's visit there - complete with a picture! It is such a relief to know our dogs are cared for when we need to go out of town. I would highly recommend Camp Bow Wow to any dog lover.
1;"I have been coming here for years and was a little saddened when the previous owner sold up and moved on. However the place was spruced up and new deli items were offered a few years back. For one reason or another it was quite some time till I managed to get back. \n\nI have visited several times for coffees over the years and pop in ever few weeks/months for a pizza slice as this is the only place I can find that sells these inside out school pi\\zza slices (base/cheese/sauce). I gave up on the other deli offerings some time ago, due to various bad cheese experiences etc.\n\nEach time I have the same issue. The staff really don't seem to have a clue about the products they sell or how the work flow behind the counter needs to work. it took 20 minutes for the couple in front of me to be served and for me to pay for a pizza slice and a quiche. This also somehow tied up all 3 staff for each transaction...mmm. Every time I am in there seems to be new staff, previously it was the same staff for years and years. I think this may be where some of the problems lie. \n\nOkay for a coffee if you not in a rush, but many of the food items are expensive and seem a little past their best on occasion. Staff really don't seem to know about the products or the service they are delivering.  \n\nThe good points \n\n- Pizza slice\n- Potatoe Salad\n- Quiche / Spanish Tortilla\n- Sit outside over looking the meadows\n- The coffee\n- Nice clean, well laid out shop\n\nThe Bad Points\n\n- The service, it is slllloooowwww\n- The staff don't seem to understand what they are selling and how the till works.\n- My missus is veggie and ended up with a quiche Loraine rather than the tomato/pesto one on the signage. Veggies and bacon don't mix well. ;D"
0;Is there a negative number for review?\n\nHad a horrible experience in this bar/restaurant today.  I went in with my African American friend.  As we entered the bar, the waitress (Erica) and the bartender ignored us.  When my friend finally asked if we should seat ourselves, the bartender told us to seat ourselves.  We stood there for approximately 10 minutes filming the waitress as she turned her back and rolled her eyes.  Sure enough, the nasty girl - Erica, was our waitress.  She came to our table and rolled her eyes while askiing if we wanted something to drink.  When we asked why she turned her back and why she did not greet, she claimed that people (at 3:00 in the afternoon) come in and leave, so she did not need greet us.  When we asked for another waitress, she refused.  We ultimately decided to leave.  \n\nTHE ONLY THING I CAN SURMISE IS THAT ERICA AND THE BARTENDER ARE RACIST SINCE ALL OF THE EURO AMERICAN PATRONS WERE BEING TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.  IF YOU CARE ABOUT JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS DO NOT GO.  BOYCOTT THIS BAR. \n\nIt is a horrible place.
0;Cupcakes look so good but don't live up to taste test not at  $2.50 a pice.
4;I have checked out many places that say they have the best BBQ and have been disappointed.  But this place not only have great food, but great service.  The kitchen offers many options and the specials are always great (blue cheese burgers, bacon wrapped hot dogs-which are now on the menu!)  They  have a spicy bbq sauce that not many places offer or that really isn't as spicy as i would like.  The food is abundant for the price, sometimes I can't even finish the sandwich and one side.  The green chile mac and cheese is great to pair with any sandwich and you need to bbq it up or you may think the meat is a little dry, but it is not!  It is tender, juicy, and could be eaten alone, but the BBQ does the trick!
2;For me, the food is just ok.  This place has a beautiful wait staff and is fun to drink at with friends so that is what saves it.
4;Anyone can take a machine to a car, but Steve is  not just a guy with a buffer, he runs a complete operation.   Every car's needs are different.  Mine was an issue of some type of industrial over-spray.\n\nHis follow up was great, as was his concern for my complete satisfaction.  The best thing about Steve is that he's not done until you're happy with the results.  He truly stands behind his work.
3;I think you need to consider the target audience for the Palms in order to truly appreciate it.  To give you an idea, let me explain my view of the archetypal Vegas casinos:\n  =  Bellagio is catering to the 50+ crowd with the classic styling and the reserved elegance\n  =  Venetian is great for those in their 40s looking for a lot of variety, or those with families\n  =  Wynn is luxurious yet modern, perfect for those in their 30s\n  =  Palms is all marketing hype and youthful abandon, designed to appeal to those in their 20s (or those who think they are still in their 20s)\n\nIf you agree with the above, then you'll agree that the Palms does a great job of filling a very important role in the Vegas casino cornucopia.\n\nThere are bright colors and lots of action.  It's fairly small (the casino is tiny compared to the mega-resorts), but the new Fantasy Tower almost doubles capacity while adding a new level of excitement.\n\nThe rooms in the Fantasy Tower are all brand new, and they've been designed with the metro crowd in mind - very modern, lots of dark woods (think W Hotel or THEhotel).  But the real reason to consider the Palms are the new clubs - Moon and the Playboy Club.\n\nThe new Playboy Club is an attempt to take away from the prime targets of THEhotel and the Wynn - young (but not too young) professionals.  The table games in the Playboy Club start at $50 a hand, so you aren't going to get your typical frat boy or sorority sister spilling their Bud Light on you.  The dealers are even more attractive than their profiles on the website, and it's a very dark room, giving it a distinct feel from normal casinos.  There's a $20 cover ($40 on weekends), so it's fairly steep if you don't have a host.  But the Playboy Club is connected to Moon, so you really get 2 clubs for the price of 1.\n\nPROS:\n- Great rooms for the price (the Palms is usually cheaper than hotels on the Strip)\n- It's on Flamingo Rd, so it's off the Strip and has extremely easy freeway access (perfect for the LA crowd or people with rentals)\n- Table games generally have lower limits - it's not unusual to find $10 tables even on weekends\n\nCONS:\n- It's not walkable to any other resort, so you need a car or time to take cabs\n- Although there isn't a conference center in the hotel, the Palms is often sold out - big games, holidays, etc.\n\nBEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!\n- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons\n- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms\n- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian\n- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay\n- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay
2;"Normally when I go to a restaurant I'm not annoyed when I'm given a kids menu. It's kind of a compliment since I'm twenty-four and a little sensitive about my age due to having a younger boyfriend. \n\nHowever, when I came here with my family the other day the hostess placed a kids menu down for me and thus began the silliest most awkward situation ever. My usual response is to just push it aside where my little brother is seated. Well when I did this the hostess promptly put another one down for me. This was so silly to me and my mother that we both laughed (in a non-rude way) The hostess then looked at me as if I were a naughty child and said, \""OH WOULD YOU LIKE A GROWN UP MENU??\"" There wasn't even a hint of playfulness in her voice. She was serious.\n\nJust about everyone heard. Normally I'm a pretty polite customer but I just rolled my eyes and mumbled, \""Yes, I'm twenty-four.\""\n\nShe didn't apologize and actually never brought me my own menu. I had to share with my MOMMY!\n\nThat hilarious story aside, the food is pretty good and reasonably priced. Their margaritas are buy one get one during Happy Hour so after a few of those the age situation was easily forgotten. My entire family ordered steak and said it was Houstons grade steak at Applebees price. I ordered fish and it was pretty good. They didn't charge me when I asked for a vegetable skewer instead of fries even though the skewer is more expensive on the menu.\n\nOh and also, I can throw my peanut shells on the floor. I feel like fucking royalty. The end."
3;Delicious burgers that are full of flavor. We ordered the OMG & the Black & Blue burgers. We really liked the smoked bacon flavor. \n\nWe also got a basket of sweet potato fries. They are too thin to really taste the flavor & they don't hold their heat well. The regular fries were fine. The sauce bar was super fun to experiment with!!\n\nDesert was a chocolate peanut butter shake. It was divine!! Just the right texture and mix of flavor. Yum!!
4;One of the most fun relaxing places in town \nI love it here!\nGreat drinks and great food \nExcellent nachos !
3;I feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far.  Especially as it seems most of them went during the first 2 weeks the place was open (usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant).  Personally, with the limited selection of tap beers in the town, this place is a gift.  Tons of micro brews and local suds - some that I haven't even heard of.\n\nLike piano music playing classic hits was nice- not crazy loud.\n\nService was just fine - very friendly.  We ordered a salad with chicken (way too much stuff in the salad) and the fried mushrooms (surprisingly delicious).\n\nOverall, suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft/local brews on tap, this place doesn't disappoint.
0;The restaurant is under new ownership, and just reopened in the last couple weeks.  The previous owner carried the recipes over from the original owner, Myles.  They were excellent authentic Cornish Pasties.\n\nThis new owner must not have gotten the pasty recipes in the deal.  They currently only have a couple breakfast pasties and one lunch menu option, the ground beef pasty.  So I went withe the ground beef pasty.\n\nThis pasty was like eating an unseasoned dry hamburger wrapped in slightly overcooked pie crust.  There was no hint of potatoes, onions, or anything but ground beef inside it.  The portion size was about half the size of what the original pasties were.  This actually was fine since it took a full can of soda to make it through the size that it was because it was so dry.\n\nI will not eat there again.  I can't wait to see what will take its place next.  Too bad since Teddywedger's has been in that location for decades.
0;If I could rate this place any lower I would. The food is way over priced for the small portions of garbage they give you. The food is cold and tastes like it's been sitting out for days. When biting into a dumpling my bf realized there was an extremely long hair cooked into it when he called them they told him he was ungrateful. Poor customer service and terrible food. I have no idea how this place hasn't been shut down yet with the hair and metal being found in the food. I wouldn't even give a dog this muff food. I'm still hungry because I threw it away.
1;Owner/chef Joseph Keller is the co-founder with his brother Thomas of Napa Valley's Buchon. His brother also operates the highly acclaimed French Laundry, Buchon at the Venetian and Per Se. Based on this dining experience, Joseph apparently is the less talented of Mrs. Keller's sons. Our meal started off with a white bean, anchovy, garlic and EVO spread delivered to our table with hot rolls. My wife opted for the crispy skin salmon served with cippolini onions, Peruvian potatoes, kalamata and asparagus tips in a sundried tomatoes tapenade. I chose the roasted chicken over garlic spinach accompanied by Joseph's signature French fries. I believe Heidi, the Review Journal's restaurant reviewer, must have based her rating on these fries because we found both entrees to be unremarkable.
0;WORST CLUB EVER. I love electronic music and this venue has great DJ's but a horrible sound system. The system could not handle the low or high end that is required for electronic music. If you are not getting a table do not go here. I had  FOUR drinks spilled on me and my drink spilled twice. I paid $30 for my ticket and $50 for my husbands during the presale to see Tiesto on March 15, 2014. They over packed the club. If i called the fire marshal they would have shut the club down. If there was a fire everyone would have died. I did not even stay to see Tiesto due to the overcrowding and lack of view. The wait at the bar was not even worth it for a watered down drink....just to be spilled. \n\nI WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLUB TO ANYONE.
2;Went here with a large group. Service was very good. Food and drink was really good.
3;This is one of our favorite places to go as a family.  The food and atmosphere are great.
1;As the newest location, one is led to think that the nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere are up to par with their flagship restaurant located on I-17 and Cactus, however, after having experiencing one dine-in with my family, it quickly became apparent that the phony smiles were merely a rouse for an over compensating and all too eager to get you out of their restaurant staff.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down we felt rushed.  We had very little time to decide on drinks, never mind browsing the fairly large menu for what we all wanted to order. It was only after shooing away the waitress four times that we were able to reach a decision as to what we wanted to eat and placed our order.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity waiting for or order to be prepared, my now starving family was brought a single plate of egg rolls, later to be followed by another single plate of pot stickers. At this point we are beginning to see how we are to expect dinner - plate by plate rather than in one complete order. This went on through out the remainder of our dinner, to include the waitress forgetting an entire item we had ordered only to laugh it off and blame it on her ink pen. Yes. You read right. Her. Ink. Pen.\n\nThe food was no where near as good as it's predecessor on Cactus and I-17, and the wait staff left a great deal to be desired.\n\nA few bones found in the sweet and sour pork, dirty stem ware, my wife tripping over a hole in the floor near our table and we FINALLY receive the check and concluded we won't be revisiting that location any time soon.\n\nThe ONLY thing pleasing about this experience was the 15% coupon found on their website.
3;Pros: Email notifications to offer standby room upgrades. Corner suites are gorgeous. The bathrooms are absolutely wonderful. Heated toilet seats! Lights, tv, and curtains all controlled through your tv or remote. For being the baseline suite it was pretty nice. \n\nCons: The roughest towels i've ever used. My God, they were rough. It was like using corrugated cardboard. Shampoo and body wash were a total fail as well. I'd describe it as faux soap.
3;Went for the first time today for lunch. Had the enchilada and shredded beef taco. It was great! They accidentally brought a cheese enchilada instead of beef. The waiter caught this and brought out a beef one even though I said I was fine with the cheese. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back for dinner now.
1;I didn't try the food to rate that so this is based on the service.  Honestly, I'd rather give them one star but the second is for the fact that they actually gave us tea when we sat down.\n\nWalked in and it wasn't busy at all, there were waiters standing around, and none were attentive at all.  We sat there with the menu for what felt like quite a while, even when we tried to call someone over to take our order nobody came.  So being hungry and no longer patient to tolerate the lack of service, we walked out and went upstairs to eat instead.  \n\nI highly doubt I'll ever step into this restaurant again.  To those who do go, good luck!
0;This bar use to be Mulligan's and was a blast 7 days a week. After a name change, some renovations, and a hand full of owners and mangers. This place is complete crap. \nOn two occasions I've gone and waited for a server and either I had to ask the bartender or security to track a server down after 5-10min of waiting. On a busy night I would understand, however when my group in one if maybe 3 tables there's no excuse. \nFood is inconsistent, and disappointing compared to its competitors. And the fact that I've gotten sick from eating there twice is another reminder on why I refuse to return to this bar.
2;It seems like a frozen yogurt joint is on every block-- I have at least 5 within a 5 mile radius that seemed to replace all the passe trend  cupcake shops.\n\nYogels, however, is my household's go-to spot because of 2-for-1 coupon from their e-mail club.  Their yogurt flavors are pretty boring and unmemorable (but with a nice selection of toppings) but you seriously cannot beat paying $4.00 for yogurt for two people. The yogurt may be marginally better at Menchies or U-Swirl but, damn, $12.00 for two people? Um, no.  I'll take my Yogel's 2-for-1 and hope for improvements in the meantime.
1;The music is out of style! The view is really nice but its definitely not for a 21st bday!
3;First, I must say that I'm a Hot Topic fan, in general. This particular store is pretty small in comparison to most, but it still manages to pack enough awesomeness into its crevices to keep you coming back. And what you can't find in store, you can order online. \n\nIf you're a fangirl (like myself) or fanboy who likes to have thingamajigs from your choice fandom, you're likely to find it at HT. This store has a nice selection of HP (Harry Potter), Dr. Who, Supernatural, Disney, Marvel, etc., goodies, ranging from t-shirts, jackets, & belts, to wallets & backpacks. HUGE selection of band & pop culture t-shirts. Their clothes (especially the women's jeans) run small, so keep that in mind. When I was a size 2, I needed a 7 in their jeans. (They have a sister store, Torrid, which offers plus-sizes.) \n\nGoths will find no shortage of black everything. Cute punk outfits too. Fun socks, hats, & accessories. Head to the back of the store to search for clearance sale items. \n\nThis store is neat, and there are some really cool employees working here. \n\nSign up for their free HT+ membership/rewards program and get special discounts throughout the year, including a birthday discount.
4;We have dined at Buca before, but it had been a long time ago and boy did we forget how great the food is here! We started off with the di Beppo salad, so fresh and the Italian dressing was so flavorful.  We shared the supreme pizza and WOW, large topping, super fresh ingredients so full of flavor. For dinner we shared the carbonara. Our server Jake suggested saut\u00e9ed shrimp with the dish and it was just perfect. We finished the meal with the chocolate cake. The food was superb and the personal service from Jake just made the evening perfect. We can't wait to go back!! Thanks Buca!
2;Its a very nice big store and good prices but their outside security is not so good mostly at night . Be careful when alone ,its dark and no security around if something goes on out there no one will hear or see if late . Bad bad lighting needs more light
0;KOA should not sponsor this RV park, it is horrible. I can't believe it is a KOA! It is a PARKING LOT! sure its on the strip, but wow, when its 114 in the shade this is not where you want to be in your trailer. sizzle sizzle sizzle .....pass out.
3;You get what you pay for.  But here, its actually true.  Excellent value, they don't rip you off.  And, it has all of the standard gym equipment I expect in a gym.  It helps that they have a lot of locations.
0;Don't bother to go to this location. Their notary isn't on premise regularly and it'll be a waste of a trip.  Terrible service model.
0;I'm glad this particular Denny's is closed. I remember going there about a year ago with my folks for lunch. we'd just gotten out of church and decided to eat out instead of rushing home for lunch. \n\nThe waitress that took our orders made fun of my Pennsylvania accent . Then she went away for twenty minutes.  She finally came back with our coffee and water. She took our food orders rather arrogantly and disappeared again for almost an hour. \n\nOur food arrived and were appalled  at its quality. The cheese burger I ordered was dripping with grease and oil, the fries were crunchy rather than crispy, My mother's soup was cold and watered down. My father's sausage and biscuits w/ gravy were a lumpy blob of goo.\n\nThe manager offered to comp us another meal but his attitude about it was condescending and arrogant. I know it's been years since my folks and I have been to a Denny's but if this is how all of them treat customers and their orders, I will never go to another one. And I havent been to one since.
2;Papa Dells pizza pales in comparison to real deep dish pizza. The crust is very thick and not flavorful. The sausage and pepperoni toppings aren't anything special. I do enjoy the amount of cheese they put on their pizza. If you want the Chicago pizza experience don't waste your time here or money.
4;Today I had an appt for a general check up for my newly adopted pet. I've been petless for 8 years and was super happy to be able to find the vet who I used back then. I have to say. I've never had a better experience with a vet office. Everyone clearly loves animals and their jobs. I give them the highest recommendation.
2;Cheap? No. MASSIVE? Yes. Worth the moderately annoying line? For sure.\n\nBut stick to the dessert crepes. My 'savory' crepe was less than thrilling. That Napoleon (lemon custard, berries, cream) was outta this world. \n\nAlso, an iced coffee with Baileys is an EXCELLENT jumpstart to a day of gambling, in my professional opinion.
1;I don't have too much to say here, but I think the quality of the yogurt was a bit disappointing for me. Plus, the mixers and the yogurt stations were messy and didn't look very appetizing
1;"This place specializes in reheated pizza.\n\nThey have a sign now that says all pizza they serve has been made within the last two hours.  But, I ate their one evening, and sat there for 2 hours.  During that entire time, they only remade one of the 6 half-pizzas that were sitting out.\n\nIf you ask what is fresh, they always tell you that everything is fresh.  My next question is what do they have that doesn't need to be reheated in a microwave or toaster oven.  They usually suggest something, but then tell me that it needs another \""5 minutes\"" before it is ready.  \n\nThe place is a joke.  If you want real NY style pizza, you are in the wrong town.  I'm giving them a second star only because I know of no other NY style pizza places in town."
4;I rescued my ball of canine fluff (Harley) from the Humane Society two years ago. What I didn't know was that when I adopted him, they decided to neuter him before I took him home. When I went to pick him up Harley had a brand spanking new cone around his neck. So came the search for a veterinarian stat and I needed one who could be trusted to take top notch care of this mischievous dog. \n\nI learned quickly that a dog is expensive and especially with medical bills, shots, office visits...and that's just hitting on the basics. As I was visiting the Petsmart one day, I came across the Bandfield Pet Hospital conveniently located inside the store. I decided to begin chatting with them to see about pricing and they told me about their amazing deal. For between $25 and $35 a month, they offer a service where you get unlimited office visits, several shots, an annual dental cleaning and many more benefits for your animal. I cannot tell you how many times this service has come to the rescue for me. \n\nI absolutely love the Bandfield staff. Harley has spent his fair share of time in the doctor's office and every time he visits, the staff is extremely friendly and nice. They always get Harley in and out quickly. The vets know what they're doing and they take great care of the animals. After a visit, Harley always leaves happy and refreshed and normally with a clean bill of health. \n\nThe greatest part about Bandfield is that they are conscious of the economy and know they don't push unnecessary medications or products just to make money. They really do look out for the customer, both canine and human, so for that I am a forever fan of Bandfield! I think I can speak for Harley as well.
3;A club that doesn't charge and entry fee and does their own version of Jager Bombs (Opium Bombs) for just \u00a31.50.  Honestly, what more do you want?\n\nEdinburgh's club scene seems to be divided between meat markets and posing parlours and this is about the only other option!  \n\nAbsolutely no pretentiousness to the place at all which is the best thing about it.  You can be totally who you are and not have to worry.  \u00a31 beers will certainly help you to forget your troubles too.  \n\nThis place is really cool but be careful as it is easy to get lost and loose your friends in the maze of cubby holes and areas that they have.  Downstairs you can prop up the beautiful blue tiled bar or grab a booth and relax.  Upstairs is where it really kicks off on the dance floor to good rock tunes.  \n\nGood fun any night of the week.  Open until 3am, always a good shout.
0;"Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too. \n\nShort Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service. \n\nLong Review:\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it.\n1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.\n\n2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable.\n2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable. \n\n3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.)\n3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, \""Next time, don't take so long to take photos.\"" WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.\n\nThan came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served. \n \n4A) Roasted duck...Okay.\n4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. \n\nThe Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  \n\n5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course. \n\n6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware. \n6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?\n\nThan while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could. \n\nVerdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere."
0;Not good. Just not good. From service to food it leaves a lot to be desired.
3;Love this theater! Can't get more comfortable or convenient when it comes to pressing a button and food/drinks just magically appearing ... well not entirely magical as it does come at a price ... I think it is a bit too over priced but worth it for a treat now and again. The seats in both areas (full service and regular seats) are extremely comfortable and make it hard to imagine sitting in a regular theater again!
3;Delicious crepes, at least the vanilla bean custard and strawberry one! Busy place on Saturday morning so a long wait for our food but good. My husband and I each ordered the vanilla and strawberry crepe which was delicious but we were both still a little hungry afterward. Will order more next time! Great neighborhood vibe.
4;My first experience was a wonderful one.  Not a big fan of crawfish, but loved the shrimp soaked in hot n juicy sauce.  I can inhale a whole pound myself.  Mmmm... protein yay!!!!! Tasted my friend's super spicy crawfish, I swear my lips were comparable to Jay Z's.  Service was fast and friendly.  Except for the homeboy with the glue on black nails.  I hope he wasnt the one cooking up of crawfish.  God knows what is in those freakin press on.  YUCK.  Price is very very reasonable.  The pound of shrimp purchased was only $9.99.  No need for rice.  Must get cajun fries for $1, a dozen of sausage for $4, corn $.60 each, and potato $.60 each (potato is not that exciting, id rather get a corn).
4;absolutely wonderful --- it's huge -- there's all kinds of awesome foods for sampling and purchase... I left with about 10 lbs of various cheeses -- all the samples from all the vendors were awesome -- it wore me down walking the entire market...\n\nwill absolutely visit again
3;It's been awhile since I ate here. We stopped by on Sunday for lunch because I was craving breakfast food. I was expecting more expensive menu but was surprised to find a breakfast plate for $4.99. It was the SOS, the gravy on toasts caught my eyes. I live and die for sausage gravy and theirs was pretty good. They layered half a toast and half a sauage pattie and covered it with gravy with 2 eggs on the side. Lots of food for the price. The picky eater ordered wings, and the wings are of good size. Our lunch tab was less than $15 for 2 people, not bad not bad. The service was good as well, and it seems like they have a good crowd of regulars. I may just have to come here more often.
4;Yummy! Had the larger cheese burger and it was delish. Hot, juicy and fresh. Staff is passionate about their product and so friendly and happy. Ordering is super easy and we were served quickly. Cute patio area to enjoy a nice glass of vino. I am only able to eat grass fed beef and this is my new favorite spot. Will definitely be coming back. And....the frozen custard was fabulous!
0;This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....
1;"Not Impressed at ALL!!!  Had to wait nearly 45 minutes when we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  I really didnt enjoy standing in the middle of the parking lot waiting for my table!  When we were finally seated I felt right at home because our table was also in the parking lot! LOL!\nI planned on ordering the eggplant lasagna - until my friend pointed out it took 45 minutes to cook - no thanks.  I want outta here quick.  Instead I ordered the Lady is a Scampi - I will describe it as strange.  My friend ordered a pasta dish also and a side order of the Giant Meatball.  When the \""Giant Meatball\"" came out it wasnt giant it was all cut up in the sauce - aka meat sauce.  One good thing was the food came out quick so once we were finally seated we were outta there quick.  I wont be back."
0;"This place is to be completed avoided. I wish I can give it negative stars..  It went from bad to worse in a blink of an eye... The only thing that was utterly FANTASTIC was a clementine-champagne frozen drink (which shouldn't even be considered a drink but a sip). Besides that, everything was completely forgettable. Given the opportunity to go back knowing what I know, I wouldn't go back even if someone PAID me.\n\nThe \""order\"" of the night was an entree of foie gras, main plate of salmon and beef tartar and dessert. The entree and main dish took us over 2 and a half hours to receive. I wasn't aware that was a normal delay. \n\nLet me elaborate as to how the girls-date-night went out the window and we finally just walked out...\nReservations were at 8pm. Got there on time, seated instantly. Then waited for exactly one hour before our entree got to our table (to which another table came in, was seated and served 2 orders before we got our first). Our main meal came about 45 minutes after. At this point, we are contemplating leaving. I'm sorry but is it normal to get 2 plates in about 2 hours..?? \nOn top of the horribly slow service, one of the waitresses was having a GREAT time with her boyfriend (while she was on the job); sitting on his lap, giving him \""affection\"" and having drinks. Funny how she can have HER drinks but we can't get OUR food.\nAfter over 2.5 hours, we finally decided to leave. YOu know, for RAW food, it seemed like a long time to wait. Unless the chef is outside FISHING for the salmon and HEARDING the cows, I don't see why it would take this long. And not to mention that we didn't get all of our plates! We gave up on dessert!! \n\nOur waitress finally came to see us and inquire as to what was wrong (she saw us leaving our table). When briefly advised of what our sentiments were, her only response was \""The kitchen is backed up\"". Funny though, the table of 6 that walked in after us and got served before us seemed to be getting everything in a timely manner. Once being brought our bill, the waitress hovered over us like a hawk until we paid our bill. That was definitely awkward. \n\nAfter this whole disasterous evening, to top everything off, my girlfriend was so intensely sick we didn't know what to do. So if you want to pay money for  a stressful evening with horrible service, this is definitely the place to be."
0;"I always shop at Costco, but this location is the worst managed store that I have been to in the entire country.\n\nMeat Department:\nThe meat department is the absolute worst managed department in the store.\n-The counters are always empty and disorganized.\n-I always find expired meat and seafood on the counters that are far past their sell by date.\n-The manager of the meat department is extremely rude, as well as most of the staff behind the window.\n-They thaw out frozen seafood and raw seafood in the same sink at times.\n-They take the expired frozen seafood and thaw it out to sell as fresh seafood.\n-When they have the Seafood Road Show, they sell you the lobster tails frozen and it increases the price due to the extra water weight.\n-I have seen a meat cutter drop meat on the floor and then pick it up and continue to use it.\n-The stock on the counters are constantly being rearranged. There is no consistency as far as wear the meat and seafood are placed on the counter. \n\nBakery;\n-Absolutely disgusting. The baking trays are reused without ever being washed.\n-The wash machine is used continuously without the water being replaced with fresh water. This is a machine that recycles the water. When the trays and mixing bowls are not rinsed off and the water is not changed it just keeps washing with filthy water.\n-If you look at the three compartment sink it is always filled with filthy water, trays, and utensils.\n-The floors are always filthy as well as the counter tops and the storage areas.\n\nFruit & Vegetable Cooler / Friit & Vegetable Section.\n-The cooler is usually a mess and disorganized.\n-I always find expired veggies.\n\nDeli:\n-The deli always seems to be clean.\n-The manager and the staff are very helpful and friendly.\n-One thing I have a problem with is that they do not rinse the whole chickens off before they cook them in the rotisserie ovens.\n-I also don't like that they share the same walk in cooler with the meat department. There is always raw mets and cooked food near each other.\n\nFreezer Section:\n-The freezers always seem to be well stocked and organized.\n\nThe Food Isles & Other Shelves:\n-The shelves always seem to be well stocked and organized.\n\nTire Shop:\n-Good prices on tires and installation.\n-The staff is fairly quick and pleasant.\n\nFood Court:\n-The line is always too long.\n-There is no organized system for the customers to wait in line.\n-Everything they serve at the food court is inexpensive and tastes great!!\n\nRegisters:\n-As always at any Costco the people that work the registers are lightning fast. This company has the most efficient check out areas of any supermarket or big box store.\n\nGas Station:\n-Costco gas always seems to be about ten cents cheaper then all of the has stations in the area.\n\n********************************************************\nThe Costco return policy is unmatched by any of their competitors. The absolute best customer service when it comes to returns.\n\nCostco has a great online store. Especially when it comes to furnishing your home.\n\n********************************************************\n\nI love shopping at Costco, but avoid this locations meat department and bakery at all costs. Absolutely disgusting."
1;This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. The first time I came here I had the pick 2 combo whch was enchiladas.  the 2nd time I was here was on New Years Day after filling up on $1 beer in the sports book. \nI dont remember what my bf ordered but I went with Beef Fajitas. The plate came out sizzling hot and smelled very good. I dont really eat tortillas but it came with a side plate of rice and beans. the beans are kinda runny and the rice is very much like what you would get out of the box of rice-a -roni. Well I love san francisco as much as the next person but this was not my fave rice but after a few beers it wasnt too bad. \nThe fajitas were very small portioned. I know my bf took several stabs at my food but compared with other places I think I'd rather order something else next time. I guess I'm just so used to taking a box home to go- and this time .. there was no box to pack and it was rather greasy. \n\nBetter yet to go to Los compadres on Trop and order some fajita meat to cook up or order some of their ready made food.
4;I thougt is was pretty good...Im wondering if some of the negative review are from the restaurant and bar right next door... I love that place too but I wouldnt put it past their regular patrons.
4;Rick the Pool Dude is the main dude I would trust with my pool. I've had some issues with previous companies and Rick is the most knowledgable of the business. From a minor leak I had to maintaining my pool, Rick does a great job.  He is prompt and gets the job done how it should be. I wouldn't call anyone else but Rick the Pool Dude.
4;What makes The Birthday Suit unique is that THEY CARE. I have been to countless salons where you are just a number or they look at your ticket see your name and pretend they remember you. Stacy will always remember you and it makes going to your next visit like visiting a friend not just going to another appointment. \n\nWhere do I start, have to say the customer service. I have seen Stacy every time and she is simply amazing. She is so friendly and makes you feel so comfortable (when you would think being  1/2 naked on a table baring all you wouldn't be). I have been waxing for years back in my home town but the wax that is use here much better and less painful. Stacy takes pride in her work and does such a great job even with my stubborn leg hairs, I am a challenge and she wins every time! Knowing you can go back if you ever need a touch up is great, but I have yet needed to go back. \n\nThe children's room is such a great idea for those moms just wanting to keep up with waxing without the expense of a sitter, A+ for that idea. They have great products from the body scrub (that I use daily) to the lotion that actually moisturizes and all great prices and there is always a deal going on you can catch for a discount. \n\nPrices are very reasonable and no excuse to not afford it because they have countless deals and promotions, check them out on FaceBook or just call for deals. \n\nThis Yelper Highly Recommends The Birthday Suit
3;Very good Greek salad and chicken tortilla soup.  Much better option than chilli's and other airport restaurants.  I will eat here again.
1;Beware of this place,  great service, loved the decor.  I was there about 2 weeks ago and I sat at a nice table with my girlfriend. We shared  a calamari appetizer and then the tortellini pasta.  We dont drink alcohol so it was only around $50.  Everything was nice until we headed back to our room at the Bellagio.  Where we spent the rest of the night taking turns hugging the toilet.  The worst case of Food Poisoning I have ever had.  I did call and notify the restaurant and they said they will take care of it???  Ok great,   what a drag.  I didnt ask for my money back,  just trying to save anyone else from ruining their Vegas trip.  They have a record of the incident if yelp decides to filter this.
4;If u don't what to travel to shady side walnut street Starbucks go to the one in east liberty. You will have the same great feeling. I been going there since it first open it's doors. But I do still go to the mama and pa coffee houses in the area too. Long live East Liberty!!!
2;Tom's really went downhill when it merged with Folino's. Now the food is way overpriced, and the ambience of the former location is gone. It's still the go-to place for food on the south side at 4 a.m., but it will never be the same as it once was.
4;Cant say enough good things about this place.  I have been here twice and the food has been perfect every time.  the first time i had a new york strip which was amazing, but i was drunk when i had it so my taste could of been altered. The second time i was sober and it was confirmed that the food is awesome.  Get the filet mignon with merlot butter!!! It will melt in your mouth and maybe even tear up cause you have never tasted anything so good!  My fiance had the sea scallops which were good as well.  For an app we had the warmed goat cheese in a tomato sauce, nom nom!!!  Didnt expect anything less from a vegas restaurant.  Will definitely be back drunk or not ha.
3;"Great hotel, stayed here for two nights with family.  Not kid friendly, no strollers allowed unless you are a guest and the \""elegant\"" dining restaurants don't accept children younger then 5.  We got a king suite for $149 a night with a $50 resort credit.  Since we can't dine at the nicer places, we chose the buffet, which was a nice surprise.  Paid $35 a person, charged to room to use the resort credit.  Ate one too many alaskan crab legs and felt sick.  I still haven't manage to control myself at buffets.  No matter how slow or how little I get, I always wound up overeating.  I think the liege waffle pushed me over.  Watched alot of tourists munch on the pizza ($35 for cheese pizza?).  Hotel was able to provide a crib for our 10 month old.  It is a smaller crib, not the normal full size.  If you have a big baby, he/she might feel claustrophobic.  The bumper seems dense and worried me a little but our little one is not that mobile yet.  Overall suite was very nice, we had a view of Circus Circus.  The morning coffee was a disappointment.  Their coffee bar is right near the elevators and was a tad expensive for the type of coffee you get.  Don't get the breakfast croissant sandwiches, oily and greasy, felt ripped off for paying $9 for that crap.  Definitely would've given 5 stars if not for the limited dining choices and the sucky breakfast sandwiches (the grilled breakfast sandwich at Jean Phillippe in Bellagio was excellent)."
4;We did an ATV tour yesterday and had the most amazing time. The owners/tour guides are the most friendly thoughtful people I have met in a very long time. Our guide kept the speed appropriate for our group, took lots of pictures and videos and even stopped at a gas station on our way home. I would highly recommend using them because they offer the best rates along with the best service. Can't wait to come back and try another sport they provide!
2;It's important to know that Smashburger is more than just burgers.  As someone who doesn't eat hamburgers, I had never thought to check this place out until now.  You can get any of their burgers as either a grilled or crispy chicken sandwich.  Win!  (They also offer a veggie burger).  I ordered the local special, which came with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, and jalapeno slices.  Everything was very fresh, even the guacamole.  I was a little surprised at the size of the crispy chicken breast, as it seemed a tad small - I guess because I'm used to the super-sized ones you get at a lot of restaurants.  It was certainly more than enough food, just caught me off guard.\n\nOverall, it was a very good sandwich, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries as well.  The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that it's a little on the pricey side.  $12 for my sandwich, a water, and some sweet potato fries.  Not going to break the bank, but enough that I couldn't eat here for lunch every day.  I will say though that for the occasional treat it is worth it.  I do feel that the freshness and quality of the food justifies the price.
2;"Well, can honestly say I have always wanted to visit this place ever since I heard Jr.(Earnhardt) owned it. Being a huge Dale Eardhardt Jr Fan, its only natural to want to check this place out, good or bad reviews.\n\nFinding this place can be fun, its located on the second floor of a shopping area right along side the charlotte hornets arena. Be advised you probably will have to pay 6-8 dollars for parking and walk to the place.\n\nFirst of all i went here for lunch so this place was not \""hoppin\"", nor was it busy when i got there. The building seems to have two halves, a club side and a food side. THe club side was blocked off kind of and was empty. Walking in my first thoughts were kind of disappointing. Nothing really \""racey\"" feeling about it, yes i know its not a racecar bar but yet kind of figured it would have some kind of feeling reminding you what the place was about or where it came from.\n\nTypical bar style room with the bar in the center and tall tables around it. Waitress took at least 10 minutes to come greet us after we were seated. Then our order took good at least 20-25 minutes to arrive, she kept saying she was going to check on the status then would walk over to another table. The more guest our waitress had, the longer we had to wait for refills and our check. All the female workers seem close so they focused on gossiping  more with each other while they walk past our table failing to notice my empty glass could use a refill.\n\nFood was okay, had the \""Dale Q\"" i think it was called, was a burger with shredded pork on it. Really didnt have alot of taste to it, had to add the bbq sauce to give it some kind of taste. However i did order the waffle sweet potato fries and those were excellent!\n\nOverall i left kind of bummed, just guess i need to visit it at nighttime. It seems being open for lunch, they only run the bare minimum staff and that effects everyone as more guest arrive for lunch.\n\nOh side note, dont get too excited if you see the mason jar they offer with your soda drink for 8 bucks, its plastic and a total letdown. Asked if they offer glass like it looks like in the picture and she said no.....only to find glass ones for sale at the spot to buy hats and shirts....."
4;Ray and his team are awesome. Called to repair my disposal and they came right out. They Called to confirm, called when they were on their way. I had to cancel my appointment to pick up my son, but Ray made sure I was completed before I needed to leave so I didn't have to cancel. Just great service from beginning to end!
0;My dad gave me a groupon for this place, he was too jetlagged to go and I was more than happy to sign up for the free dinner. I made reservations, however I was told that their reservations were backed up until 9:00 pm. I confirm that time, and show up at 8:50. It's a madhouse, with people packing the tiny corridor leading from the bar to the restaurant. The greeter was screaming at the top of her lungs for people, managing to sound pretty pissed off in the process. \n\nWe were seated at 9:55, and this was after a handful of people in front of us left because of the wait. We sat around for a few minutes before someone slapped this cup of butter on the table. Me and my date sat transfixed. Was the butter ornamental? Would it go good with a dash of pepper? We stared at this shot glass full of butter for a full fifteen minutes before someone gave us bread. We were seated with two other tables simultaneously, and while we waited for our appetizer, the first table was on their entrees. The second table was polishing off their appetizer while we munched on prison bread. The butter didn't help much.\n\nI got the filet, medium rare. Completely raw in the middle, mostly raw for the rest of it. Baked potato was microwaved. A baked potato will be crispy on the outside. This is a direct result of the baking. A microwaved potato will be one big rubbery mess that slides around your plate. \n\nWe chose the peach melba for dessert. It was melted soft serve ice cream topped with cool whip and canned peaches. There were a few raspberries, but after the first one's extreme sourness I decided to leave the rest to drown in vanilla soup. The blueberries were completely devoid of any flavor, good or bad. If you've ever eaten paper, you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nAt the end, we were presented our check boasting that we would have had to pay $89.99 for this travesty. It was to show how much we should tip. The waitress was absent for most of the night, the service took forever, the reservations were an hour delayed, and the food was awful. The tip wasn't much.\n\nA few other notes. The interior is weird. I can figure why-- this is a dive tavern that someone picked up on the cheap for the nice location. They threw in a few large windows facing the city and left the rest to rot. I was able to carbon date the carpet back to the paleolithic age, when orange and green was in style. Every flat surface is full of drywall stalactites, which adds a nice sex-dungeon flair to the place. A fake fireplace crackles and flickers orange. The bathroom is worse than most I've seen barhopping on East Carson St., and if you've ever been to East Carson Street you know what I'm talking about.
1;Everything here sickly sweet and not well seasoned. I ordered the schezwan chicken and instead if something spicy it was chicken in a super sweet red-colored (most likely food coloring) sauce. On another occassion, I tried the bi bim bop. Also not spicy and a little on the bland side but at least it was edible. Asian fusion should keep the essence of the dish and recombine it in innovative ways. In order to do this you should have some concept of how the original, traditional dish tastes and is prepared. Most of the lulu's cookbook was created by someone who has never tasted or set eyes on the original dish and has only read a description of the dish.
0;They only had 3 people working on a Saturday afternoon, one person was doing a family members nails, when others were waiting  to receive a service. One of us received a pedicure right away while the other person waited with cold water for 20+ minutes. I would not recommend this place unless you have no other options.
4;Went on a Monday night with a friend who knew the bartender Jeremy so maybe my experience is a little bias, but the service, fiilm, and beer was beyond great. The vintage seats are grimy and probably filled with bed bugs but if you're like most of the hipsters that go here you probably won't care.
4;Last night I decided to venture out and order pizza from a new place I have never ordered before and after reading all the reviews from Pizza Natali I decided to give this place a chance.When it comes to pizza I very critical and reading the reviews on here helped me make this decision easier. I ordered the pizza through Pizza Natalis delivery website which was very easy to navigate and order from.It took about an hour to receive my pizza but once it was received I could smell the pizza from the box and it was just amazing.I ordered a pepperonia,italian sausage, and black olive baked crispy.It was full of flavor and so delicious I was almost inhaling the pizza it was that good. I highly recommend PIzza Natali over any chained pizzeria in the valley as all the ingredients are fresh and to me well it is what a pizza is supposed to be like.
0;Beyond disappointing....Wannabe Heaven...Overpriced ... Bunch of kids running the place... I wonder what it will be called next year after this one fails....
3;*3.5 Stars*\n\nThis street that Mikado is located is hip, jiving, and what a great atmosphere! I loved how most restaurants made use of the sidewalk and put mini patios, but without making the space cramped. \n\nMy bf mentioned that this used to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but the same owners decided to turn it into Japanese (?). Even though we arrived pretty late, the place was still packed. After we sat down, there were more people coming in. Because we weren't that hungry, my bf and I decided to order a couple of things to share: Agedeshu Tofu, Cod, and several rolls. Over all, the food was good.\n\nI loved the service. It was personable, and efficient, yet unhurried. A gentleman (part owner perhaps?) was patient in describing what their most popular dishes were.\n\nThis is my first Japanese restaurant I tried in Montreal (and I am sure there are a lottttt more), but I wouldn't mind coming back here. It's in a great part of town and the food and service is great.
4;I called Mike to repair our Kitchen Aid refrigerator.  He was able to fit the repair call in his schedule and was very prompt.  He offered me options with regards to the repair as well as his professional opinion.  Mike is a highly experienced professional and brings years of expertise.  I feel the fees were very fair for the work that was required and would not hesitate to call Mike again.
3;Pretty good place to eat a burger, Without spending too much.
0;First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.
4;The blue flame is probably one of their best rolls! They are to die for. Love this place. But I go to the one in Goodyear
2;The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade. \n\nI'll be honest, I wasn't that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardson's/Rokerji/Dick's Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? I'll take any number of places including the Garage across the street. I'm just not sure where Z Tejas fits. \n\nThe food is exactly what you would expect, pretty good, not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota, this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings, always a positive to make things easier on the diners. \n\nThe southwest slaw (I think that's what it's called) was one of the worst things I've ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste.
0;We went here on a Tuesday morning for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n\nWell.... I ordered the special which was a tuna melt. I traditional tuna melt is tuna salad with cheese melted on top and its warm.  My friend ordered steak & eggs. \nMy tuna melt came out as fried tuna without mayo and it was fishy!\n\nSo..... about 15 minutes goes by and someone comes over to my table who appears to be the owner and said we don't have any more steak would you like something else?\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture? WOW REALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOh and did I forgot to mention our waiter was clueless! He stood behind us while we were ordering, he didn't even make eye contact. He also has no clue on how to be a server. \n\nFirst and Last Time at this place!
3;I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.
0;I have out-of-town guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance.  I even reminded them of the appointment last week.  They assured me they would be there.  When no one showed up, I started calling: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours past their appointment time.  Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails.  I am really, really disappointed.
0;so i drove by there the other day. they closed. no surprise there, and no big loss. better luck next time.
1;If you enjoy sneezing for an hour after you wake up, this is the place for you.  The air in the apartments during the winter is so dry that you need to put pots of water on the heater to make it bearable.  While they have recently redone the lobby area, the rooms are still very much lacking.  I would not recommend these apartments to anyone other than hockey fans, as it was nice to be able to walk over and catch a hockey game anytime you like.
4;Great place to go for lunch. Absolutely the best Italian I've had. Great atmosphere and perfect service. Love this place.
3;So stumbled upon this new store on Craigslist when I was searching for fish to buy so here's the pros and cons \n\nPros: \nService: Great staff and service,the staff greeted me the first step I took into the store and love to chat and help you out with any question.\n \nFish: This store only carry saltwater fish and even  tho when I was there their fish selection was a lil meager but what they had in the tanks was healthy and the price was far since it was a fairly new store it was very clean \n\nCorals: they have a huge selection of corals and the price are not bad either \n\nCons:\n\nService: none \n\nFish: I guess they have been busy cos for the past two times I been in they where low on small to mid size fish and they where two weeks apart\n\nCorals: will I bought a Maximus clam and it had three aiptasia on it so make sure you check what your getting thoroughly!
1;Am I in New Jersey?\n\nI'm not?\n\nAre you sure?\n\nI can't even see the strip from here, I don't believe you.\n\nThat guy has a fucking Ed Hardy tattoo. I'm definitely in Jersey right now.
1;"Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre's because of a Groupon. \n\nWait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.\n\nWe had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.\n\nFor entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the \""Tia's Enchiladas\"" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not \""huge\"".\n\nFor desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.\n\nThen the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn't know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.\n \nOverall, it was typical mexican food with a \""modern\"" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its \""modern\"") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town."
4;My husband and I ate here on our way home from Vegas. I looked for an Indian restaurant on Yelp with good reviews and Yelp saved the day again by leading us to this wonderful gem. They have meat, vegetarian and vegan options. The buffet was huge and delicious. Everything is clearly labeled whether it's vegan or vegetarian, too, which was so helpful. I could only wish to find this wonderful of a vegan friendly Indian restaurant in L.A. I am on the hunt! I will be eating here everytime I visit Vegas!
4;They do have vegetarian tacos, their potato taco is delicious!! And they also have vegetarian tamales, only on weekends! A must !!!
3;A must visit when you are in the downtown area!  Love this place!  When you go to the top, it shows the Vegas Strip (which is best seen at night).  I never experienced the rides, but did go to the show and love the casino itself.
0;The food was ok. The restraunt area was way to open. Chips and Salsa was really good the main meal not as much...
4;For 18 dollars they do a phenomenal haircut, which includes a neck shave and massage. Crazy right? I always feel guilty and over tip. Best barber shop in downtown Phoenix.
4;If you haven't been here, get off Yelp, stop looking at pics, and go!!!!!! I personally think they should have their own shop outside of 7th St. market. I've been wanting to get some of this coffe for so long but couldn't figure out where it was lol. I just happened to be in 7th St. market one Saturday and...BAM!! There it is. So my mom and I had to sit down for a cup. We had great service and great coffee. Nice atmosphere right at the bar, but everything else around is kind of a distraction. (Except for Pure Pizza). Overall it's great coffee! Check it out!
4;i've been making my way through the cheaper mexican restaurants around town for years and was just introduced to this place- I hope I'll never have to go anywhere else.  The tiny, rustic atmosphere makes you feel like you just left madison and wandered into mexico accidentally and the enormous delicious portions are so cheap- exactly the kind of unique experience that makes this place stand out.
3;What a great experience.  So happy we weren't let down.  We were customers of Aiello's when they were open (same Owners) and always had a great meal.\nHad the fish & chips & fries and it was great.  The fish was so mild and fresh and the breading was delicious...not over breaded.  My husband had the burger and I tasted it (of course) and agreed with him, that it was a winner.  The dessert we had was the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce and it was a home run!!  Of course, the best part of the whole experience was Brian, who always took care of us at Aiello's and now is at Charr.  We will definitely be returning.....many times!!
0;"Make them give you a truck with gas in it.  I got a truck with only a quarter tank left and got no credit for filling it so that I knew I had enough gas to do what I needed.   $86 of gas and all I got was \""If you overfill, it's your problem\""  Well, it's also going to be your problem because I will never be back and I will be posting reviews like this one anywhere I can find.  Wish there was a zero stars option."
2;$1 beer was nice, but wing was  hard as rock, I asked if this was harder than usual but they said that was the one I should enjoy...  not for me.
4;"What a nice place to hang out. Their remodels reduced none of the charm, and improved their service. Do yourself a favor and camp out when you go; it's comfy like a couch."
2;"Must say upon entering the building was a little confused...I thought this was an Irish Pub? Decor is sport bar/ rock and roll/ dive bar with nice wood bar and tables and chairs. Music was everything from country to Rap..no bagpipes...lol  Waitstaff wore what looked like they were supposed to be kilts (or kilt-like). They were super short with bras to match. Might as well been at Hooters. Menu definately was not Irish pub, they don't even have fish and chips...   But, I must say..service was prompt and attentive.\nI guess I spoke soon. I was still in the establishment while  writing this review. BF went to the mens restroom and he was totally disgusted. Said it smelled like a \""drive in bathroom\"" and was very dirty. Also...service got worse the longer we were there. With only 4 people left in the whole placed she never noticed I was out of a drink for almost 15 minutes. (I was even to the restroom and back)\n\"""
0;Way disappointed!  Food was garden variety mexican.  Our waitress was not interested.  And my biggest pet peeve of leaving the table full of dirty dishes while we were left sitting there trying to pay our bill topped off a forgetful evening in Scottsdale.  Go somewhere / anywhere else for a better expenditure of your time and money.
1;Very expensive and average. Every other restaurant in our casino was jammed so we went here. Food was ok. My shrimp dish was $25+ for only five shrimp! No pasta/rice or anything else with it. Ridiculous. To top it off, warm beer. Only upside was good service.
3;Excellent service, atmosphere, and food.  Started at the bar and had an excellent whiskey sour.  Made with an egg white and topped with bitters it was excellent.  We had the tasting menu.  One vegetarian and one non vegetarian.  Each course was tasty with excellent presentation.  Plenty of food but not so much that we left stuffed.  The wait staff knew the menu well including ingredients and preparation.  We will be back for sure!
0;If you go here to by a car do this: \n1)by some water-based, non irritating lubricant \n2)research positions that are the most comfortable for when you're getting screwed\n3)if you're turned on by lying, swindling and games, these clowns are for you!\n\nFor starters,hopefully douchebag Johnny lemke is gone from this dealership. Had two back-to-back horrible business deals with this Chapman Autoplex and will not, I repeat, WILL NOT, ever be back. I got cornholed bigtime on my last Dodge in 2003. Me and a couple other co-workers bought from a sneaky and unscrupulous sales woman named Kim Chartier back in 98 or so and I should have learned back then not to come back to this dealership. All of us got screwed in so many ways that it will take me two hours to state what happened. Years later, we still joke about this dealership and how bad we got it. My friend Debbie L bought two or three used vehicles from Kim C and she almost needed therapy when she realized how bad she got screwed, and she could have saved alot of money buying from someone else.I turned in a leased car back to them in 2003 (dont ever lease-sales reps make more commission on leases) therefore I was talked into one when I could have bought the car for $10 more a month. Costly mistake.  And before my lease on my Dodge Neon ended and I still had another payment left, they talked me into ending my lease a month early so i can get sold another Dodge-well they were supposed to make my last lease payment for me and of course, they didn't, and I got stuck with two payments for one month. Also, my interest rate was almost a point higher than I was quoted over the phone-when I went to sign the Chrysler Financial papers, the sales manager was no where to be found, and someone else was left in charge of it. When I confronted the sales manager the next day,  he said I could have free car detailing for the entire time I owned the car!! What good is this when I am not coming back??  I should have walked when the interest rate was higher than he told me over the phone but but I needed a car, was in a bind,  and wanted this horrible experience over with. I was also sold a useless extended warranty that I could have negotiated down in price, but once again, the gal that sold me this made her money and thats all that matters.  After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork, and another issue with my turned in leased car, I called to complain to the head manager, Johnny Lemke- what a jerk, very rude to me, and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing, they won't honor it.I will never buy a Dodge again, never buy an extended warranty-they are a scam and don't cover anything, and I will never deal with this dealership again.  After my experience with them and some issues with my turned in leased vehicle, I got to fight ANOTHER battle with Wells Fargo Auto Lease Finance-totally different story there but I won it, with no help  from the Chapman fu**tards. This dealership did nothing to guide me through turning in my leased vehicle either- I  think they should have recommended me do some stuff as I was buying another  vehicle from them. Nope. You need to do your research on turning in a leased vehicle and don't expect anyone at the dealership to save you any money or give you any useful advice. You need to ask the bank that you're leasing from, where their lot is and turn the vehicle in there. If you leave it at Chapman or another dealership, you will be charged a pick up fee. I ended up beating this and not paying but don't rely on the dealership to make this an easy transition. I hope the knuckleheads that were here back in 2003 are gone. And by the way, my junk Dodge Stratus was totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver- the POS was an even bigger POS and insurance paid it off and paid my GAP insurance so I got rid of the car and wasn't stuck with it any longer. Words of advice: do not lease, do not purchase extended warranties, do not do business with Chapman, and buy from private sellers people- it is cheaper and they are more honest. Run a carfax too.
2;What is all the hype for this place? Came here for breakfast and was so disappointed!  Obviously breakfast is not their forte or I there would be more reviews here aside from their evening menu....\n\nThe chilli con carne.... overrated.  Yeah, I said it. The meat tasted like it came straight out of a can. \n\nThe toastada special was alright, but ive had better. Unfortunately for everyone at my table it was the only thing with flavor. \n\nThe home fries tasted like they sprinkled cheezeits on them. What are these batteted with?\n\nThe breakfast burrito was just OK. \n\nHonestly if I were here again I would have to save my appetite strictly for dinner only. But breakfast? I'll pass.
2;Some people love this place, but I don't really get it.  The whole thing about George Street clubs (especially Opal Lounge) being full of ex-Etonians in their coat tails and top hats is just a fallacy and it generally attracts normal people looking for a good night.\nMy problem with Opal is that the dancefloor just feels wrong! It's difficult to describe but it's almost got a garden shed sort of feel.  The floor is sticky as hell and there's always broken glass all over it.  Everyone just seems so dour and moody as soon as they get on the Opal dancefloor as well for some reason!\nOther than that the drinks are usually well priced and the staff are quick at zapping the queues.  I've never had an outstanding night here, but I know plenty who have.
1;I like their selection, but their customer service is amateur hour.
1;Dry cleaning is over twice as expensive as the cleaners I use back home in Chicago.\n\nAlso I have had two shirts come back heavily starched, when I requested no starch.\n\nTheir service has always been very prompt, which is why I didn't leave just one star.
3;"Cool, pseudo-underground bar in Madison. Very unique decor, and mysterious lighting. They usually have a DJ on busy nights.\n\nFood is good- good asian-ish selection of snacks. Three cup chicken/tofu is solid, along with their pizza selections.\n\nThey have a pretty solid drink menu; good liquor selection and interesting beers on tap.\n\nIf they started accepting credit cards, this place would blow up. Maybe that's intentional; don't think it could handle much more people."
3;Great Service, Great Burgers minus the fries :) oh and Animal Style, at a Great Price!!!  They take pride in their food and customer service and it shows.
1;We had the crab-pineapple dip with wontons for an appetizer. Crab and pineapple in a tasteless white goo, really a bad idea. We really did not want to put together our idea of a bowl of food, but that's the way it works. The beef in our dish had several pieces of gristle, and the rest of the dish was a bit overcooked for my taste. We did try several of the sauces but none did anything worthy of mention. The chocolate-filled wantons with a whipped cream side were very good, and my extra-dirty traditional gin martini was very cold and surprisingly good. Service is friendly but untrained. Several times our server should have seen we needed extra plates or silverware, but she was oblivious. We were sadly disappointed.
4;Had a flat tire on our trailer while on vacation. AAA recommended a place 20 miles away that we had to drive to on the flat. Yea right. I yelped for a tire shop and this place came up as 3.5 miles away. Hubby called and they had 4 of the correct tires in stock. They got us in immediately and charged us a cheaper price than AAA quoted.
2;***disclaimer: my friend Melissa B. loves this place (please see her review). I think the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I have gone with her and she's a damn good time!***\n\nWith that disclaimer being said, I had an good time there. I mean, the music wasn't bad, and if you have a table, it's a lot more enjoyable. I do like the decor, it's really nicely done inside, and has some pretty decent people watching. I also love the fact that it's very close to my house.\n\nNice stuff said, now it's time for the criticism: it's somewhat ridiculous. A bit pretentious and too expensive!! Cheapest glass of wine: $9. Martinis: $12. My poor friend had $12 vodka red bull. This is not the place to go if you're looking to get a little sloshed or are not a cheap date. \n\nI will go there again, yes, because my friends LOVE it (see Eric P.'s review as well) and it makes me feel like I'm in a chicago lounge. But, I think my warnings should be heard. :)
1;Not impressed...I was in Scottsdale for a few days on business and decided to get a relaxing pedicure in my free time.  After reading the reviews I decided to try Pro Nails by Julie.  When I called to make an appt I specifically asked for Julie since she is the one mentioned in most of the reviews.  The place is clean and they do have a nice selection of colors.  I sat down in the chair and was given a bottle of water which is a nice touch but when it came to the cuticle clipping and filing it was awful.  She hardly clipped my cuticles at all and she filed my toenails crooked and they were all different lengths!! This is Julie, the owner? I live in Southern CA and you can go to any nail shop and get a better job for a much better price.  I paid $33 for basically a polish change and a little lotion on my legs and the massage that other Yelpers reviewed about being so good? ummm not so much...I really wish Bliss wasnt booked solid I would have gladly paid an extra $20 for a good job.
3;Janet Lynn's was pretty much my entry into fine dining as I grew up and went to university, as an incredibly classy and romantic anniversary. It's been my go to place for special occasions ever since. \n\nThe menu doesn't change much but the service is just so attentive that It keeps me going back. The room is lovely and maybe a bit stuffy, but it is a welcome change from the restaurants that are closer to the universities. I did feel out of place at first because we were the youngest people there, but our waitress was so nice and helpful with everything on the menu/wine list.\n\nWhen the food came I did scarf it down (possibly to the chagrin and scoffing of the table next to us) but it was so delicious. The duck and chicken were so delicious as was the creme brulee for dessert.\n\nForget Symposium for first dates, take him/her to Janet Lynn's for something romantic, memorable and elegant.
1;It was great the last few times...\n till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them.
4;Obsessed with Postinos! I live right down the street from there and frequent it quite often. I'm a vegetarian so it's sometimes difficult for me to eat places but at Postino's they have wonderful meat-free bruschetta options. They also have excellent Sangria for those who are looking for a lighter fruity alternative to wine. I like to go there on Sunday's and drink $5 Sangria pints and listen to the reggae band. So fun!
0;"A group of 7 of us went on a Tuesday night to celebrate our friend's birthday. It was a disaster from the beginning. The waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink. She also failed to notice that one of our guests had accidentally spilled his soda and commented to the spiller \""wow! you're really sucking those down let me grab you another one\"" and left him in a wet mess. Out of all 7 of us, only the birthday girl's entree was messed out [talk about some bad birthday luck!]. The salmon she ordered wasn't fully cooked! And she's not a fan of sushi... The waitress didn't apologize and just said \""oh, i'll take it to the kitchen so they can fix it.\"" Our birthday girl had a chat with the manager to let him know that we were a little \""miffed\"" by the [lack of] service to say the least. The manager said he would send us a new waitress and comp her uncooked salmon. We never got a new waitress and when she brought us the bill she proclaimed \""wow! for some reason my manager gave ya'll a 25% discount! you guys must be stoked!\"" ...On the way out, one of our guests overheard her telling a fellow waitress that \""I heard heroin isn't bad for you so I do it from time to time.\"" \n\nJust another example of why drugs are bad for you kids."
3;My wife and I had a craving for Middle Eastern food. I checked on Yelp and found this place where our friends could meet us halfway. They bailed, but we went ahead and enjoyed a delicious meal. \nIt was a bit strange to be eating in an old 5 and Diner restaurant. None of the ambiance was changed except for the addition of the TV and water pipes lining the wall. We were there for the food.\nWe started off with the Baba Ghannoughe. The pit bread was okay and the Baba Ghannoughe was oily but edible. \nMy wife ordered a cup of Lintel soup with her Chicken Sharawma sandwich. The soup was excellent and she ordered a bowl to go which looked like a cup instead of a bowl. \nHer sandwich was okay...we got spoiled at Sabuddy when it was in Tempe and and then in Scottsdale, their sandwich was in the pocket of the pita bread and not wrapped like a burrito.\nI ordered the Shish Kafta which was 3 pieces of ground beef and lamb char-broiled with a side of onions & tomato and white rice topped with currant raisins. The meat was cooked just right...firm & flavorful and the rice was okay. It's a good thing I didn't eat lunch 'cause there were good portions on my plate.\nWe topped it off with Baklava...mmmm...so good.
3;Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!
2;Pretty good burger! Good beer selection & happy hour prices. We shared the Juicy Lucy - it was cooked just right and had nice gooey, melty cheese inside that oozed out when we cut into it. We had the tater tots which were really good. Love when they are cooked just right and come out perfectly golden brown and hot and crispy all around. While the quality seemed ok it lacked a bit of flavor. Had to season it pretty good with salt and pepper - but that can go both ways. I do like to season my own food so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. If or when we are back in the area we'd stop in again.
2;Doesn't offer the all you can eat prime rib as of end of august.\nHowever there is enough on the single order to satisfy the average person.
3;Stopped in Sunday after the recommendation of a friend.  It was blazing hot outside and the A/C in my house wasn't keeping up with it, so I needed a cold beer, cool air, and sports.  This is the place.  I would call this a true sports bar.  Great atmosphere, very friendly and attentive bar tenders, and pleanty of TV's with a wide variety of sports shown.  Just what I was looking for.  Oh yeah, the A/C worked perfectly too. \n\nI had a pizza while watching two baseball games and the golf tournament. The pizza was pretty good, not great, but I ate it all so it was good enough.  Great crust.  The menu seemed to have some other things that looked good. I heard somebody down the bar mention the Calzone was good so next time.  Another guy had some good looking wings too.\n\nJust as I was leaving, a major thunder storm blew up so I turned around and had another beer.  \n\nGreat place to hang out and have a few brews and a bite while watching a game.   I'll be back very soon.
2;I dont get why a bunch of people are complaining about the Excalibur. Don't hate dudes! You guys need to look at the star rating of hotels before you actually decide to book. If you are dishing out about $85 a night for a 3 star hotel, dont expect 5 F'in star service.  Not to mention you are located on the hottest corner of LV, which is Tropicana and the Strip. Leave your room for christ sakes!\n\nThe room itself was just a room. You get a bed, it smells good and theres one non-high definition TV. View out the window was a parking lot. Fortunately there were elevators that take you up to your room, no stair climbing necessary. The bathrooms were spacious and huge shower areas for those manage sessions with anyone you bring back. Just a word of caution, they do check key cards for everyone going up to the rooms area. Make sure you have your key on you at all times! \n\nOther then that..do all of your clubbing, eating and gambling across the street at MGM or NY NY. They are all walking distance.
4;I went on this with my mother and we absolutely loved the Graveyard tour. I can't remember out tour guide's name, but he was fabulous. I was enthralled and couldn't stop listening! He was very informative about what we were seeing as we walked around town and shared info about the history- both accurate and kind of disturbing... This town has some haunted history. \n\nTour guide even showed us some extra fun stuff after the tour was over- their school that inspired JK Rowling for her vision of Hogwarts and the grave of Thomas Riddle in Greyfriars. \n\nI'd absolutely recommend this tour to anyone wanting to learn some history and like the darker side of it. Much better than the Real Mary King's Close tour... After this tour, the close just seemed awful and hokey.
4;Super delayed review but the hubby and I went to Gallagher's last summer during our annual trek to Vegas to celebrate the birthdays. It was during Las Vegas Restaurant week. Hubby tried the Filet Mignon which he really enjoyed, a tender piece and very tasty. I had the rib-eye which had perfect marbling and an out-of-this-world flavor! Both were good size cuts. We shared the Four Cheese Macaroni, Creamed Spinach and Yukon potatoes for sides, all were delish! As tasty as our meals were, the highlight was definitely the service. Our waiter was super attentive, friendly and offered spots to visit whilst in town (though we're not Vegas rookies). We're heading back this summer and will absolutely be returning to Gallaghers!
3;People here are extremely nice, which is the reason why I upped this an extra star. Poke here though is a bit mediocre. I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn't as good as the other Poke I've been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you're expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can't really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.\n\nWe ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay. We came here to bring a bunch of poke because we don't have anything like that around the bay. Anyways we had the squid, ahi garlic, and pretty much all the other ahi flavors. I might come back here and give this place another shot just because how awesome the owners are here and my theory about coming to this place late might be right.\n\nOwners keep up the friendly service. Service really matters when coming to any place!
1;Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good.
3;"Just bought a home and decided to use Wave House based on the yelp reviews. I didn't scrutinize the job right away as I had many other companies coming out for bids on work that needed to be done to the home so I was pretty tied up to really inspect it. But it appeared to be clean.\n\nLater that evening i saw the stove and showers were not cleaned very well at all. There was alot of soap and hard water residue left behind, I could run my hand over the tiles and my hand was very chalky. The stove was still pretty crusty also. \nThe office mgr., Melissa (I beleive) followed up the next day on the cleaning, I explained my disappointment and she immediately offered for the girls to come back and rectify it. I initially declined, and then later decided to have them come back. \n\nThey came out the next day and re-cleaned the stove and only 1 of the showers. I didn't say anything about the 2nd shower to them as I already felt very uncomfortable  about them coming back to re-clean, knowing that I complained about their cleaning.  (I really don't like addressing a job that is not well done with someone, they look at you cross, like how dare you complain about the job I performed) \n\nLater that night I started to unpack the boxes and get my house in order and that's when I really started noticing how dirty everything was still. I paid  for a deep move in clean. There was no furniture in the house so nothing in the way of them being able to clean all the nooks and crannies. I paid extra for all the windows, sliders and inside the cabinets and fridge to be cleaned.  They missed several cabinets shelves all together, that were very very dusty and cleaned the others poorly. There was still dirt & crumbs in several of the drawers, and dirt in corners of the cabinets. \n\nThe slider and window tracts were supposed to be cleaned as part of the window cleaning that I paid extra for, they were not cleaned very well, there was still dirt & grime in them. There was debris/particles all along the baseboards, in every room, that were not vacuumed. Dirt left in corners of the tile floors. They did a surface clean, but not a very thorough deep clean, which is what I paid for. I wanted it sparkling and sanitized, and it is not even close.\n\nMelissa did call after they came back out to follow up and I just let it go to voicemail and didn't call back to say anything about what I was seeing. I know they can't fix it if i don't say something, but I didn't want them to send out the same girls again and I have to point out all the areas they didn't clean properly, it is extremely unnerving to have to do that. \n\nI would give them 1 star based on their cleaning abilities. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because of Melissa's customer service skills. I would never use them again and feel it was a complete waste of $220.\n\nI would recommend that if there are issues with a cleaning that you send out someone else so the customer is not dealing with \""glares\"".\n\n\n**Owner contacted me after seeing the review, he offered me a few different options to rectify the situation. I have decided to change my review to 4 stars from 2, due to the customer service I received in response to the situation. No one is perfect, but they were willing to make sure I was taken care of and satisfied, that is all you can ask for from a company. I would give them another opportunity to clean my home."
3;This is probably the cheapest buffet I've ever been to. Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place. Just remember to make the best deal out of a buffet, make sure you come hungry.
3;Very good, cheap Chinese food. Lots of specials including beer. \n\nThe only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons' tables. If this is a regular occurrence, get the food to go.
3;I really like what The Huxley have done to this space, and especially on their menus: both food, and cocktail. \n\nPreviously the Rutland Bar, which had been around for a fair while, a makeover and change of name can do the world of good. I always liked the Rutland, but it felt very much like a bar to have meetings in, or a subdued drink. \n\nThe Huxley has a great vibe midweek. I've yet to visit at the weekend. But yknow what? As far as a bar for a mid-week after-work drink and munchies goes, it's pretty good. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and hot dogs. I will be back to try these (the burgers come with two patties per bun?!)\n\nWhen I came, I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and it was really fresh and delicious. When a bar isn't specifically a 'cocktail bar' I can be very suspicious. So many times a cocktail can come unmuddled, or with chunky ice instead of crushed, and it can just taste like watery, alcohol with a sprinkling of fruit. Not at The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist at the bar, who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some cocktails for me. I love this kind of energy and passion. There were some delicious looking numbers there too.\n\nThe food menu is also really unusual, inspired and different. Hot dogs are, well, so hot right now. But there were also nibbles like Poached Duck Egg with black pudding and chorizo. Or a Scotch Dug Egg with HP sauce. Or Mini Chipolatas with dip, which I had. And the Battered Sole, with a side of seaweed salad.\n\nNote: do not put half the seaweed salad in your mouth at once. It tastes like the sea. Like the sea and fish. I used to have a through-and-through phobia of fish. It was not pleasant. I am assured, however, that a little nibble of the seafood salad is quite pleasant.\n\nThe Huxley is a new bar, and new bars take a while to settle into themselves. I hope it goes from strength to strength, however, as you can see they've put a lot of thought into the new food menu, the cocktail menu, and the new decor.\n\nNow, when can I go back for a burger?
4;Visiting from LA, looked for a place to eat late at night and found this place. Would recommend the Champion burger, pulled pork fries, sunrise biscuit, and beignets
1;"I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews people have given this place on Yelp.  People talked about how great the food was and how fair the price was for all-you-can-eat sushi; however, my experience with this place was thoroughly disappointing.  I gave this place a 2nd star as a benefit of the doubt.. perhaps I just happened to have picked a bad day to eat at this place.\n\nFirst, the service was HORRIBLE.  We asked for a table for 3, and instead of simply pulling an extra chair up two a 2-seated table, the waitress sat us at a table for 6, only to have a party of 8 walk in the door a minute after I had started on my soup, so she asked us to move to a different table so they could have our table.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it was the only problem we ran into for the night.\n\nNext, because the staff was in such a rush to move us, they took my salad away before I was actually finished with it.  Not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience.\n\nThird, when we put in our sushi order, the waitress had to clarify whether we were ordering nigiri per order (2 pieces) or per piece.  We specified that we wanted 2 pieces for every number we indicated on the sushi sheet.  She nodded and brought our order to the chef.  The first half of our order came out fine. We got the number of pieces we asked for, but when the 2nd half of our order came out, the sushi chef decided to interpret our orders as \""per piece\"" so we only received one piece of every sushi ordered on the bottom half of the order sheet.  I guess it's no big deal, since we could always order more, but it took us a good 45 minutes just to get all of this order, we didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to order everything again.  \n\nThe staff was also bad with keeping up with who they had already served soup & salad to and who they have not served yet (I happened to receive mine, but the person who showed up later in our group got nothing), and they were slow at refilling drinks too.  It might be because they got busy after the 1st hour we were there, but we wouldn't have dined for 2.5 hours if their service wasn't as slow.  \n\nAlso, the three sushi chefs who were working all disappeared at the same time, and were gone for about 5 minutes.  What kind of restaurant leaves the sushi bar completely unattended during the peak dinner hour?!?!?!\n\nAside from the service, the food selection was not great as it did not really include any appetizers, had limited all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and did not include any dessert.  We could've driven another 2 minutes down the block to another sushi restaurant that could've provided all the above mentioned items with same quality or even better quality fish than Sushi Kee for the same all-you-can-eat price of $20 per person.  \n\nAs for food quality, it was pretty decent.  It is among some of the freshest quality fish I've had in sushi restaurants, but there are definitely plenty of other places that could provide better quality fish as well.  The quality of Sushi Kee's fish is not enough to bring be back here again.\n\nIn summary, I would not go back to eat here knowing that Mido Sushi's only a block away.  I also would not recommend any of my friends to eat here either.  While the food quality was ok, the service and poor food selection definitely ruined the experience for me.  Had the service been better, I wouldn't mind recommending people to this place, but in all honesty, Mido Sushi truly can provide more options, better quality fish, and better service for the same exact price, so why waste time in trying this place out?"
0;"Oh also I have been trying to reach the managers for a week now, I tried 2 different managers multiple times and have left 4 voicemails with absolutely no response! So of you do stay here, do so at your own risk because if they start randomly charging your credit card hundreds of dollars like they did mine (and blaming it on \""computer glitches) don't expect their help to fix it!"
2;"Updating, since \""America\"" went above and beyond to resolve my customer service issue of not receiving the 10 percent locals discount, I am happy to revise my rating.\nAlways good to see a business respond so positively regarding customer satisfaction."
0;"Really, cleaning and changing the taps at noon, AKA \""lunch time\"" on a Friday?Downright stupid! Been 10 minutes waiting for a simple beer and the taps are still not assembled. Anticipating they'll taste like soap :-("
1;Ok, I'll start by saying this hotel isn't horrible. But it is not at all nice. It smells powerfully from fresheners, which means they are covering some not good stuff. Yikes! It's also pretty smokey.\nVery, very dated. Seriously 70s/80s fabulous, for better or for worse.\nOur bathtub was squishy--yes squishy from it not being sealed properly and water draining underneath it.\nPeople working were pretty nice, but some were grumpy toward us.\nThe conference area wasn't good. Some rooms were saunas and others ice boxes. There was no internet connection as promised in many areas.  The hallways were hard to walk down. Technology help was sparse and slow. Technology capabilities left much to be desired.\nWe wouldn't ever stay here again if we came to Vegas. It's far from the strip and a bit gross and very dated. I constantly felt like I needed to wash my hands.
0;This review is based on the fact I was a guest here and live locally. I had to be at work early the next morning and was late due to the parking structure guy. \nUpon arriving at check in I asked for my white ticket to get validated. He gave me a parking pass and said I didnt need the white one. Sweet. \n\nTurns out I DID need that ticket and it caused me to be late. \nThe parking guy gave me 2 options: sit and wait for security to come and id have to prove that its my car (it wasnt...it was clearly a work truck)  or go back to the room where the white ticket was left. I tried waiting but 5 minutes seems like forever when you know youll be late by the time they figure out that you are legit. \nAfter having to re-park, go downstairs, then the elevator back up to the room then back down and out to the garagr.....uggh....yeah. I was late. \n\nNeedless to say, I probably wont stay here again.
3;"NOW I GET IT!!!! \""RAw SUSHI!\""\n\nVery clever.\n\nI was in Vegas for tamales in December (Yes, just for tamales. Really.) and tried to find Ra for a mid evening snack, but couldn't. Dunno where it went. Anyhow, last time I was there it was good stuff. It's not the best in Vegas, but it was certainly one of the simplest experiences I had there. It isn't worth cabbing to the Luxor for, but once you're there and you've washed down too many three-foot ra-aritas upstairs, come slide some RAw fish down."
2;My sister was visiting so i decided to take her to Loopy Lornas for a change away from the cafe bars and we opted for the afternoon tea as nothing else on the menu really stood out. The afternoon tea was very nice but very expensive at \u00a314.95 per person and that was for standard tea \u00a316.95 for speciality tea. The service wasn't great they forgot to give us plates for the food and I seemed to have to repeat about 3 times to the waitress what our order was and tehn with that they brought my niece two hot chocolates rather than one! I have to agree with previous reviews that the cakes i have tasted in the past have seemed to be quite dry although the cupcakes are lovely and all the little sweet treats we had in the afternoon tea were nice.\n\nI have to also agree that when ever i'm in there does seem to be alot of tables with young children but i think the reason for that is that it is the largest cafe/tearoom in Bruntsfield/ Morningside and they do gear there menus to little kids that other cafes don't.
0;My family and I came across this restaurant by accident. We came in with positive attitudes and hoped for a satisfying experience. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for what we encountered. It took about forty five minutes for us to receive our food in this empty restaurant, but I hoped the food would be worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken was smothered in sauce - being hardly edible. The grilled lemon chicken that two other family members ordered needed to be returned due to it being cold. The grilled pork was satisyingly warm in temperature, but nothing special. The server never officially took our drink order, and never came back to refill our water. This was definitely not a very pleasant experience.
1;This is an OK place to go and hang out with some friends after work and maybe get some chips and salsa. I went there for dinner and it's basically what you'd expect from a chain Mexican restaurant. I was not impressed. There are much better places to go if you are in the mood for Mexican food.
0;I would like give a positive review. So, initially I will. There are a couple of service writers I enjoy very much. They are Kangaroo Bob and the gentleman sitting next him. His name escapes me at the moment, but he's the good looking mate, who is also very charismatic. The opposite of Bob. I would also like to recommend Ryan Bostein, in sales. Ryan is competent and knows Mini's well. If you have to buy a Mini in Las Vegas, I recommend Ryan. He can be reached at 702-985-8650. \n\nNow, the negative portion of this review. The service manager is an idiot. He lies, he is incompetent, and he insulted my girlfriend and me. And he isn't very keen with arithmetic. He thinks he knows everything. I don't believe that to be the case. In fact, I know at least a dozen people who share my opinion.\n\nBrandon Busse, the general manager of Mini Las Vegas, hasn't been much help either. I have called him four (4) times in the last month. He has called me once. And I stopped in to see him. Nothing. \n\nMy Mini will never be serviced at Las Vegas Mini again. You are such a bitter disappointment.
1;not a fan.  the food was meh, the service was horrible.  went there for lunch today with a small group, ordered an appetizer for all to share and each ordered an individual dish.  i also ordered an ice tea - they were out.  i believe this has to be a first for a thai place.  \n\none of our dishes came out about 15 minutes of waiting, still no appetizer.  finally after about  30-40 minutes the appetizer came out followed by the other two dishes spaced out about 5 minutes apart.  ???  lunch took  about 1 1/2 hours and the taste wasn't worth the time it would take at panda.  f this place.  don't go.
4;spend some good amount of time at this place, and very friendly people, and the customer service is very good.
0;"I had a reservation in which my insurance company was paying for. I talked to \""John\"" on the phone and had everything set up and asked ahead of time if I could pay cash and I was told it was not a problem. I take a Taxi to their location (was in an accident) and \""John\"" was the one I talked to and became the most difficult person to deal with that I've ever talked to. Wouldn't take cash and wouldn't allow me to use a card that was in someone else's name. They also wouldn't pick us up from 2 miles away because they were apparently too busy.. but when we got there they were anything but busy. I understand companies have policies but give me a break! He literally lied to our face and was a complete dick doing so."
1;"Clever in charging a lot of underwhelming flavors is what I got from my visit.  The crowd is downtown hippsters, who want to be seen. The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian \""inspired\"" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was \""good\""  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet."
0;Worst place ever in charlotte. I order the sweet 18 roll, and 4 others... They were all not good. For some reason it was hard to finish the food, maybe it was the overload of msg in their sauces. I don't mind msg in food but when a restaurant puts too much in it gets hard to eat. The couple sitting near us had a really pissed look on their face, had three bites, paid and left. I should have taken a picture as proof but I was too angry with the food to think straight.
3;I love this cute, quaint restaurant. You can even catch belly dancing here on the early weekend nights! The food is amazing. Be sure to try the thick hummus and the Shawarma. \n\nEven the drinks are unique. I had one of the best glasses of lemonade (it was extremely fresh tasting and it had a pleasant aroma) and was unlike anything other lemonade I've ever sipped.\n\nThere's also a market inside the restaurant where you can pick up a pound of Feta.
1;We were greeted at the door by the owner/hostess who told us her mother was the chef.  We order water and were surprised to have bottleed water served. I was hesitant to order fish because the restaurant was virtually empty at 7:15PM on this Friady night so I opted for the masitas de Puerco that owner recommended.   The only problem was the kitchen was pork free this evening. My next order was pollo asada al ajillo - chicken seasoned and marinated in garlic.  It turned out to be a grilled leg quarter, but I could not discern any garlic or other seasonings.  My wife's pechuga de pollo a la plancha - grilled chicken breast topped with grilled onions was another yawner. Our entrees included rice and fried plantains. We concluded the meal with a very dense flan that was more than decent.  On our bill was a charge for for bottled water that we never requested, but I have since learned this is SOP for this restaurant.
1;My husband decided to surprise me with flowers the day before Valentine's Day, so he stopped at McDonald on the way home from the office.  The flower arrangement itself was beautiful, however within two days the flowers started to die.  We contacted the shop and they told us we would need to bring the flowers back in order to replace them (there was no guarantee that they would be replaced)\n\nIn the past we have ordered flowers from Cactus Flowers, a similar situation came about and without any questions asked Cactus Flowers delivered a new arrangement.  We will not be shopping at McDonald again, instead Cactus has our business for life.
2;I went for a lunch dish in the last minute on a Sat. The head chef made our sandwich which was great, but I think 9 dollars is a bit much. I would come back to try dinner, but I was not real excited about the service. Server was not real informative about a business only being open 8 weeks. I had to ask all the questions about the food. They did not come off real friendly. I love the look and the food, but for the price and snob Scottsdale service... not sure.
4;"Definitely a hidden gem.  Felt like a nice romantic break from the typical Vegas dining scene while keeping up with the quality one expects in Vegas.\n\nStephan took great care of me and probably would have introduced me to the entire staff if given the chance.  Everyone was very friendly and complimented the food quite well.  I initially went in to have some escargots with a glass of wine, but was too tempted to pass up having something more.\n\nThe escargots were delicious.  At first it appeared as if they had over done it with the garlic parsley butter, but it doesn't over power the natural flavor of the escargots at all.  I probably would not share this dish with you, get your own.  As a bonus, I highly reccomend dipping the bread in the leftover parsley butter.  Yum.\n\nThe cheese plate is nice and what you would typically expect from a cheese plate.  The goat cheese is particularly good, but I also love goat cheese.  The candied walnuts were a nice touch.\n\nHad the duck for my main course.  They take a temperature which is nice because I like my duck medium rare.  It was very juicy and tender, which is difficult to do with med-rare duck.  I enjoyed it most out of everything.  The demi-glaze was not overpowering and the turnips and pears came together nicely.\n\nFor dessert I had the almond cake accompanied by the Clarendelle dessert wine.  A pairing I would highly suggest trying.  Great combo and cap to a meal that was supposed to be just an app and some wine.\n\nSpeaking of wine, they have Chateaneuf-du-pape by the glass which is very rare and quite a treat.  They also offer a 3oz pour which is great if you enjoy a shallow glass for swiriling as I do.  It also gives you the ability to have a variety of wines throughout the evening if there wasn't a bottle in their wine shop selection that tickled your fancy.\n\nThe only bad part of the experience was hearing a guest be unnecessarily rude to the manager for no reason when the manager was clearly trying to accommodate him as best she could.  He likely didn't enjoy his experience as much as I did, because he was too busy being a d*ck.\n\nAll in all, a phenomenal place.  You will love it if you aren't a d*ck ;)"
3;After an intense workout, I always get hungry. Zaba's is the perfect place to go after such workout. \n\nZaba's is located in the same lot as LVAC. It has the same concept as Chipotle and Cafe Rio but with much healthier options. They had brown rice before Chipotle started to offer it. They have whole wheat tortillas. They have fish and shrimp. They win. \n\nI always order a salad with chicken. The awesome thing about Zaba's salads are that all of them come with guacamole, free of charge. I keep out the cheese and sour cream (sad face) to avoid totally ruining my workout. They also have toppings that Chipotle or Cafe Rio do not: sweet potatoes, cabbage, different salad dressings. \n\nThe employees there are great. I walked in one time at 8:50 PM when they were about to close at 9 PM. I usually don't do this, but I was really hungry and wanted some Zabas. The employees were really nice about it. I still felt bad though...\n\nPortions aren't too small and they're not too big. I think they're just right. They have a good thing going on in prime location with yummy, fresh food!
4;Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings.  The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Thanksgiving every time.  Great every time.  Really good, really good service, really high quality product.  I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal.  Love this place for a fast meal.
4;Toppings are always fresh. Pizza always good. This is my go-to place to find NY style pizza.
2;Ok so the suite was nice with the jetted tub, etc.  My main issues was with billing and customer service.  Since the billing issue so overshadows the stay I would be careful to stay here again.\n\nLet me explain and you decide:\n\nI left my debit for the deposit on the room...3 days later total was charged on my debit card! What makes this worse is that the room was already paid for so they charged for the room twice.  It took 4 days to get my money back from Caesars.  Learn from my mistake and use a credit card for your deposit card for your room.  Luckily I had the cash to cover it in my account or I would have been broke for 4 days waiting for my refund from here.
0;"woke up late and i really want a quick breakfast and got a really bad service and equally lousy food at nathan's in the las vegas strip food court.  i have to say \""i want 2 waffles\"" 4 times before the bilingual server got my order correctly. my coffee didn't show up on my tray, and the bilingual cashier told me she didn't get the coffee order. in my frustration i  went to starbucks accross the stall to get my fix instead of reordering nathan's coffee. the food is equally bad. the waffle is soggy, the bacon is hard, and the biscuit didn't come with butter or jam. i should have gone to mcdonald's, 2 stalls away for half the price."
0;Tried to like this place and have given it numerous chances. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always had a bad experience. Service is poor, food is not good and overall the place is overpriced for what you get. There are small, basic things that could be changed to help this place out. Tempe could use a great wine bar with dog friendly patio.
3;Love this place.  I don't think I tried anything I didn't like.  My favorite were the bacon wrapped dates, yum!  Service was a tad spotty, some things came out quick, while others did not.  It can get a tad bit noisy, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  I will definitely be back.
4;Best Pedicure in Las Vegas, hands down ( no pun intended). So I very apprehensively  tried this place a few weeks ago. I have extremely high standards in regards to cleanliness, attention to detail. My technician was Bamboo. Bamboo should get an award for turning my hooves into beautiful, smooth, pretty feet. I should probable go the DMV and change my reported height. I would imagine I'm about a 1/4 shorter after my callus removal :-) I love them, and I'm sure you will too!
4;hands down, the best dog park i have been to so far! lots of room, trees, water fountains, good owners, tennis balls galore... what more can a dog want?\n\nnot to mention it has an actual people park as well, where the kids can play. the playground is right outside of the dog park for your kids... \n\n5 stars, awesome bark park...
1;Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop.
0;Sub par food. Waiting time is terrible, didn't get drinks for 30 min and food for like 1 1/2 hours. Just cause there's a party going on doesn't mean you ignore your other customers
2;"Cowbody Ciao has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. Tucked away down a side street in Old Town Scottsdale, for years it has been \""out of sight, out of mind\"" for me, until a few weeks ago when we stumbled across it on a walk through the town. The atmosphere left a little to be desired, but the food was light and delicious! \n\nWe weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to give the famous stetson chopped salad a try. While it was delicious, when most people think chopped salad they picture lettuce. The chopped was the only salad on the menu without a description, and so when a bowl of mainly cous cous arrived, we were surprised. It was delicious, but not what we expected. \n\nFor a unique menu with a southwestern flair, definitely give Cowboy Ciao a try."
4;2 following Meals TO GO were made perfect.  The  Triple Beef Taco is so good that I just told a Visiting Co-Worker that they had to get one before he returned to Michigan.
2;"Oreganos is always good for what it is; family dining and big portions.\n\nSOMEONE PLEASE TURN THE MUSIC DOWN. Please. Please sweet baby Jesus turn it down. Trumpets blaring in my face make conversation impossible here"
1;This place is a last resort if I need something. There never seems to be anyone shopping in there but somehow every time I'm waiting forever on a line. They seem to hire the slowest cashiers that look like they are being tortured just working there. I honestly don't know how this place is still in business. They also do not have a great selection on most items.
1;Delicious dive food but simply overpriced in my opinion. A trio shouldn't cost me $20 and that much attitude.\n\nFood:  7/10\nService:  4/10\nPrice:  3/10\nAtmosphere:  n/a
4;Grandioses Pub zum Versaggen oder Vorgl\u00fchen. Wer meint nur einen Nachmittagsbesuch der Empfehlung wegen zu machen bleibt garantiert kleben oder kommt wieder. Top gelegen. Kneipenstyle ohne schnick schnack. Riesen Bier- und Whiskeyauswahl. Whiskey stilecht in passenden Gl\u00e4sern mit einem Wassertr\u00f6gchen.
4;If I could give Baguette Cafe 4.5 stars I would -- only because I want to them to be open weekends!\n\nThis is truly one of the gems in Las Vegas. I try to make it in here one or twice a month. Oliver and the staff are amazingly warm and familial. And the food is fantastic. It's clear there is a great deal of care taken into the creation of each dish. The balance of ingredients is spot on. Oh, and the bread... oh my god, the bread. I keep meaning to ask if they sell it. It's perfection. \n\nI lived in France for 3 months when I was in college, and this is truly the only place I've been to since that really reminds me of the food and atmosphere there.
0;Complete rip off artists! I reserved a 1 bedroom jr Penthouse suite facing the strip with a patio on the 30th floor for $148.00 a night. When I arrived I was given a studio on the 30th floor facing the strip with NO patio. I called Blue Chip and spoke to Krystal. Not only was she rude and unprofessional she hung up on mean because she said I was mad. I called back and she told me that's what I reserved and if I wanted a 1 bedroom it would be $50.00 more a night. After fighting with her about this for 30 minutes I was left with no choice but to pay the extra. No refunds. She gave me a filthy, dirty 1 bedroom on the 17th floor facing the pool, not the strip. We heard Techno music all day from the pool. \nI could have stayed in a brand new clean room at The Cosmopolitan for $200.00 more. \nI talked to people at the front desk and they said they get complaints from this co. all the time. After I got home I noticed I was charged an additional charge. I have to fight to get this charge back.\nStay away from this company if you don't want to get ripped off like I did.
3;"We had a restaurant.com certificate so we decided to take our friend here for his birthday before the Counting Crows concert at Mandalay Bay beach. I made a reservation but I think it was kind of slow. When we walked up, it looked completely crazy but I think a big party was waiting to be sat. \n\nOur server was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. We ordered calamari and an 18\"" ham and pineapple pizza. Everything was really yum. The ONLY complaint I have is that the pizza could've used a bit more cheese. The crust though, omg. I LOVE thin crust pizza but hate how sometimes it gets too soggy or other times it's too crispy like a cracker. This crust was just perfect. It was crispy on the bottom, but soft and chewy on top. If the pizza had more cheese, it would have been AMAZING and deserving of 5 stars. I'd like to go back and next time request extra cheese.\n\nAlso, I got the berry martini and it was TINY and tasted like juice. At $10 a pop, I'd skip the drinks."
0;A lousy hot dog stand with expensive beer.\nFour of us went for lunch Sunday. Server was great, but service was slow because she had tables outside and we were inside. Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad. The spicy one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru. The cook ought to go to Ted's to see how good brats are cooked!\nTried Belgian Fries and they were so overcooked that they were black brown in color and totally crispy.\nDraft beer was almost warm and very expensive. \nFood was very expensive too.\nFood served was cool, probably because it came from a building next door. We were in bar.\nBill for 4 lunches and a couple of beers was over $160.\nMy summary: A BAD HOT DOG STAND, OVERLY EXPENSIVE, WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP...BUT WARM.\nWill never go back.
2;First things first, the food is great.  This is the only Shanghai place in Chinatown (I think) and their food is as close to authentic as Vegas can get.  I especially love their specials menu on the back where if you order one entree, you can get a soup for a little extra charge.  You can get a lot of food for under $10.  \n\nWhen I went here, I ordered these noodles with beans, peanuts, mushrooms, tofu, and meat in a special sauce.  I think they're called Eight Noodles or something, but I love these.  Only Three Village serves these noodles.  Slightly spicy, piping hot, and al dente noodles, this was my favorite dish.  \n\nI ordered it with the hot and sour soup.  Normally, restaurants add too much sour and corn starch so it becomes almost gelatinous.  Here, the texture of the soup was perfect as well as the balance between sour and spicy. \n\nThe worst part of the restaurant, however, is the service.  Never before has the service been such a killer of my good-food feel.  I'm pretty tolerant of bad service, too, but the waitress ignored our table the entire time.  Even worse, there is only one waitress.  When I went, there was only one other table, and she spent 15-20 minutes conversing with the table while I had to get up and service myself.  Worst service.  Ever.
3;If you need ice for a party and live in the west valley this is your place.  Can get 20 pound bags for 2.40.  Which is not bad, considering Costco is about 1.70 a bag.  The best part is I don't have to go all the way to Arrowhead to get ice.  Another interesting note is that the owner told me the 20 pound bags are more like 22 pounds.  \n\nThey also sell reverse osmosis, filtered water at .30 a gallon.  Bring your own jugs or you can buy them here.  \n\nWhat really attracted me to this place you ask??  The Thrifty ice cream sign.  I am a sucker for ice cream and it has been years since I have had Thrifty ice cream.  So in I went and enjoyed a scoop of Rocky Road goodness for $1.80 on a cone. \n\nIf you are looking for ice, filtered water, or some ice cream to cool off in Surprise this could be your next destination.  They are open 7:30 to 7 Monday through Friday and Saturday 10 to 5 I believe.  Sunday is a no go so stock up before.
0;the nail place looks clean, but you can never get any service done.  The owner tells you to make an appt even though they say walk ins are welcome.  When you have an appt with a specific manicurist they still make you wait 1 1/2.  You then decide to not make an appt and get there a few minutes before they actually open, you are told to come back in an 1 1/2.  There are a ton of manicure places in a 1 mile radius that would be thrilled to have the business and do a good job.  My time is too valuable to either sit around waiting with an appt or drive back in the same day and wait.
2;"Just got here, still very busy. Our booth still very wet from being cleaned, both seats and table. When hostess was informed, instead of just wiping it down she began to justify the condition by stating it was clean. Had to wait for drink orders. Not impressed with Svc thus far. Martini seemed to lack alcohol & it's $10. Had to wait fairly long for food. When it arrived it was hot and very tasty. Kudos for flavor except for sauteed spinach; garlic overload. My burger while very good was overdone. Our server who was very pleasant comped the burger when he discovered it was not as I ordered. He did so without me requesting it. I will go back, but service really needs to consider the customer more."
4;Update on my recent experience, I went back in for my skinny boost which I'm in love with, but this time I signed up for the health coach. This is my first time ever having a consultant to talk to about my weight loss journey.. but I feel so comfortable with the people who work there and I look forward to going in every month! :-)
4;Dave is simply wonderful. He will make sure that you are well informed and he will keep the costs of repairs affordable. you will be in good hands.
0;LIARS!!!! Sign said open til 1 am and it was 12:50 and they were still there! My taco bell satisfaction was ripped from me. I thought this was America, taking away my Taco Bell privileges and sh*t. Good thing jack in the box is always here for us and they are nice!!!!!!
2;"The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.\n\nThe menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.\n\nThe Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.\n\nThe fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs. But if you want to check out a really cool looking restaurant and eat some other great food definitely check this place out."
0;disgusting food rude workers. signs everywhere to not take more food than you can eat/not to wase food to prevent rise in cost....if food was edible i would eat it.  $28 for me n hubby wasted.
1;I have been twice now.  Both times I went in looking for good wings.  Both times I walked out disappointed. \n\nI had the boneless both times.  The chicken is lost in the heavy breading.  Very dry. \n\nI do like their options for various flavors.  The Mango Habanero is excellent.  Also like that they offer a dry season. \n\nBut if I am looking for good wings or boneless in this case, there are some other places I will look first. \n\nGreat for football viewing.  Also they offer UFC fights.  Also nice selections of beer.
1;We made a special request, so maybe we put them out of their element, but I didn't particularly like the dish we got. \n\nMy girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to have our own dish so we decided to share one. She's vegetarian so we asked for the Beef Fried Rice with the beef on the side. The rice was good but the beef mostly tasteless. Didn't taste seasoned at all. I wonder if that has anything to do with our special request? Or if they rely solely on the rice providing the flavor? I would hope that they also season their meat too.\n\nEh, OK place.
2;"I've been here a few times, and service hasn't been bad. When we actually got service today, it wasn't bad either. That's why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1. In the first 10 minutes we were there today, 3 servers walked right past us, including after we got the attention of one girl. They appeared to be socializing with another table. Our server was very attentive, as I said. She did a great job. The highlight of our trip was when one of the hostesses walked past out table yelling, \""Someone's gotta pee! Someone's gotta pee!\"" over and over again. I guess in my profession that's something one keeps to oneself."
0;I would not rent from them. They are thieves. The only reason I'm giving them one star is because they upgraded our car at no addition cost because the class car we rented was not available. We never take the optional insurance. We are covered by other means. We were asked if we wanted the insurance and clearly said, NO. when we returned the car we were charged for insurance. We were extremely exhausted and had been waiting a long time in line for the car. By the time we got all the paperwork we just signed where we were told to without double checking everything. The agent clearly took advantage of our exhaustion and robbed us of $150 for insurance that we refused but he checked yes. Go with another option if it costs you a couple extra dollars.
2;I only come here for xiao long bao which is the soup dumplings, but I also usually get the pan friend shanghai dumplings and beef roll. Rarely do I venture outside of that here. \n\nThe foods good, I haven't found a place with better xiao long baos in Vegas, however the service is alright and some times you'll get someone who barely speaks or understands English. It hasn't detoured me yet though.
1;All I have to say is... You had a nice run but it's time to quite.  I go about once a year and each year they go down hill a little more.  I don't think I'll go back.
1;If this place's prices were 20% less, I would give it 3 or possibly 4 stars.  This review is probably a 2.5, not fully a 2, but I can't go to a 3.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good, but not great meal.  The problem is that it's priced like it's Delmonico, Cut or Carnevino.  And, it ain't those places.  My wife had the special, which was crab stuffed lobster.  The lobster had a strong fishy odor, which indicated to us the lobster was not totally fresh.  Perhaps this was why it was used for the stuffed lobster rather than being steamed and served whole.  She had the filet, which was fine, but not overwhelming and certainly not worth the cost.  I had the ribeye, which again was fine.  Certainly better than your neighborhood Outback, but not worth anywhere near what they charged.  \n\nService was adequate.  The wine list was average I would say, probably decent for downtown.  If you plan on spending this much on a meal, I would recommend Prime, Brand, etc.....
1;Flying Delta out of Phoenix today.  The desk clerk might have been the most annoying person I've come across all month.  Literally every 4 minutes he got on the overhead with an annoying anecdote about how people need to check their carry on bags. Just make people check them if the plane is full. I don't need to hear about how Santa wants me to be on the nice list. Just get these people on the damn plane.  Boarding has been going on for 30 min on this not very busy airplane!   Ugh!
3;Amina has moved over to Snapdragon, so that's the spot.  Losing a star because a star left....
0;This hospital was appalling. My visit started with admitting, where they misplaced my paperwork and I had to call my doctor to tell them the problem, who in turn, got the supervisor in admitting to all of a sudden locate the orders that had been faxed to them twice.  Really??  Upon arrival for the surgery, my admission was slowed down by lack of information because for some reason, two days later, my per-op information was not completely entered into the system. Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring, impatient and rude. I was left with no pain control for 24 hours before my surgeons assistant came and took care of it herself. Every time I needed assistance, I had to call for a nurse repeatedly, only to get results when I became loud out of pain and frustration. Every person there during my visit was incompetent, rude, obviously hated their jobs, uncaring, in compassionate, and god forbid if it was time for a shift change. Never, in my life, will I ever, ever, EVER recommend this cold, heartless, thoughtless, rude, uncaring, in compassionate so called hospital/staff.  They should all be put in front of the board and the building should be shut down. I will refuse to even die there. I'd chose the gutter first, the rats would be of more assistance and compassion than Valley Hospital in Las Vegas.
0;This was the most unprofessional company that my husband and I have ever dealt with any where.  We currently live in New Jersey and are purchasing a home in Charlotte.  We decided to use Screenmobile to install security screens and doors.  We made it clear that we would be flying in for the sole purpose of getting an estimate and meeting with the owner.  \n\nWell the owner made the meeting and made some good suggestions but failed to follow through.  It has been three weeks and we have not received an estimate or a phone call explaining the delay.  I have called twice to find out the reason for the delay and when we can expect installation but each time the owner, David isn't there and he never returns my calls.  This company has horrible customer service and clearly doesn't want our business.  My husband and I have moved on to a different company, DB Doors.  They returned our call immediately and gave us an estimate within a few hours.  I would not use Screenmobile.\n\nI must say however that Debbie at Screenmobile is awesome.  She tried as best she could to help us and emailed David several times but she can only do so much sense the lazy person is her boss.
4;We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else.
2;"On the way over I was arguing with my wife on the phone.  When I got there I was all pumped up.  I ordered the salad bar.  \n\nMy friend ordered a tuna sandwich.  We both had water.\n\nI made a pretty basic salad: iceberg, greens and baby spinach; red onion; olives; pumpernickel croutons; other things and balsamic vinagrette.  Those little ginger muffins they have are siq.  I had a bunch of them.\n\nI spilled my guts to my homie about my situation.  He listened pretty well.  I felt a little better afterward and a little awkard.  \n\nLunch was pretty good though."
4;Food is amazing always! Never frozen anything, so everything is fresh!!! Great deals, great food, and great people! Yes sometimes they forgot a few things, but were very fast in rectifying the situation! I have eaten here since they have opened, and I will keep eating their delicious food!!! Love this place!!!
4;I love this zoo and aquarium!
2;"Taco Tuesday was not made for me...they should try real tacos before naming theirs tacos. The deep fried cheesecake burrito is a mix of bland flavours, that won't satisfy your search for an original dessert.\n\nAnyway, the good deal is the beer price and their patio. Tuesdays are also empty, so you can even get good attention. The unexpected? they have board games and even WII. \""Still looking real tacos in Phx area\""."
0;The name says everything. The sashimi portion are small and expensive. Not a fan of all u can eat sushi bars. Service for get it. Pass on this bomb.
1;If the food is marginal you would at least expect the service to be exceptional. It isn't. \n\nI'll put up with decent service for great food or decent food for great service, but when you don't get either one what's the point in going?
4;hands down right now...  My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The room is fabulous.  Very sleek.  If you sit at the counter, you can view the chefs at work in the kitchen.  \n\nI have been twice.  The first time i had the short summer tasting menu - but it was a tad rushed because i had a flight to catch. \n\nThe second time, I went with 6 of my friends and we all had the longer tasting menu - i think it was called L'Exploration or something.  and we did a wine pairing.  the somelier can pick and choose a wine pairing based on your price point.  it was amazing.  Every dish was tasty.   \n\nIts been a while but my highlights were langoustine carpaccio, stuffed quail, and his extreme buttery mashed potatoes that come in a mini creuset.  There are so many more...  I highly recommend a tasting menu!  :D
2;hmmm i have rather mixed feelings about this place.  i love the brass monkey in leith!  it's a fabulous bar that is literally a five minute walk from my flat and has an awesome pub quiz on monday nights.  but the cellar monkey, which is the newest offer from the brass monkey people left me wanting for something more....\n\nsaturday night, i went along with a group of friends for some birthday drinks.  when we arrived the bar was empty save two people that were meeting us there.  this was saturday night at 8pm.... in a bar that is surrounded by student flats and has comfy sofas to sit on while having a drink.  i found this emptiness odd, given the area and the night and felt that the bar lacked an atmosphere.  more people did eventually come in, but save for the group of guys that sat in the corner the rest were there for the birthday drinks.  so either this bar isn't overly popular (which would be sad) or people don't really know about it.\n\nit would make me sad if this bar wasn't popular as it's such a lovely cosy wee spot that should be ideal for those students or non students living nearby.  there was loads of seating, most of it in big sofas or comfy arm chairs that gave the bar a bit of a living sort of vibe.  also plently of drinks on offer at a reasonable price with friendly bar staff.  so maybe this place is still bedding in as it's not long since it opened.  i'm hoping this is the case as the bar has great potential and it would be terribly sad to see it close due to lack of customers!
1;Not very funny .He is a Nice guy but Not funny  hes better than Gordy Brown ..Gordy Brown a time share pitch im sure is better .....
4;I've been bringing my automobiles to these guys for three years now. They've never failed to address all my problems. They are friendly to women and don't take advantage. There work is dependable and their prices are unbeatable. If there is a problem with a part they will physically show you the issue and explain how they will fix it. You will not find better mechanics in Las Vegas or Henderson! Totally trustworthy. Thanks Dynamic Auto!
4;"With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown Vegas, it's with much excitement that we ventured our way to it's newest arrival, Eat.\n\nFrom what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.\n\nAs the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....\n\nAnd as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...\n\nWe're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...\n\nWe were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!\n\nAnd we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!\n\nWell, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!\n\nI came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!\n\nI relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...\n\nBy our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.\n\nWe also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....\n\nAnd as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!\n\n\nRatings (Out of FiveStars)\nFood:           5\nService:       5\nAmbience:   5\n\nPERFECT SCORE!!!"
1;Oh, Athenian Express. You were so promising, alluring, and tempting when I walked in the door and yet, so disappointing.\n\nThe bad:\n- Awful gyro meat. This tastes like the gyro meat at Crave sandwiches, which we all know isn't real gyro meat. \n- THREE slices of gyro meat. THREE. I took a picture to prove that it literally only came with three slices. Whichever reviewer said that their sandwiches were bigger than a Kronos lied and lied mercilessly. Seriously, who gives three slices of meat?\n- The sauce was mediocre. It's homemade, but that doesn't mean it has to be mediocre. \n- Fries aren't anything special. They taste like fries that come in a bag, no special seasoning or anything. \n- Cubs fans. Enough said. \n\nThe good:\n- I ordered fries, which I got, but they also gave me fruit. I don't know why, but this saved the review from being one star because the fruit salad had mango AND orange in addition to melons and strawberries.\n- Fast service. Damn fast. Maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat.\n\nOverall:\nI was so excited to go here because I only get gyros on a special occasion. Well hot damn, I won't go back. I'm going to stick to George's Famous Gyros on McKellips in Tempe where not only are they not Cubs fans but they use real gyro meat.
0;"I took my daughter here for her 21st birthday and what a mistake I made!!! We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.\n\nI stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. \n\nThis tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio \""All Suites\"" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other \""Strip\"" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there \""Ghetto\"" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. \n\nSince my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it. \n\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!!"
0;Stopped in for a post Pirate game beer last night. I ordered an IPA and sat down at the bar. I couldn't wait to leave as the sour smell of stale beer and who knows  what wafted from the tap drains. Call bar rescue! \nThe annoying lady with her cell phone pugged in at the bar didn't help my my experience either.
2;I know, it's hard to believe...this was my first time EVER eating at a IHOP. And it was okay. \n\nThe Good: \nI thought the decor was really cute, they have these walls with windows that kind of give it a cottage feel (i feel weird saying that for an IHOP...But its true) \nI waiter JESUS was super nice, and thanked us for our order and coming in. I thought that was special because most restaurants don't thank you for your $$.\nthe french toast was SIGNIFICANTLY better than the blueberry pancakes. the syrup was overpowering on the pancakes\n\nThe bad: \nthe meal is 9.99 compared to the exact same meal at dennys costing 3.99\nthe hashbrowns were cold and hard. \n\nNext time Ill go to denny's since neither place is fancy, might as well pay less.
1;"Stopped here on Sunday night with a friend.  I hadn't been to Uno's in more than 15 years.\n\nWe ordered 2 brews and a Numero Uno pizza - classic deep dish with tomatoes, peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni.  Server was friendly and professional - he did a great job of checking in on us throughout the meal.\n\nThe problem was with our pizza - it was ice cold in spots.  My dining pal explained that the pizzas are all kept frozen and reheated to order.  Really?  But it made sense, given the ice crystals that I could still see between the crust and the toppings...\n\nOur server took the pizza back to be \""refired\"" and returned about 10 minutes later.  It still wasn't piping hot, but it was better.\n\nThe pizza was good, but the frozen spots were a bit troubling.  Price was on the high side as well - $19 for a deep dish that barely fed 2 people; brews were more spendy than other places.\n\nInterior is nice, but the bar is quite small.  I'd imagine it would be an uncomfortable place if you were waiting for a table during a busy night."
2;My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.\n\nWe both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. \n\nThe pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. \n\nBut let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!
2;"We returned after several months and we're really surprised how slow they were for a Saturday.  The menu has changed and they didn't have the Poblano Queso we used to order so that was a huge disappointment. Also my husband had to order at least 3 different beers because they had just \""ran out\""."
1;This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time.
2;"Ok uhm Did they just get Coyote Ugly? Because when they first opened, they were semi cute. It was a big publicity stunt open audition in Downtown. Unfortunately this place isn't the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. Yea I'm pretty sure the NYC one is closed. This one....LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. Plus there's gaming. Plus they don't market correctly. Yea so this is kinda a biker bar that plays a lot of rockabilly and country. \nThe bartenders do tell you to go \""f*ck yourself\"" if you're a guy....They're very prowomen - Most of the yelling through the megaphone sounds like an angry McDonald's worker. I just want a drink...Ok so this one time I ordered 2 drinks. The bartender messed it up and she threw the glass. Yea she was pretty drunk. Couldn't handle her own. She doesn't work there anymore. She was kinda cute in her drunk way. I mean I know if she passed out, she'd let me hit it. Yea....Anyway it's an \""experience\"". It's not the busiest bar. But I think they need to do a few changes before I can even rate this bar right."
1;I had intended to visit the French restaurant next door, but it was completely packed on a Friday night so I went up the stairs to this Indian restaurant instead.  Wasn't very busy, but there were two large groups having a good time (both had wine, so they brought their own as this is a BYOB place).  \n\nOrdered the combination dinner with dal soup, the soup was rather bland compared to what I've had elsewhere.  Next were some meat rolls with a small salad, and they were either dried out or overcooked, again somewhat bland.  For the main course, the chicken curry was spicy, but not in a pleasant way, just a slow after burn from the long red peppers.  The vegetables looked overcooked, but tasted ok.  The rice pudding for dessert was good, at least.  \n\nEven though i only had water with the meal, this was one of the most expensive dinners during my visit to Montreal.  If you're traveling on to Toronto, save it for the lunch buffet at Dhaba, you won't regret it!  Otherwise, Indian food in Montreal doesn't seem to be that great so read plenty of reviews and choose wisely...
1;Didn't open on time. The guys just stood there and looked at me as they smoked. Not cool IMO. They finally opened at 8:15 (15 minutes after they were supposed to). Fail.
1;What the crack. No.\n\nFood was not only unmemorable, but ridiculously priced and not delicious at all.\n\nI am not sure why we wasted our money and time here when there are so many better Las Vegan restaurants here.\n\nBe gone!
0;Bartender charged me $29 for a Bellini that was just champange!! rip off city, don't stop here.
0;Sad clientele at this place.  Played a few slots and didn't stay too long, this place is a big dive.  I suppose it's worth it to see it since it's a historic casino but honestly, I wouldn't recommend even checking it out.  It's the sort of place that you probably don't want to be around come sundown.  There's plenty to do at Fremont St. Experience, just stick with there.  The El Cortez is not for the faint of heart!
0;Just terrible - \n\nWe purchased a bed for our son with a next day delivery between 8AM and 3PM. After waiting all day, we were called at 3:30PM with notification that they were an hour away, which didn't work for us since we had plans. \nThey informed us they would come the next day, and showed up, but with the wrong piece (They delivered parts for a twin bed, when we purchased a full bed) and after speaking to a very defensive-sounding customer service agent, were told they would deliver the correct piece the next day and that we would need to speak to a manager to get any kind of refund on our delivery fee. \nWe left a voicemail with a manager and never got a call back. \nThe next day the delivery man came, this time again with the wrong piece. The customer service agent said that while they apologized for all the errors on their side, they would only reimburse half of our delivery fee and that they would deliver the correct piece in two more days (5 days after the promised delivery date) and it's at this point that I informed them that I would not accept this and that I wanted them to return the product. The delivery man for some reason got mad at me and rushed back into the house to grab the other pieces of furniture that was already delivered the night before and off they went. He informed me that they would refund my money until all of the pieces were returned back to the warehouse so now my fingers are crossed that this truly happens. I have never had such a poor experience with a furniture company and will not shop here again. \n\nSuch a shame - my wife and I were big fans of the furniture displayed here and the prices too. But if you don't trust a company to deliver the product correctly, there is no way we can shop there again.
2;"Located in the shadow of the Stratosphere this place has good ol Vegas-style pizza-Cheap & Fast!\n\n!We ordered the FAMILY DINNER special w/1-2topping 18\""pizza,spaghetti,lasagna,salad and garlic bread plus a @L of Coke=$30!! Delivered in 30 minutes.\n\nPizza was good,lasagna too but spaghetti was nothing specialsalad was warm from being delivered in the same bag & the garlic bread wasnt toasted.\n\nStill a good value & pizza for breakfast the next day!!!"
2;"pros:\n-got in for free\n-decent music\n-car crash like go go dancers (can't look away)\n-sexy decor\n\ncons:\n-crowded like no other.  there was barely room to move.\n-the only place to sit were these benches where a candle fell on my friends head\n-nearly impossible to get drinks\n-tiny, tiny, tiny dance floor\n-foam is gross\n-weird layout\n\nI don't know if I would go again, but getting in for free saved this place.  That and they played \""Sweet Caroline.\"""
2;Was told  by promotors that Thursday Haze plays hip hop.. negative! Expect any Vegas club experience.. Super big.. super crowded!\n\nSean Paul performed that night so that was really cool minus the part that I felt like the crowd didn't even know his old songs. Really annoyed me lol
4;"My husband and I moved to Charlotte about 9 months ago from Los Angeles.  We are both native Spanish-speaking Latinos and grew up in households where eating traditional Mexican foods as well as Central American foods was part of our daily lives (I'm from Nicaragua and my husband is Mexican-Cuban).... \n\nComing to Charlotte, we knew that it would be difficult to find food that even comes close to the awesome-ness of LA's Mexican-food scene.  We are truly foodies when it comes to Mexican and Latino cuisine.... \n\nWell, Three Amigos is as close as  you're going to get to the BEST Mexican cuisine in Charlotte.  All the food is made from scratch and they serve traditional Mexican fare: tacos in warm corn tortillas, topped with onions and cilantro; Enchiladas made from scratch with authentic sauces.... If you eat meat, their Al Pastor is pork marinated in spices over 24-hours and is phenomenal... The Gorditas are hand-made: thick, hand-made corn tortillas stuffed with goodness; Plus, you can tell everything by the rice and beans (the staple of any mexican dish or latino dish)... Their mexican rice is just like my father-in-law used to make and refried pinto beans that are fresh, not from a can!\n\nYou cannot get Mole anywhere else in Charlotte that is authentic - this is the only place I have found that makes an amazing mole....  Plus, if you've got little ones, they are a family-friendly spot too... Our two-year old loves it here!  The service is great - everyone is friendly and attentive.... you may have to wait a little bit for your food but that's because it's actually home-made and not \""reheated\"" from a can.... Do yourself a favor, and head over there for some delicious food!"
3;This store  has everything you need to be crafty. Sometimes it is hard to find what you are looking for or someone to help you find it. When you do find someone to help you though, they are great. The staff is knowledgable and friendly, there just needs to be more of them!
4;Amazing sushi. My family (extended included) have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed. The School Bus roll and the Vegas roll are our favorites. The teppanyaki is always delicious as well. The atmosphere is so fun and is great for casual dining or for a special event. The staff is always very friendly and seem to remember us. Always a great time and always leave satisfied.
4;"Back to wearing glasses after 11 years and all I have to say is \""Thank You\"" to Central Phoenix Eye Care. You made the experience the best possible. And Dr. Stephanie Mastores is incredible. I can see clearly now and am looking fashionable as well. This is the only optometrist I will ever recommend. Thanks again and Go Buckeyes!!"
3;Great tasting steakburgers and delicious frozen custard...My fav is Hawaian Delight Sundae or Concrete (blended)
1;"Well.\n\nI am unsure if this place has good prices for their products as I was picking up a gift card for my neice, and I have to say, some of their \""standard\"" prices seemed higher than other places.\n\nI toured the hair products for men, and prices were at least 20-25% higher than all other places I have seen and from where I purchased.\n\nIs this a good place?? not too sure - as it is catered to women, but I sure do hope my neice utilizes the gift card on a sale item.  Guess that is the only way you get your money's worth."
4;I was a little nervous because I just moved out here from CA and didn't have a hairstylist. I found The Root on Yelp and I loved it. It lived up to its high rating. My hair looks amazing and the prices were reasonable. I am a customer for good!
4;"This stuff is as close as it comes to what you find in Belgium. For your first time, I would recommend getting it plain to taste all the sugary flavors. My favorite is the 'Antwerp\"" with the Speculoos ice cream! Gaaaah, I've already been there three times, it's a wonderful addiction! The bossman was super cool, laid back and throughly answered my questions while carrying casual conversation with me.\n\nTheir interior is SOOOOOO much better than what Dozen's made it out to be. Their menu board is an adorable train station-like departure/arrival board. They also have a cute vintage clock and an awesome divided map of Belgian. I love the stools and wall tables, nice and quaint. This place is meant to pick up a waffle, mingle for a little bit, then be on your way. It is NOT A RESTAURANT, so don't expect there to be multiple tables and lots of space to your leisure. Perhaps they will have outdoor seating when the temperatures rise, but you have to pay the city that. It has a similar feel to La Gourmandine bakery where in France they take their viennoiseries and leave. \n\nSo so pleased that this popped up in Squirrel Hill. Don't think it's kosher, though."
1;"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I give it two stars because everyone I've encountered on the staff is super nice.\nBut the food is not good. We got they gyros for lunch once and there were pretty terrible. The meat came in giant, hard to chew and (size-wise) hard to handle chunks. A few nights ago, we decided to give it another go, mainly because we had a gift certificate. I like that they deliver within a 5-mile radius. However, they do not have this part together at all. We ordered a pasta, greek salad and soup. They forgot the soup. I called them and they apologized and said \""the driver is on his way back.\"" Well he must have gotten lost, because he never showed up and therefore I never got my soup.\nI don't believe this restaurant will last.\nOh and neither my husband or I really enjoyed either the salad or the pasta. It was just ok."
2;The service was excellent. Food was hot. It was just your average chicken restaurant.
3;I've been to Sura several times before, but have never written a review, here it goes...\n\nLocation: Sura has a huge open parking area, most restaurants on Spring Mountain have horrible parking spaces!\n\nAmbiance: The dinning area is spacious,  well kept, and clean. \n\nFood: I love the bulgogi and the short ribs are delicious. I enjoy the fact that it's all you can eat, in addition to it's affordable price.\n\nThe only upside to Sura, is the fact that the waiters don't change the grill until they're asked to do so.
3;"The guys who work here are great.  They are friendly, professional and know their stuff.  Travis, I believe, is the store manager and is very knowledgeable about their merchandise.  I came in to purchase my iphone 6 and my phone arrived more than a week earlier than scheduled.  The transaction was flawless.  They didn't try to \""push\"" me to buy anything else (as others have written).  I'd definitely come back again if I needed to."
1;The Christmas light display was recommended. Lights were extremely disappointing, but the live nativity scene should appeal to the Christian visitors. Very large gift shop. Did not visit the museum so I can not comment on that part of the site.
4;Professional caring staff dedicated to their clients happiness. Dr. Matt came highly recommended to me from several friends and I am now a believer. I am seeking anti-aging therapy and he is a known expert in the field. Also, they are VERY price concious and try to save you money at every turn.
1;This location is by far the worst of them all. I have watched the steadily declining food quality and service since they have opened. Our last experience this last time was the kicker. The waitress was a young girl with very little social skills and really needed help with articulation and volume. She had trouble multitasking and lacked attentiveness. But the other servers picked up the slack. So all was good. We ordered gyro, fatoosh and cilantro hummus. Cilantro hummus is always consistent and good. The gyro not so much. The meat was cooked like bacon: crisp, crumbly and almost considered burnt. It had to be sent back. The return food was decent but had some mystery meat wrapped inside that we will assume for our piece of mind was grill bits.  The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used. And promptly sat another families with children at those tables. Poor quality food, subpar service I can tolerate. Not uncleanliness and poor hygiene. I will visit the other locations.
4;I've been going to Braddah's since the first location opened on rainbow so I was thrilled when I found out one would be opening across the street from my school! I have lunch here at least once a week and I still can't get enough. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I've actually stopped going to chipotle since Braddahs opened because it's just so much better. My favorite thing to get is a steak burrito with seaweed rice, beans, Maui onion salsa, cheese, guac, cilantro, sour cream and some lime mmmmm also the pig is wonderful. The real gem of this place is the coconut bark, no matter how full I am from the burrito I can always eat a whole box of that lovely bark. Seriously try some! Everyone who works here is always super nice and helpful/inviting. So much love for Braddah's!
3;Dinner here last night as part of a party of 11 was a really fun experience & the place is definitely worth your time and money if you're a fan of meat.\n\nHaving seating for only 25 or so overall there's an immediate intimacy between all the diners and the waiting staff, thereby quickly making you feel like a regular even on your first visit. The portion sizes are excellent (a starter may not be the best idea unless you've got a really large appetite) and the service consistently good-humoured and attentive.\n\nGiven the size of the steaks and the various skewered meat dishes it can take a bit of time between ordering and serving but at no time do you feel that this is due to anything other than the need to prepare each dish fresh. There's clearly good reason then for the need to order some group dishes 24 hours in advance.\n\nA very welcome expansion of the dining scene in Edinburgh.
3;I really enjoy this place, I just moved here from Chicago and I always miss some good Korean food.  This place was the first place in Arizona that I've found that has really good korean food!  They have all your traditional dishes and then some Japanese food as well. \n\nThe service there is really good as well, they are always attentive to my needs! \n\nGreat place highly recommended especially if you want to try Korean food!
3;I have been here twice recently and I think this is my new go-to place. There are other sports bar/happy hour places close by, but they are definitely in a league to themselves, and not in a good way. Unlike the d-bag & biker crowd just a block away, Fox and Hound Pub has a friendly crowd with a great staff. I reviewed the new sports bar down the road and remarked how slow the service was there - Fox and the Hound has an attentive staff that has never left me waiting. \n\nI have had the Ranch hand burger and it was excellent. The nachos were something else I have tried - amazing! They have a large selection of beer on tap and craft beers (both domestic and import) that will please any beer drinker. \n\nThe last two times I have visited I have sat at the bar and had Stefani. She is very friendly, attentive, and good to talk to. I have not been disappointed with the service or the selection here. A definite happy hour must stop.
1;"In sixth grade my BFF had her birthday party at the Luxor. Back then this pyramid was the hottest thing on the Strip and thanks to her parents renting us girls a room we had tons of fun jumping on the beds.\n\nSo it was with some nostalgia that I returned here this past weekend after getting a room for $66 on Priceline. Following a long flight from New York (that was delayed over three hours) all I wanted was a shower and a nap. But that was not to be at the Luxor, at least not very quickly. A long line loomed at check-in which I found only after being accosted by employees trying to get me to buy show tickets. Their opening line \""Where are you from?!\"" left me nonplussed.\n\nOnce I finally had a room key in hand I trudged up to my room only to find it either occupied or unclean - possibly both. The bed was unmade and it wasn't clear if someone was still in it. And a half full cocktail sat on the desk.\n\nI quickly closed the door.\n\nI was then treated to another journey downstairs on the impossibly slow elevators to fetch keys to a new room. At long last I made it to my room in the tower. This was apparently an upgrade.\n\nAll told, staying at the Luxor is not an experience I'd like to have again soon. But if you're simply looking for a decently clean place to crash in between trips to da club and/or the slots, it's passable."
3;Absolutely amazing view.  The place is gorgeous and the food was delicious.  Waiters were extremely polite, and they bring you complimentary tasting samples for free--bruschetta and truffles!\n\nHad the grand marnier souffle--heaven.\n\nPrices were high (around $45 for a typical entree that doesn't include any sides), but it was definitely expected for a place like this.
3;"Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!\n\nFR offers 3 rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you won't even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person :).  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your \""fresh\"" air (which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever), you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.\n\nWe ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."
3;Very good restaurant and staff. Low prices and moderate, sensible size portions. Veal chop was great.
2;Not bad, but not the best. A lot of selection, bu not as good as some other burger joints.\n\nCan't wait for LV to get a Counter Burger!
4;Thus is not only a great espresso bar in Montreal it's probably one of the best I've been to ever -- great espresso drinks and the best, fluffiest peach scone I believe is on the planet! A definite stop
3;Selling upper class jewellery of a high quality, Pebbles is nevertheless edgy and contemporary.\n\nMixing traditional styles with new materials and designs, their range of jewellery is eyecatching as well as being elegant. Lending inspiration from a variety of era's, the pieces come together to form a very unusual and striking accessory.\n\nPrices and styles vary according to what you're going for. Some of the designers such as Stagg are expensive, but undoubtedly worth it as the pretty but durable bracelets look like they'd last a lifetime. Some pieces look delicate, while others lean towards statement jewellery.\n\nThey have ranges for men, women and children. Pebbles cater for wedding accessories as much as gifts, but have some delicious rings and necklaces if you're looking to spoil yourself. It's expensive and unfortunately I don't have the cash to burn, but if I did I would set it alight in Pebbles. A wonderful anchor necklace has stolen my heart. I'm sure something will steal yours, too.
1;All the buffets at the various Station buffets are not equal. The food offerings at the Feast Buffet at the Palace Station are no where near as extensive or as well prepared as the buffet at Boulder Station or Sunset Station even though the prices are all the same. So if you are thinking of eating here, instead consider the buffet at one of Station's other properties.
0;Terrible customer service. I'm never going back there. My co-worker & I went there for lunch because we had a coupon. It was a buy one get one coupon. We repeatedly asked the waitress if we could use it & about what we could order. She assured us that we could use it. When it came time for the checks we were informed that we couldn't use the coupon because one of us got the special. There wasn't anything stated on the coupon saying that we couldn't do that. We decided to let that slide b/c they were going to still take half of one of our meals. Then they came back AGAIN & said they couldn't accept the coupon at all. In the end we had to both pay full price. They were extremely rude & not helpful. I guess they don't want us to come back. They obviously don't care about their customers. Plus the sushi wasn't all that great & we had to wait forever.
0;As far as I can tell, no longer there.
4;"Driving on 16th street and what do I see?...a store with obvious charm and vintage fun , I whisper \""  that place is cool \"" , my husband being the smart guy he is says \""Do you want to go ? \""YES\""  I yell .  It was a wonderful moment . \n\nAnd he immediately obliges with a u turn executed with  finesse.  We arrive back at the Bees Knees and I fall in  love  with the murals running on the sides of the building , a giant  bee , a whimisical skull , a graphic mural ... Dee-- Lightful . \n\nConfession: I love vintage clothes , big bold patterns , amazing textures , great details ...it calls to me .... Stores that sell vintage clothes make me happy.  Stores that sell cool old clothes that don't smell like attics are even more wonderful.\n\nThe Bees Knees has impressive racks of womens and mens clothes with funky hipness that screams UNIQUENESS. Prices are very reasonable , wide range of sizes and the qualtiy  is good.  Not everything is old , but the colors and lines are interesting and hip.  They also sell local artist jewelry , purses knick knacks and such.  \n\nI found a beaded full skirt that has amazing textures as well as a bold print floral that is perfect for work.  hubby found a Marvin the Martian shirt that was amazing but the wrong size.\n\nThe Site also host a art space called the Hive.  You never know what might be buzzing back there. ( I aplogize for the obvious.)"
3;A good place to go for tacos and drinks!
2;Great beers on tap, fun snack food and a quick stumble to the orange line...we all know how important that is to me. There was a jazz band playing and because I am getting old, I found that it was a bit too loud and I could only hear the person sitting right beside me, but still, for a Tuesday night, it made for a cool atmosphere. The beer was a tad on the pricey side especially given that it's north of the tracks and the room was nothing special, so that's why they only get 3 stars instead of 4.
3;The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was the second hotel I stayed in on my trip to Las Vegas. Having left the LVH pretty content, we were really just impressed overall! The wait time for check in was considerably less, the rooms between our group (3 rooms) were all great and all had great views. We actually felt spoilt moving from the LVH to Mandalay Bay. \n\nIn our room, my girlfriend and I had our own sink and mirror each on an elongated counter, with a small personal TV in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a separate bath and new, very clean shower cubicle. The room style and facilities were great, no problems and the room service had made it perfect. \n\nUnlike the LVH previously, the corridors didn't hum of smoke (in a no smoking area) and were really well decorated. The casino also didn't wreak of smoke, which quite a few do (coming from the UK, we're not really used to smoking in-doors anymore!). They actually may have sprayed some kind of almond/vanilla like scent/air freshner in the air-con?! Really pleasant.\n\nThe 4 days we stayed at the Mandalay Bay, we really enjoyed ourselves. A really great casino & hotel, classy and host of the great 'Michael Jackson - One' show! Thumbs up all round.
0;It may have been nice when new but its far from it now. If your a smoker this is the place for you. I felt like Id smoked a pack between parking my car and checking in at the front desk. Don't arrive early because they up charge you to check in an hour early.($22) Then of course you need to also pay for the resort fee, another $22. Even if you don't use any of the so called resort. Half the shops are closed or close to it, even one of the Starbucks of the lobby. Dirty, tired the place is past its prime. Even for free I would never step foot inside again. Dump is the 4 letter word that best describes this place.
4;Friendly service and delicious ice cream!
1;Check it...\n\nI generally loathe restaurants attached to a hotel. \n\nWith the exception of Cleo (one of my favorite spots in LA) inside The Redbury (my favorite hotel in LA). \n\nI don't know what the deal is, but they always look like overstock dot com took a dump in the middle of the room (metallic wall art, turquoise arm chairs, ultra modern textiles) and the food is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I guess because it's in a hotel it needs to be bland enough to please everyone? \n\nIn any case, DSG follows in the footsteps of all the other places I've come across where you can slumber and snack... it's just not good. Not only were they out of 3 menu items (one of them being olives... how do you screw up that order?) but the things they did have weren't great. Cheese curds dripping with oil and flattened like little pancakes. Salumi that though I was told was prepared in house felt like chewing flavorless fat. The tuna wontons were fine. The parmesan fries also fine, but nothing about the experience blew any of us away. Service was awkward, less than informative and not very warm. \n\nI apologize to visitor's to Madison who may not make it out of the hotel to dine. This is not a good representation of what our city has to offer.
2;"When my roommate and I walked into 1900 Mexican, I remember being taken aback by the chic design (especially the chandeliers, OMG I covet the chandeliers) and thinking that I hoped the food and the service were as excellent as the decor because if they were then this was going to be a 5 star experience.\n\nIf wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.\n\nLike many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.\n\nThe drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient \""margarita mix\"" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.\n\nThe service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.\n\nI really did want to be able to write a glowing review of 1900 Mexican, but as it turned out, I won't claim to never be returning, but next time I plan on dropping decent money on Mexican, I am likely to try somewhere else."
4;I always go at least twice when I visit my folks in LV.  I stick to the pancakes (duh), but the omlettes aren't too bad either.  The dutch baby (which my mom always orders) does take 20 minutes, so if someone else orders it, you might be in for a bit of a wait.
2;It's a good place,  You certainly can't complain about their salad bar. It's fresh and a great selection.\n\nTheir soups are ok. I typically only find 1 maybe 2 that I think is really good.  I love their muffins and their pizza slices.\n\nService is good too. \n\nI just wish they would change up things on their hot bar more often.
0;"Upon entering Mellow Mushroom the Hostess stand is about 20 - 30 feet away from the door.  Just recently I underwent foot surgery on both feet so I walk with a cane and have those special black shoes they give you until you recover.  The Hostess not only didn't greet me upon entering but proceeded to walk me back to the farthest part of the restaurant.  I stood my ground, pointed to my feet and cane and asked for a booth much closer to walk to.  Next came the waiter who dropped off menu's, no welcome to Mellow Mushroom my name is ----- how are you and what can I get you to drink.  Nothing, no personality at all and before he left I asked for a manager.  I got Andrew who knelt down so we could be face to face and I expressed my view points with the hostess and the waiter whose name I still don't know. He said he would talk to his staff about my concerns.  After we were re-sited I asked for the manager again.  Out came the general manager Blake, I again expressed my view points but he wanted a \""pissing\"" match with me instead.  He wanted to know how many restaurants I had opened, I said I've been in the Hospitality Industry since 1980. I also worked in the customer service department at American Express for many years.  I asked him why the employee's don't wear name tags,  Because it is \""Corporate Policy\"" not to wear name tags as express by the general manager Blake.  Well I like to see the person's name who is serving me.  I asked him why the employee's are allowed to show their tattoo's, again it is \""Corporate Policy\"", if you got them, show them.  Well I don't really want to see someone else's art serving me, although I have tattoo's when working professionally, you won't see them. I have traveled across the United States working and eating in some of the finest restaurants, but I've come to the conclusion Mellow Mushroom is run by some 40 year olds who really don't see the bigger picture.  They hire general manager's like Blake who I may add had been the rudest and most condescending restaurateur I've ever met and I've met a lot.  I guess I'll be getting my pizza someplace else."
0;Good but weird waitresses put labels on ur bottles of orange juice quit smelling my cup to see if it has alcohol in it
4;Moved to the NW last year and I have become a big fan of Roccos. The pizza is great with a full amount of quality toppings on each slice. You can choose pizza by slice or small medium and large. Pizzas are massive so choose wisely unless you want to take some home for later.\n\nThe menu goes beyond pizza and I am looking forward to trying the wide selections of pastas, soups, and breads. Roccos also offers Italian Gellato is also available to complete the meal. Soda, milk or juice for the kids, and a decent selection of beer or wine for mom and dad. Roccos is much more than pizza.\n\nThe dining experience is enjoyable at Roccos as well. A recently expanded dining area with added tables, arcade and small play area for the kids and flat screen TVs add to the family atmosphere.\n\nCustomer service is small town like, something rare in this city. Employees have paid for arcade games for my kids, given us free garlic bread as we waited for the pizza, lets us taste the wine and other warm gestures. They make you want to be generous with your tip!\n\nIn conclusion, after reading this review, you are now informed enough to not choose Domino's!
0;My husband & I have gone here many times. Fun atmosphere. Very good pizza. The staff are snobs. Of all the uptown/dowtown hipster places in the U.S. I've been to eat, I had never dined at a restaurant that fuels itself from bullying the patrons. Consistently. Mean does not = cool. Don't ask for an extra glass of water, and do what the waiter/hostess/manager tells you and you will do just fine. We finally got fed up with the treatment. We will never go back.
0;I went to the suncoast for the $7.11 steak and lobster special. Since it was suppose to be a 5 oz. steak like the website said, I got a tiny piece and when asked for it to be changed both the server and manager said its supposed to be 4 oz and they weren't going to change it. I will not be returning to any Boyd casinos after the way I was treated by the management at the suncoast. I've left 2 comment cards and no response I guess if you don't spend lots of money you don't matter to them.
2;"The place wasn't too packed it looked like your average \""after work\"" crowd...the server was quick and informed us of their happy hour specials. I decided to go with the strawberry margarita; it was pretty good and strong. We decided to order off their \""munchies\"" menu, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari, it was cooked perfectly not too chewy and you could really taste the mix of salt and pepper...  and the mozzarella wedges were your standard fried cheese concoction served with marinara. I also ordered the wings in hot honey sauce which surprisingly were really tasty, they weren't hot at all but the sauce had a great sweet smoky flavor to it. Also some random ordered us a round of Washington apple shots so that made the food taste even better! I will def. be back to try some more food off of the regular menu."
4;Delicious red velvet cupcake with chocolate ganache in the center- exactly what I was craving! Amazing icing and moist cake! Really nice server as well :)
1;This would probably be the low-tier of the steakhouses I've been to. Service was great and all but the steaks weren't that great. Even though dry-age steak that was placed in front of the store wasn't that special.\n\nIt's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks. \n\nBread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread. \n\nPrime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. \n\nFilet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.\n\nDry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.\n\nThe sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. \n\nMushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...\n \nPotato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. \n\nCream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?\n\nRegardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. \n\nI would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me.
0;"This place was just ok. We sat outside and it was very loud but that is not the restaurants fault. We loved the chips and salsa and were looking forward to our meal. I ordered the fish tacos and hubby ordered the short rib enchiladas. I was shocked to see my tacos, they were so small, like an appetizer, the tortillas were smaller than fajita sized tortillas(which is the size I expected). There was a chunk of fish in each taco( there were 3) but the piece of fish on one of the tacos only covered half of the tortilla. So, I take a bite and although presentation was good, these tacos were so bland to me. I tasted a hint of lime but that was about it. Hubby said he would rather eat Taco Bell! He said the taste wasn't horrid, but his dish was way overpriced. Service was horrible, we were  checked on once during our meal by our waitress. We had more interaction from the bus boy!!  The water we were served was barely cold, after filling our glass once, we were given a carafe of room temperature water. I guess their ice maker was broken. We ordered the guacamole, it was good, but way overpriced as well. It came with two oversized chips to which hubby and I both exclaimed \""that's it?!\""  Maybe we both got bad dishes, or the chef was having an off night and forgot to season our food. If you are recovering from the flu and need bland food, I highly recommend this place. :)"
4;A great find.  One of our new favorites, the Santa Fe style food here is some of the best to be found in the valley.  The atmosphere inside is quite charming and our server was attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended.
2;"At first I was so turned off by this place b/c its kind of like the Walmart of Vegas in terms of hotels. But my friend and I were going to see GNR so we figured lets just make it easy and stat at the HRH this time. The last show we saw there was Motley Crue and we stayed at a hotel down the street but getting a cab back at 3:30 in the morning sucks plus we had to leave the next day so this was an easier option. We booked a room in the Hard Rock Tower and it was spacious with a nice set up and very clean. The lights didn't work in the shower and we couldn't hook up our iPhone 5s to the sound system in the room so that was a bummer but we still liked the set up. \n\nThe pools could be nice b/c they are huge and there are different styles - like one with a sandy bottom, waterfalls, and islands to hang out on. But they are so gross b/c there are way too many people there and it's nasty when you think about what is floating around in there (fecal matter comes to mind - ewwwww!). The worst part about that is you can actually see a bunch of nastiness floating in the pool - oil, what looks to be skin, and hair. It really freaks me out but we knew going there the Hard Rock is known for their party atmosphere especially poolside. In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. \n\nMr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate. The eggs were chewy and inedible and they even messed up the English muffin. Seriously how do you do that? Plus it was pricey for shitty food. I was most upset that I wasted valuable stomach space but I didn't eat much. I spent $20 for breakfast and was only able to stomach an eighth of it. Wasteful but it was truly one of the worst meals I ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother eating there.\n\nFu - we had dinner here one night and none of us was impressed. I guess I had high expectations and was very excited for \""Chinese\"" food but it wasn't good. Out of 4 of us, 1 person liked their meal. The staff was friendly though and the meal wasn't horrible it just wasn't what we were hoping for. \n\nCulinary Dropout: This is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have the best staff - so much fun. We loved our servers and went here 3 times in 2 days! Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. \n\nThe Joint: I love this venue b/c it's small and the set up is cool b/c everyone has a good seat plus is you want to go to the bar you can still see the stage. Overall, we had a good experience but I would only stay here again if I was going to a show at the Joint b/c it's too far from the strip which limits my feeding choices :O)"
0;When my girlfriend transferred her service over to our place they told her that we would have the internet that day but when we got home from work we still had no internet and when she called them they told her that now we wouldn't get it until Monday. So now she has to miss work on Monday to make sure that the internet is working. This company is a joke. If she'd had not paid her bill when she did then we would have cancelled the services with them.
3;Definitely a fun place to find as you act like its a scavenger hunt in Vegas, the pizza was as New York as it gets in that part of town.\n\nSome might be turned off by the total lack of seating and long lines but all that is forgotten when you bite into your first slice.
0;"After sushi in China Town, I had the idea to go get foot massages with my boyfriend. Found this place on yelp, and the reviews seemed good. We went there and they had a special going on. 1 hour for \""full body.\"" Sat down and was really sketched out. It was almost creepy. The massage was decent, I've had much better and they were extremely rough. Not rough as in the pressure of the massage but rough as in they were tossing and smacking our limbs around. Not to mention the two massaging us were whispering to each other the ENTIRE time!!! Not relaxing AT ALL!!!!! Honestly, save your damn money. This was a joke. Never again!!! I almost forgot! They hustled me into tipping them more than they deserved! I was just trying to avoid a fight. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!"
1;The first time I went to Miguel's I ordered the fajita plate. That was pretty good. The second I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh. The steak was like the Philly cheese steak you would get from a frozen box and the guacamole was definitely not fresh avocado. The chips and salsa... chips were made fresh as they were still warm and salsa could be freshly made but not sure. I was disappointed the second time. Not sure if I would go back. I can make better Mexican food than this place.
0;I've consistently found things that were either expired, about to expire, or have their expiration date completely erased with acetone to the point where I stopped shopping here. They profit from buying in bulk near-expired products from LA and flipping it here where competition is near zilch. Though it's closer to my home, I'd rather drive twice the distance to Lee Lee's where the turnover rates are higher and their selection more diverse. Nevertheless, this will not deter me from flying Asiana airlines.
1;I was referred to Penny Electric to run a 220 line for my new spa.  The estimate (done by the owner) was reasonable and I liked him a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, things went a bit south when they did the actual install.  I failed my initial inspection with the county because they did not run the ground-wire from each pump to code.  Instead of running it outside the spa and burying it, it was done sloppily and the ground-wire was just run through the cabinet.  When they came out to redo the ground-wire, the electrician busted an irrigation line.  It was obvious to me that the person knew they hit the line because they reburied only that portion of the work (even though the rest of the work was visible because it needed to pass another inspection).\n\nThey did eventually fix the irrigation line issue, but the amount of back and forth was just not worth it.  I would expect the work to be done correctly the first time and not to have the crew come out another two times to fix their mistakes.
4;"Seems I've stumbled upon another salad, soup & sandwich location with wifi. These places will always have a special meaning to me. Ok on with the review,  ( that's 2 thumbs up for the none iphone users). The vibe of this place gives me a relaxed & above average cafe style eatery. They gave a great selection of salads, soups & sandwiches all conveniently laid out in description which helps. There's a $7.99 special which you pick 2 out the 3( soup, salad or sandwich) which isn't bad. \n\nI had the $7.99 special, a turkey & avocado sandwich, a chicken caesar salad  and greedy me had to have the Lobster & red pepper soup. For some reason I can never pass up on lobster soups, this one was delicious, and yes I plan on returning to have this soup again. They also had gumbo on the soup menu which made the \""soup choosing\"" selection hard but lobster wins every time. Something about this place I like, maybe the cleanliness, the brightness or could be the free wifi sign on the door. Whatever it is I plan on returning.. That's for certain. \n\nPS: and you get chocolate strawberries with your meal.. #sweet"
2;Sign up for the ClubVeg coupons. That's the only way this place is a value... Cuz seriously.. WHERE'S THE BEEF? :)  Four stars for the salad bar itself. I've yet to encounter any of the freshness issues.. in fact, everything I've had has been super fresh! Most of their prepared salads are downright tasty, especially the Chicken Won Ton Salad.. a classic! As for the soups, and hot foods, 2 stars, on their best day.  Their soups just aren't that great, and I've tried just about each one... Today the featured soup was lemon orzo and it was absolutely inedible.. Their chicken noodle, is decent, and so is their potato soup, most of the time.. just don't be surprised if you get raw potatoes sometimes. Not uncommon.  They've got a nice selection of carb-tastic breads/pizza type things, which aren't what I'm really there for.. If you're going here to eat healthy, you may as well avoid the hot foods all together. All things considered, the full dinner price, with drink is a bit over $13.00.. The Casino Arizona buffets aren't much more expensive, and neither are the top Asian buffets in the valley. Finally, this place is CRAWLING with some of the most insufferable brats suburbia can offer.
1;"First time at this theater this evening August 20, 2014. Can't say there will be a second. \n\nWe saw the Ninja Turtle movie. \n\nLet's start with the positives. Clean bathroom. Clean theater with decent seats. That's it. \n\nWe bought our tickets online. When I got to the counter to pick them up I asked if my south point card was needed. I didn't know if they reward you for setting movies there-but was hoping. I was looked at like I was stupid and the girl said \""I don't know.\"" Not even \""let me find out.\"" Ugh\n\nThen there was some event going on with a meet and greet. We had no idea where to go or what to do. The concession stand is very confusing and the meet and greet area was blocking the area to our theater hallway. Finally I found a clerk and was told to go over to the other side of the concession stand. But then had to walk through all of the meet and greet people again. When we got our popcorn and drinks the girl scooping the popcorn was kind of rude. \n\nNo refills? No thanks. That right there means we won't be back. I bought a large pop but there was so much salt on the popcorn that my son and I downed the $5 pop before the movie started. I've never been to a theater that doesn't offer refills - even if you have to PAY a small fee for the refill."
0;Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service ..stay away.
3;I've been a big fan of Tomaso's since I was a teenager so was happy to try Tommy V's.  The Italian food here tastes authentic and delicious.  They have a large wine list.  I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it.\nI had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that!\nWe made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.  \nTheir prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.  \nThis would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot.\nGreat Italian and great atmosphere!
1;Let's just say, I was not a fan!  We went here with a group in the middle of the week and we received absolutely terrible service. \n\nIt took forever for us to even get greeted let alone water. Then our food came out at all different times which is always awkward because your food gets cold while you wait for everyone else to be served. \n\nNow let's get to the food. I ordered the mac & cheese and a side salad, it was blah! In fact it tasted like processed cheese not even fresh cheese. One of my coworkers ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, and he sent it back because he said it tasted like jarred Alfredo sauce. A few others ordered sandwiches that came with french fries, and they appeared to be happy. So if you stick with the typical diner style food you'll probably be somewhat satisfied.  This is probably a good spot to take children or people with a not-so sophisticated palate!
2;"Le Mont  isn't the type of place I'd ever choose to go to myself seeing it's fairly expensive and a place where I'd have to cross my legs, sit up straight, and use the right forks- that and the decor reminds me of a dilapidated mansion. But after a delicious pomegranate martini I couldn't care less what kind of restaurant I was in, the cliche view was great and the food to follow even better. Not really \""different\"" enough for my taste... just another fancy restaurant but the service was great and I'd recommend it to someone trying to impress a date."
3;I prefer this place to the Forum shops a million times over.  Huge, huge variety of stores, awesome prices, and it never seems too busy.  I can spend an entire day here, if not longer, shopping and shopping and shopping.\n\nThis place is a nice break from all the casinos, buffets, and hotels on the strip.
2;Wow this deep Pittsburgh Italian in our own Little Italy (Bloomfield) offers up big food and has more menu offers than a Sunday newspaper.  We went on a Monday night which happens to be buffet night- I opted out- they had everything from sausage to wings with a salad bar- a deal at $8 including a drink but I can't think about all u can eat and the food in steaming chafing pans did not look too good.  I opted for the two for $20 deal off the menu- we had eggplant parm it turned out to be a eggplant lasagna but was tasty and large- half went home and chicken picatta- also huge- half went home- dinner included soup, pasta, salad and dessert-   They ruined the angle hair pasta-  ravioli was OK- problem with pasta was overcooked- other than that the rest of the meal was good, enough food for an army and service was pleasant.  The ballgame was on.  The place was packed and it is worth a visit- very Pittsburgh, not a gourmet experience but a far cry from Olive Garden. For dinner and lunch the next day this place is a winner.
3;Have been going to Pappaduex's off and on for awhile now.  Seems like I go through spurts where I wind up there several times in a row then not going back for what seems like a year.  That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.  \nIt is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good.\nThe atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends.
3;China Chili is not only a 4, it is a very solid 4. I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived. \n\nWe ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!\n\nThe House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.\n\nI'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.   \n\nThe Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.\n\nMongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish. \n\nThe Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on. \n\nThis was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day.
4;If you are considering attending the University of Wisconsin as an option for college, you MUST visit the Rathskeller to see what's up.  I remember coming here 10 years ago when I was on my college tour and this place sealed the deal.  It's unlike any other student union on any other campus I've seen.  When you walk in, you feel both instantly cozy and but somehow have plenty of room.  The whole place is all dark wood and murals and arcs of doorways and German decorating.  The cafeteria also makes awesome sandwiches and gigantic chocolate chip cookies.  There's nothing like looking out the window on a snowy day overlooking the lake as you sip cocoa or heading down for a couple beers on open mic night.  This place is one of my favorite places on earth.  You will love it.
3;So far so good ! I personally did not eat it..I bought a Nutella cake for my friend for her bday ...we were in town for tears for fears this past weekend and it was her bday too...hello bday needs cake lolol....I bought a napoleon slice for my mother in la ....I drove it back and was eaten the next day my mother who is critical of everything said it was goood!!! Lolol I said it better be it was pricey. ..my bday girl friend said it was good too. Tho I didn't see her eat it ...would be back :-)
2;We decided to go to Coco's despite the not-so-good reviews. We were greeted by the friendly host as soon as we walked in.  While we just got dessert to go, from what we saw the restaurant looked a little older, but clean.  We ordered a slice of the raspberry swirl cheesecake and a piece of boysenberry pie. The pie was good and the cheesecake was even better. I would definitely go back and try out their dine-in service.
4;Dawn is a great trainer!!, calm fun atmosphere. Always willing to go the extra mile to help with your dog and make everyone in the class feel comfortable. I will recommend them to everyone I meet. I will also be taking my dogs back for further training.
2;This place was nice.   It's small and intimate.  The tickets were cheap but my friend couldn't help but complain about the price of the tiny bag of popcorn he got.  As I said it was nice but some things were hit or miss.  If this place was closer to Glendale I would most likely return.
3;Great service an great food. Barely any wait for our food but when it finally came, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sliders were. Not too wild about the ceviche though but that's all right. I'm easy to please.
1;The market is perhaps okay.  It is however very tiny.  I was not that impressed.  Did not buy anything as I did not see anything that I wanted.
0;How do you mess up a grilled cheese? I don't know but this place did. It smelled like fish! The fries were mediocre, but at least they smelled like fries. Plan to go elsewhere to eat after you see a show here.
0;I will never shop at this Banana Republic again. Went there with my lil'un in tow and the customer service reps did not stop following me around the whole time I was there. I was looking through the sales rack and one of the customer service people would not stop talking to me and wanting to show me more of the expensive stuff even after I told her I was looking for some good sale items. After a bit, I chose to ignore her (i think she was the person in charge there) and she just stood there not 3 feet away from me just staring as if I was going to walk away with all her merchandise or something! This is the second time that I have felt like I was being stalked as a thief at THIS Banana Republic. Never again and oh yeah, corporate will be hearing about this one.
4;"My original online order from a different company had never delivered to my mother-in-law home for her birthday on time... so I called English Garden Florist for a \""emergency delivery\""! And they were EXCELLENT!! They saved my day!\nThe customer service (over the phone) were nice, efficient and professional!! The price is absolutely reasonable. And the beautiful floral arrangement was delivered to my mother-in-law's door step within 1 hour and half after I placed the order over the phone, on a Sunday! \nMy mother-in-law was very pleased with the FRESH BEAUTIFUL arrangement she received! Thank you English Garden Florist! Highly recommended!"
3;"When you think of ramen you would think Cup 'O' noodles but after coming here for the first time I will never think of ramen the same way again. The place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what I've heard from people that have been to Japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. The first time I visited Monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. I also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.\n\nThe food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the pork belly bowl all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. I've tried both the Shoyu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. In both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. So if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. The noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. The texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.\n\nI guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited Monta. So if your looking for a quick bite and want quality Japanese ramen come check out Monta it will make you say \""cup 'o' what???\"""
2;"THE GOOD: \n1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip. \n2.) INEXPENSIVE - especially after burning money on gambling, partying, and overpriced club drinks! \n3.) QUICK SERVICE - It's a freaking fast food chain...it better be.\n4.) MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.\n\nTHE BAD: \n1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items.\n2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation). \n2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!! \n3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win \""positive\"" awards. \n4.) SKETCHY AREA: There is a reason the place is caged up like minimum security prison. I've seen freaky things happen there - a guy beaten up and robbed right outside, the standard late-night fight between rowdy customers, and what looked to be an unfit teen mom with a half-naked baby that seemed to have horrible mouth sores (CALL CHILD SERVICES!!!)\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT: TACOS MEXICO...SURE WHY NOT!?!\nCheap, semi-dirty Mexican food is definitely a good cure after a Vegas night of partying, drunkenness, and debauchery. If you're above and beyond the clean, pricey late night eats within the strip (side note: GET OFF YOUR FREAKING HIGH HORSE!!!), then head down to the ghetto cuz Tacos Mexico definitely fits the bill!"
0;Food is barely edible......service is spotty and the place has a reputation for padding the bills and scooping up cash that does not belong to them
2;The food is good but they take FOREVER at this location. I've received much faster service at other locations. It's as if they have one cook in the back and 5 people on the floor. Management can you please staff appropriately. Still sitting here and it's been 20 minutes
2;I not sure what to make of this place - Kampong Ah Lee is a very traditional Malasian take aways and diner which serves big portions of what I can only assume are traditional Malasian dishes - they are very tasty and more than something different if you seem to always be eating Chinese take away and need something different, I cant remember the name of what I had to eat, but it was full of prawns and possibly even chicken and had lots of noodels cooked into it and spices. Yum!\n\nThe trouble is though that even with the big portions of good food, the price of this place is expensive. Also, staff are a bit on the grumpy side, but that is just a minor annoyance.
4;I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant. Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal. \nThe servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing. They're knowledgeable, friendly, and pleasantly enthusiastic. The food is always fresh, well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course. Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for? Oh, coffee too. \nI cannot wait to try the spring menu, I'll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile.
2;I was having a staycation and decided to try something different...how much fun can I have without leaving the Palazzo? The restaurant was nice, we sat in the booth right in the front window which was actually pretty cool. The wait staff was attentive and very professional. Honestly though, I've had better steak at the local steakhouses off the strip. Not a bad meal at all, probably made better by someone else picking up the check!
0;We visited the restaurant on my birthday. We were terribly disappointed. We ordered pizza and pasta and an appetizer. The food was alright not the same standards as years ago. The service of the staff was horrendous! We had to get our own drinks, look for our own napkins and they were demeaning. My 7 year old had the kids meal which included an ice cream scoop. They just came and said they ran out of dessert. No apologies, I will not return. They are sending me email to nominate them to have the best pizza? There are many more places out there with better pizza.
4;This place is awesome.  We live a half mile away and never knew it was there it is so tucked away.  Beautiful farm with tons of shade trees.  They have fresh produce for cheap, fresh breads, jams, honey etc.  Homemade butter is soooo good.  We bought some produce then walked around the garden.  Highly recommended.
2;"First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service."
1;After hearing everyone and their brother go on about how excellent Pink Taco is, I have to say that there must be another one somewhere else in town that's good.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good, either. It was average. The waitstaff was okay. The mediocre food came out quickly.\n\nThere are much better places in town.
4;Absolutely great food with local ingredients and not too expensive for what it is. I would recommend the rice bowl, soups, pretzels, and especially the sandwiches because the bread is amazing. Absolutely great. Great little place with outdoor seating and funky indoor seating. Fantastic food, great joint.
1;Clam chowder is too salty. Crab sandwich had a little bit funny taste. Hopefully the salads are better.  I'll come back and try again in a month or so.
0;Went with another couple to get caught up over Christmas time.  Horrible service right from the start.  Had to ask for everything.  Loud obnoxious group there at the same time so forget being able to hear your own table if there's a crowd.  Took forever for our food to come.  Forever for the check, which was NOT worth the price. First and last experience there.  Too bad cause we're locals who love Mexican food.
4;I love this place. My family and I frequent it. I love the bibimbap and the kimchi fried rice. They have great sushi also!
4;love this place love Sara
3;Preshow meal turned into an unexpected gem. Location with a view of the Bellagio fountains and a super friendly staff. Just wish the preshow menu wasn't so constricted.
3;I really am not a clothes shopper.  But when I have to go and refresh my wardrobe, this is a good place.  Great variety for all ages, well 30 and over.  Very sophisticated styles.  A bit on the pricey side.  The sales accosiates are always very helpful.  I'm not sure the reason why their sizes are set up differently but it works.  I likey.
2;All you can eat buffet. But be careful, you have to finish what you order!\nThey will charge you for whatever is not finished.  \n\nWe went with a group of 10. We had a whole table to ourselves and it wasn't very busy. We probably arrived there around 8pm. \n\nWe ordered a couple things at first so we can all share, but as we went along, we ordered more, which was perfect.  The different sushi rolls were really cool and really good! I got the Snow White, spicy octopus (2 pieces) and a number of others I can't remember. but Snow White was realllly good. The First Kiss sushi roll was also delicious.  \n\nI got the passion fruit saketini. It was good but it was really sweet and you can barely taste the alcohol. I would recommend getting the lychee saketini or ordering the buy 2 get 1 free beer (Asee, I think it was). \n\nThe udon noodle soup was a little sweet as well. But the soup was good to have with all the sushi. Jalepeno poppers was amazing and it wasn't spicy. \n\nWe also got the Japanese Lasagna sushi. it was odd, there was cheese, sauces, and panko (i think it was) on top. A whole mixture of flavors. it was kinda odd, weird, okay tasting. I'd say try it..but don't let it get too cold or else you won't want to finish it. \n\nUnfortunately, they don't have sashimi. :(  I really wanted that with the spicy red pepper sauce (choh goh chi jang).  But they do have \n\nI gave it 3 stars because they charge you for whatever is not finished.  :(  lol but the servers were really nice, really friendly and helpful.
3;have to write a quickie!\nthis was great, my BFF and i jumped on the rail on monday, and went to Casey Moores. i had never gone she loves the place. i was not disappointed, it was a beautiful day and we sat outside. services was great. beer was great. i had wings, i liked them. we did order potato skins,which had green chile's in them, kinda weird?? but i liked it, other people at the table didn't..\noverall i will be going back.
0;UGH.  I was hyped rehab for ... ever a couple of years back.  I was all hyped to go until I got there.  Seriously, I won't even admit how much of my life I wasted waiting to get into this frat house on crack. It's a shame. Seriously.  The only reason we waited that long was because that was the whole point of the trip.\n\nAnyway by the time we did get in it was not scorching hot, everyone was hammered the pool looked green (YES! What do you think these dirtbags are actually going to get OUT of the pool to piss?!) \n\nThis is the level of NASTY that you're working with: I was wearing a white bikini top with brown trim.. by the time i got to my hotel the white of my bikini was YELLOW. And I truly doubt that it was the amount of chlorine.\n\nThis place is nasty.  The only reason people like it is because these stupid skank girls go there practically naked.  Get a job as a stripper and call it a day ho-bag.  And the tool beefcakes that go there are all the same, L-A-M-E.\n\nThe bathrooms? Nasty.\nThe drinks? One plastic water bottle thingy of margarita-type drink was $35. Yes, Thirty-effing-Five.  For one drink.\nThe cover? $50. Stupidest waste ever.\nCrowded? There were THOUSANDS of people in that pool area. gross.\nThe crowd? Cool if you are 21 of if you have the maturity of a high school kegger party crowd still.\n\nThe one crappy thing about it was that I was at the Hard Rock's pool before Rehab started for the season and it was perfect.\n\nBut Rehab? I would rather go to the Wet Republic any day.
3;Im now in my mid 20's and figured it was time to find a family doctor just to make sure I  was healthy. After searching and searing(which is a drag) a friend of mine who works for Dr. Donna Miller(hear nothing but good things about this woman even though she is not my OBGYN) suggested I see someone from Nevada Family Care. At first I wanted to see Dr Karl but he was so popular apparently it was almost impossible to see him. I decided to go for Dr Fakhouri but he wasnt able to see me as scheduled. Because i was determined to see a doctor I went with Dr Barettoko and let me tell you am I HAPPY she was who I ended up with. Her bedside manner was outstanding. I havent seen a doctor in ages so I was a little nervous and boy did she make me feel comfortable! She was so nice and attentive to all my questions! I would suggest anyone to see her!! I wanted to rate this 5 stars but because of the run around to get an appointment and i thinking the office could use a little update i went with 4 stars.  But Dr Barettoko is deff worth more than 4 stars!
3;It's hard to pass by the bellagio and not stop for the free show. Each one is unique and well done.
2;Went here with a large group and the service was good. However, the food was okay nothing amazing. They have a nice patio which would be great for happy hour. The   bruschettas were okay and kinda pricey. They do not have as many flavors as postinos. I also felt the taste of the bruschettas were not well balanced. However, our group did have a nice time. Next time, I will not order the white sangria it was small, too sweet, and full of ice. I think this is a better happy hour spot than anything else...
0;This place was disgusting to say the least. Everything had a very off taste to it like it was spoiled/stale. The rice looked a day or 2 old. We took one bite of the food and our server crushed a roach right next to our booth. Yep that was it we paid and left and went and got a burger else where. This only got a 1 star rating because I can't rate it a 0!
0;do not eat here it is not worth the money
2;I prefer this location due to the fact it's clean,efficient,and the employees are courteous.\n\n   I've never encountered any issue's with my food, but be aware that sometimes that certain employee's may NOT understand certain words due to the fact English is NOT their first language.
3;This club is amazing once you get inside... The reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because getting in was so disorganized that it was ridiculous.  Even the bouncers didn't really know how everything was organzied because I saw the head guy pull everyone over and have a meeting right there and talk about how they let people in! Disorganized much? We were standing in the hotel guest line too and it ended up being a jumble of people standing there.\n\nAnyways we ended up waiting 45 minutes because they didn't have a set system of letting people in.  The person that was running the line finally felt sorry for us because we were told that it would take 15-20 minutes.  I would of left if it wasn't for the fact that most of my friends were in there already. (My friend and I had arrived on a late flight) Luckily we didn't have to pay but I think they charge $20 after midnight for ladies and guys pay $20 regardless\n\nOnce you get in though, the club is really nice.  It has a indoor/ outdoor portion which was nice if you needed some fresh air.  Drinks were really expensive but what can you expect from a vegas club.  There were areas where you could sort of sit down if you didn't get bottle service which -ladies - is great if you're wearing crazy heels and need a break.  The dance floor was nice and big so you didn't feel like you were getting smushed!  The crowd was good. A good mix of people a good ratio or girls to guys.  Definitely a place worth checking out.
4;Great place to store my stuff I truly recommend this location friendly service too. Will tell all my family and friends about coming here if they need storage. Thanks Public Storage!
0;"Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . \n       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a \""bank error \"" they said. You damm right there was !!\n       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem. Any way we went round and round finally about 2 months later they fixed it then I closed my account I did not want to until this was settled .. Another Bank now \nScrew you Ken Lewis ...hope you go to jail for shi..ting on little people!!!"
0;"This place needs some serious work. I admire the decor, it looks really hip and fresh, but food wise, this place is way too expensive, and honestly, poor quality. \n\nFAME seems like it's set up to be like a modern Asian Market Place with vendors lined up kind of like a lunch line. There was Fuku Burger at one end of the area, which my friends ended up eating at and said it was pricier than the food truck. I chose to go to the opposite side of the area, where they showcased duck and pork hanging (kind of like Sam Woo BBQ, if anyone is familiar with that restaurant). I ordered the duck and pork combo and switched the rice out for noodles (lo-mein possibly), which came out to $18. While I definitely thought this was way over-priced for something trying to mimic an Asian Market (where prices are cheap as hell, helloooo i.e. Philippines, Thailand, etc), I still gave it a fair shot.  \n\nStill, the quality of food was garbage. I literally saw them microwave the duck. They didn't cut it from the duck hanging in the window, and when the server brought the food to my table, she forgot my utensils and said, \""Oh shoot, I forgot to give you utensils, can you just get them?\"" Smh. Also, the manager scolded one of his workers in front of me for not giving someone a number card, really not professional. \n\nThe food tasted old, not fresh, and the duck was soggy. The pork was reasonable, but definitely not $18 worth. The noodles were so-so, oily, and not very flavorful, and the side vegetables were oily and also not fresh. \n\nIf this place wants to survive, they need to cut prices, work on quality of food, big time, and work on customer service. I was really disappointed with this place, be wary."
1;"All flash, no substance. That goes for the service as well as food.  You can say the waitstaff was trained to hear, not listen.  Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  \n\nI eat out.  A lot. And I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world, and not all of them expensive (that falafel joint in Marais (Paris)!) but Alize should really just give up already.  The 'we're so tech-forward' iPad wine menu (lame) and the view (lovely) can't save this place.  This is one of those places where insecure men take their ignorant dates with thoughts on impressing them with an expensive French menu and view.  There are so many great French restaurants in Vegas; if you want to impress, go to Joel Robuchon, Bouchon, Guy Savoy. Don't even bother with this place. And btw, half the people at dinner had a case of dinner regret the next day on their flights back home, if you know what I mean.."
2;A good choice for Mexican food
3;If you're visiting Vegas this is a really great place to check out. It's pretty much like a lounge/bar. This place is Beautiful inside and out! The music they played was awesome too. It's located in the Palms Hotel and Casino. The best part is the view! You are up as high as I believe something like 50 stories, and you can see the entire view of the strip. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing that's all I can say. \nIt did lose a star because it's doesn't have a dance area...but it's still worth checking out.
0;Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.\n\nThe prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away. \n\nThe Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.\n\nthe italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold. \n\nTIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold. \n\nthe only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....\n\nthe food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn.
1;This place is cool but I've had better Mexican food. The carne asada tacos are good, not a fan of there guacamole. I've also had better. My family liked it. I can go without coming here again. I loved the different varieties of meat and the spicy pork is the best taco here and of course I love my Horchata..can't go wrong with that. It's always overcrowded and you have to go on a hunt just to get a seat. Good thing is it's open late a good place for a quick grub or after the club hunger in Vegas.
1;Disappointing. \n\nMaybe it was because we were there for Restaurant Week, but the options were all overly simple (could have made all of it in under half an hour no problem) ,small, and somewhat bland. Not what I expected from an upscale place.\n\nFirst, our salad was just greens pretty much, and my boyfriend's shepards pie was small and tasteless.  My chicken was tender and well-cooked, but it was supposed to come with Mushroom sauce, of which I spotted about two drops.  Both of our deserts (apple crisp and chocolate almond cake) would have been better warmed up and mine had a weird after-taste of cherry cough-syrup.\n\nThe portions were extremely small too.  I can usually eat about half of a Wisconsin-sized dinner entree and here I ate the whole thing and was still hungry.  I know it's supposed to be a good deal, (for restaurant week), but not if they're portions are for babies.\n\nThe pluses include romantic ambiance and good service (my water was never empty - an undervalued part of a good dining experience).  Also - the chicken...so tender (but still so plain!). \n\nBut, I don't think I'm coming back any time soon.
0;Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff.
3;The entire City Centre complex is a magnificent display of human architecture.  Very beatiful - steel, glass, and building angles that leave you in admiration.  \n\nThe Vdara is a welcome edition to Vegas if your not a big fan of having to wander around a smoky, loud, and bright casino floor in order to get to your room.  The good thing is Aria and Bellagio are across the way if you need your dining, gambling, drinking, lounging fix.  \n\nVdara rooms  are more a studio  than a hotel room - however, i doubt the kitchen area is ever used in any substantive way - maybe for longer stays.\n\nCool technology includes automatic shade/blinds, and buttons to push for 'room service' and 'do not disturb'.  some the the lights i think are automatically set to the time of day.\n\nI did have a little issue with housekeeping - where they didn't do my room, but a quick visit to the main desk got it cleaned pretty past.  Also some of the lights were burned out.  I find that kinda strange.  \n\nNote: They are charging a resort fee of $25 that includes 2 small bottles of water, newspaper at check in desk, internet access, unlimited local calls, and tuck-in service.  I didn't use any of this stuff except for the water.\n\nI imagine this hotel is best suited for the business traveler who doesn't need the many distractions.
4;Oh Seaboat... your delicious fried fish sandwiches and fried okra are more than worth braving some of the most ghetto areas of Champaign in the dead of night...
4;Delicious! I was in tonight because of the 50% off locals offer-genius! Everything was really really good! Our server Jessica was fantastic and always checking up on the table! \n\nI highly recommend the hummus appetizer and scallop entree. \n\nMy one complaint would be that the scallops came out cold but they were delicious anyway! \n\nHighly recommended!
0;Wasted money. So getting a pedicure is something I get done 4 times a year because I need to. Not want. I've been going to the same place for years and they always do a great job while criticizing my feet. Today they did a half ass job and refused to finish it properly. They still charged me and my feet look almost the same as when I went in. I wasted money that I don't really have on something I needed for health reasons. I'll never go there again.
0;Figured I couldn't go wrong with Chili's.  WRONG!  Very limited menu.  Hamburger was nasty!  Will avoid Chili's Too locations in the future.
4;Honest and fair. The owner is the one who works on your car so you know he is serious about the business. Friendly and quick. It is a little pricey though.
1;A friend and I stopped here last night to grab a bite to eat and a sundae. The wait to get a table was long so we decided to do the grab and go window. The grab and go has a limited menu but still had some decent choices. The line moved fairly quickly, and and the person taking orders was plesant enough. \n\nIt took about 15 minutes to get our order, 2 corn dogs and a chicken cobb salad. The corn dogs were hot and fresh. The salad, well it left a lot to be desired. The tomatos looked dead and the corn, well i didn't see much. \n\nI would recommened to stick to the sunades.
4;The truffle corn!  This is my personal steakhouse, though there are many to choose from in Vegas.  You can also get genuine (non-poser) Kobe steak for $42 an ounce (last I remember).  I haven't had a bad experience here yet.
1;"Ordered a 12\"" tuna sub.  The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12\"" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location."
1;Meh. Exactly how I feel about it.\n\nOkay, I'll admit I'm new to this boba game.. I'm no expert on it.\nWe were in town square yesterday, and decided to have a small snack before dinner. I'm not into the tea, I like smoothies with my boba.\n\nFirst of all, you can get a much larger, and better blended smoothie at jamba or tropical smoothie, for about $2 less....and if you want to add boba to a smoothie, it's .50 cents.\n\nWe were the only ones in line, and it did feel like I waited a while for it. \nWhen I got it, I just felt it was lackluster. It didn't have a fantastic taste, and when I'm being charged for something I want added, I kind of expect it to last through the entire drink. I felt that I barely had any boba.... There was a single row that lined the bottom of my cup. The smoothie wasn't really blended either, it had large chunks of ice, making it very mehh.
0;I wanted to like this place but sadly I didn't at all!  The food was horrible. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, pretzel and a corned beef sandwich. The best thing I had was the fries. The wine was borderline undrinkable. The pretzel was decent but the cheese sauce was gritty and almost flavorless. The sandwich is where the meal went downhill! First it comes out with soggy bread. The meat is dry and has no flavor. The inside of the sandwich was cold while the rest was burn-your-mouth hot. I took a bite and spit it up because it had a half of an onion on it. Imagine the outermost layer of an onion on your sandwich not sliced at all!  \n\nThe whole thing was bad!  The service wasn't horrible but the server wasn't around much! I would rather go hungry then try to eat here again. Yuck!
3;We came on a Wednesday evening because a contact lens company wanted to wine and dine us. For drinks, I had an Italian margarita. Appetizers, we had fried calamari and a fried vegetable platter. My entree was 16oz NY steak and shrimp scampi and my gf had the 10oz steak and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had cheese cake and tiramisu! Full course! what what! haha\n\n- Easy parking. South of the strip. Near South LV outlets\n- Elegant vibe. Pianist playing classics. At one point, there was a live singer. I was surprised they did all this on a Wednesday. \n-  Great service. Multiple servers. Nice recommendations. Quick refills. \n- Italian margarita gave me a light buzz. Nice amaretto flavor, sweet and sour.  \n- Funny that we order American and not Italian. It's an Italian restaurant. \n- Calamari was average. Salty\n- Vegetable platter was good. I enjoyed the mushroom and zuchhini \n- I ordered my steak medium and it came to me medium-well. Fail. Gf ordered Med-Well, and it came well done. 2x fail. I guess next time I'll order med-rare to get med! haha\n- Otherwise, steak was seasoned nice. Not the best steak, but no real complaints\n- Scampi was amazing! Flavor was strong. Loved it. Wish it came with a bit more. I'm not sure if I'd pay $12 for it myself though. \n- The potatoes were presented in slices stacked on top of each other, which I have never seen before. Delicious taste and wonderful texture. \n- Cheese cake was ordinary. Far from Cheese Cake Factory. More like buffet-style cheesecake. \n- I had a great time. Nice ambiance. Video poker if you're bored. Good recommendation for a fancy dine out.
1;Poor guest service. If ur looking for service with an attitude this is ur spot. Won't be coming to this location again.
1;"The waiting area as you come in by the hostess was nice and well decorated. The hostess was welcoming and friendly; sitting at the bar the bartender asked if I wanted a drink and I mentioned about a drink I tried elsewhere to see if he has heard of it. He didnt but offered if I could find the ingredients online he would attempt to make the drink himself. I looked it up on my phone and showed him the ingredients and his version was pretty good as well. Entering the dining area was a surprise as it was a lot smaller then I anticipated. It can make for an intimate dining experience but also falls to increased background noise due to its small size. The table was nice and presented well; the staff seated us and pulled the chairs out as well as placing the napkins on our laps. Dining as a vegetarian for this meal was challenging as the menu did not have many vegetarian choices but the waiter helped out and created vegetarian dishes from what was on the menu. The presentation of all the dishes were good; the food itself was good from the chilled pea soup, to the salad and vegetarian risotto. It just wasnt great; it all tasted good but I was not blown away by it. The desert was probably the best part of the meal as it had a unique presentation and tasted delicious. Overall the dining experience went well, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, good wait staff but I just felt as something was missing that didnt make it a great dining experience."
4;Great!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Staff is extremely courteous.  Try the jade chow mien and salt and pepper pork.
4;In love with this place! Just love the cocktails and the vibe it has. Moscow mule is sooo yummy! Service is always great. Make sure you make a reservation if you want a booth, they get pretty busy.
1;Sales are a joke. The clearance was only 20% meanwhile the same things at another BRU on Northwest was 50%. I guess their rent is much higher here. They have good amount of selections but the prices is not so hot. I'll be shopping at a different BRU. Thank you very much.
0;"I have seen several shows here, and despite the over priced and weak drinks, nightmare security, and disgusting bathrooms, I come back because I like music and apparently no one bothers to check how bad a venues reviews are before deciding to play there. That being said, I attempted to attend a show there recently. My friend, that has a brain injury, was confused by security telling her she couldn't have gum. And a pen. GUM! I'm well aware of this anti-gum stance they have, but she was not. When she questioned the OVERLY THOROUGH security \""lady\"", she was denied entry, security claiming she was intoxicated. So, next day, I call to speak to the General Manager, Donnie Johnson. This man is horrendous. I was spoken to very condescendingly, and in a manner that gave me the impression he flat didn't believe me or CARE at all. When my friend called him, he literally shouted at her, told her it was her fault for not informing them in advance that she had a condition like that and that the marquee \""doesn't employ doctors as security\"". Then, he gave her \""to the count of three\"" to tell him what she wanted. She's not THREE YEARS OLD! When she didn't answer him quickly enough, he hung up on her. Great customer service here. I'll never go back. I have a lot of free time. I'll be voicing my opinion all over the internet."
2;Came in here after a four hour hike because I was craving a nice big salad. I ordered a house salad and a Chicken Cesar Warp. It was my first time ordering a wrap from a restaurant, it was pretty delicious I must say. The portions were nice sized and the service as decent. My one complaint is the deep fryer was down therefore I did not get to try their onion rings oh and the ranch could have been better. Other than that their prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back especially on a game night. They have really good foond and specials on game nights.
4;I can't wait to try everything on this menu.  We got smothered burritos that are massive and you have a choice of red mild or hot and green mild.  The red hot is great.  We had a colifornia and a regular carne adasa - the meat was tender and flavorful.  The only other thing we got was a fish taco to try it - it was also huge and so delicious - with a lot of fresh guac on top.  They have a huge selection and I really hope they do well - the food speaks for it's self.
3;A great after hours spot!  Atmosphere here is very lively. The decor fits the time and mood when you get there. Good high tempo music and did I mention, its free to get inside =) \nAt least when I went on a Friday night through Saturday morning.
1;I never write bad reviews but I feel I owe it to other potential customers to warn them about the terrible food. The first indication that the food would not be up to par is when they serve steak with 5 different sauces. I true filet does not need any condiments. They then served us COLD fries, we sent them back to be reserved, still luke warm. We also ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (which are my favorite) and they were chunky pieces of rubber! I don't know how you mess up mushrooms but they managed to do it. To sum it up the food is not a five star experience. We dropped $200 on dinner were I would have been happier with McDonalds. \n\nWith that said...yes the food was terrible but I must admit the service was impeccable! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about food and wines, polite, and accommodating.
3;I was here about two weeks ago and ordered the kids pulled pork. It comes with waffle frys and a drink. The sandwich was plenty big for a lunch.  You can also make yourself a ice cream cone when you are done. \n\nThe sauce is average to good but needed a kick, so I mixed the regular and the spicy. PERFECT. \n\n10/30/08 Update\n\n1pm and it was empty. There were 3 people in the place. \n\nI had the bbq brisket, kids meal. It is enought for lunch for an adult taht is for sure. The brisket seemed to be left over or waiting in some hot juice before serving. It was not bad but it was not great. I would prefer the Pork. \n\nLess then $5 with frys, drink and a pickle and ice cream....not a bad deal.
4;Highly recommend this place. AWESOME customer service. They fixed my shattered iPad screen in one day. I bought an Otterbox cover for the iPad, hated it, brought it back two weeks later and they exchanged it for a Survivor ... No questions asked.  Love to support local Tempe and these guys are the best.
4;The weather was finally nice enough to eat outside on the patio.  The music was so loud that I had to ask our server to turn the music down.   We had another $40 Groupon for the 3 of us.\n\nWe ordered 3 rolls of sushi and a salad.\n\nVampire Roll ($11.95): Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab, Seared Albacore, Jalapenos with Garlic Ponzu sauce on the side.  I liked this roll and would order it again.\n\nSpider Roll ($10.95):  This is my favorite roll and we have ordered it every time.\n\nSalmon Skin Roll ($6.45):  I liked this roll so much that we ordered it again.  This time it was drowning in eel sauce.  Next time I would ask for the sauce on the side.\n\nAhi Poke Salad:  This was my favorite salad and we have ordered it a couple of times.\n\nWe will be back.
3;After our first visit this week, I think we've found our newest favorite pizza place! We've lived in our house for about 15 years and eat pizza 2-4 times a month. We had never heard of this place. We were in the mood for some 'za and decided to look online for something different from our usual haunts. A Yahoo search turned up this place just to the edge of the map. The attached Yahoo reviews looked promising and a quick look at Yelp sealed the deal. We decided to give it a shot. \n\nI'm ecstatic! As long as they're consistent (except for below), this is our new place! Keep up the good work Lucky's. We're lucky to have found you! \n\n-1 star = Our wings were overcooked (making them tough) but the sauce made them very tolerable! Definitely not a deal breaker!
2;I like the food at buffalo ww and our service had always been great. They serve coke zero which is a plus to me. They've let us sample sauces before ordering which leads me to trying new things although I always get naked wings with side salad. Surprisingly not too bad calorie wise.  The reason i don't go here more often is it is so loud. I understand its s sports bar so that's on me but it could come down a notch at least when its not a big game.
2;Experience:  Met a group of friends here for dinner. There was about 8 of us.  We got here at 6pm on a Thursday and we were the only patrons here. By the time we left two hours later, there were about 25 more people there. \n\nFacility:  This is a dark modern place, that has a rocky roll kinda feel. All the other patrons were dressed in black...not sure if that was s coincidence or not. They have about 12 TVs showing various movies and sporting events. Music is a mix and not too loud to have a good conversation. \n\nService:  we got a cool waiter who was friendly, informative and easy on the eyes. \n\nFood:  we ordered the cheese sticks to share and they were good.  They were homemade and came with a small portion of fries too. \nThen we got two pizzas to share. The white pizza with mushrooms and the green pizza with eggplant. \nThe white pizza was my fav of the two, but could have used something like chopped tomatoes or black olives to cut the richness of the cheese. \nThe green pizza had a pesto sauce that was good, but the eggplant was flavorless. \nI also tried two beers. One was the Troublesome Gose, which was a good one. \nThe other was the Bockor Vanderghinst. This one I really enjoyed.  It was a cross between grapefruit beer and a stout, but lighter. \n\nOverall:  I liked this place. I would definitely come back with some friends. Good atmosphere, decent food, a little pricey, and great staff.
0;I've been waiting a few weeks before posting a review because I wanted to be as fair as possible. On the good side, this company was prompt to return my calls & were sort of on time to appear (they came at the very tail end of their time window.)\n\nOn the bad side, they sent someone who didn't speak very much English & he couldn't understand what I wanted to have done on the trees. I was really hoping for a real arborist who could help me understand the different options, but I ended up just pointing and hoping for the best. When I came back after running some quick errands, I found most of my tree on the ground & somehow it still looked as scraggly as it started! I called the owner to complain and he said a) that I didn't know what I was talking about, b) that I was looking for a free trim job, and c) that he could come by to look at it and to tell me that he thought it looked good (his opinion from the few cell phone photos that the trimming guy sent to him.)\n\nThey've been calling every few days to see when they could come and tell me that the tree looks fine, but honestly, I don't think that will help me feel better at all. I don't really want to talk to them again after being so insulted when I was really upset over the bad trim my tree had gotten from them...\n\nMaybe if you speak Spanish and already know everything you need to know about trees, this would be an okay company to try, but I think that the owner should really consider whether or not he should personally meet new clients to better understand their needs and also really, really consider what he says to them.
1;It's been a few years since we ate here last.  In Lucille's defense - I am not a huge restaurant BBQ fan - I much prefer the delicacies that the sexy hubby chef produces in our backyard.  However - this is the restaurant my son picked so we went.\n\nThere are really no complaints about the food really - it was neither Ohmygoodness awesome or Boythatreallysucks nastiness.  Food was warm and tasted good - just not memorable to me.\n\nSons got a rack of babybacks, tri tip and brisket - they all enjoyed them.  Since I am going to have backyard bbq deliciousness tonight - Hubby and I both went for the NY Strip - they were delicious - just not mind blowing to me.  Our dinners came with corn on the cob - didn't enjoy the bruised parts all over it though.\n\nWhat annoyed me though is a couple of things that had nothing to do about the food (Maybe I was just in a bad mood)...\n\n1.) We made reservations and our party of six arrived about 15 minutes early - there were plenty of places for our party to sit and there was no other parties waiting - so why did we have to wait?  Once they finally got around to seating us they stuck us clear in the back - I just don't like the layout of the restaurant very much - the back rooms feel closed off from the rest of the restaurant and the small room we were in felt somewhat claustrophic and our party of six was crammed in like sardines - even though there were other places to put us.  I hate being squished!\n\n2.) We were seated right next to the table that had our server's sister and boyfriend.  Guess who got the amazing service we should have had.  Our service wasn't horrible - I just felt like an afterthought.  She wasn't rude - just was more interested in talking to her sister and her date instead of checking in our her other tables.  Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date. \n\n3.)   Like I said - maybe I was just in a bad mood - but why oh why every time we have gone here - we get seated near the large parties with annoying little kids - I have been there, done that.  I never let my kids screech to their hearts content when they were little - and the five year old - running around their table and screaming - Grrrrr!   \n\nI am really not in the mood to go back anytime soon.
0;Disappointed. The noodles in the chow mein were no more than plain spaghetti noodles.  Nothing had that great of quality. The cashew chicken was alright but I've had much better.. Everything was just ok, don't think we'll be trying again
4;I went here again for the second time. OMG!!!!!! the Salmon was delicious. It was the best salmon i had forever. The outside was crispy and the inside was just right. Of course, we also got the duck too. That was the best dish in the restaurant. It's really worth it for a nice dinner for two. Very pricey but well worth it.
0;I used to come here literally once a week. My staples were the cheese crisp, chips and salsa, Red Corn Chicken Taquitos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chicken Maxamillian and I have tried just about everything on their menu. \n\nI was here opening day at this location. I used to LOVE and adore Macayos. Until about one year ago. They hired a new manager. It started with a lot of great waiters who knew me by name dropping off like flies. Still, there were a few left and I perservered through crappy service to get the food. NOW every SINGLE time I go the soda is flat, the cheese crisp is not cooked correctly, and the service is aweful.\n\n It has steadily been becoming worse and worse since Anne, the manager started. I'm not trying to attack her personally but clearly she is not doing it right. My chips are always cold and I have even walked out because it was so crappy. This is coming from someone who has gone to Macayos since BIRTH. For 23 years I have been 'frequent' and since age 18 I went literally every or every other week. \n\nI LOVED Macayos, it was my FAVOURITE in the world, and now I cant stand to go.  It used to be a friendly, happy family atmosphere, with good food, awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda. No longer. Not since. I have tried and tried again to relive the glory days, but I think it has seen and passed them. I went to Macayos in Tucson and it reminded me of when this location was great. Sad times.\n\nI have literally spent THOUSANDS here. But now I wont spend a penny, unless I hear management has changed.
3;"when the mother wants lobster, to red lobster we go. it was a bit different when i went to college in maine and she came for a visit but hellsya red lobster brought the goods tonight, specifically tim, our waiter, and as the hostess referred to him as she sat us (i think all red lobster wait staff may somehow go by the same title but tim was ridic), our \""seafood expert\"".  \n\nfirst, tim fielded the 129 questions about substitutions from my mom like he wrote the book on jewish mothers. it was like he knew that when my mom tries a bite of someone else's food she returns the spoon or fork with half of the original food on it.  when we asked for an additional spoon for her to try my soup, he brought her a little plastic cuppy of soup just for her, to avoid half eaten food on utensil interference.  \n\nsecond, my wine pour was generous and appreciated. third, i don't know what the fuck is in those buttery delicious biscuits but hot damn they were buttery delicious (for anyone who comes to portland or lives in portland and reads this, imagine pine state biscuits times 2347) and fo freee and tim kept em coming. \n\nchains often get a bad rap, and often for good reasons. but tim the seafood expert + decentish lobster+ buttery delicious biscuits + big wine = 4 star.\nmy only negative is that they are really pushing this design your own festival of shrimp shit a bit too much.\ni have now unbuttoned and am ready for the rest of a night with mother, which will likely involve law and order, cribbage, and our daily routine of shitting on sheriff joe.\ntoy lista"
3;I never did get to try that Ostrich Burger :(. O well.\n\nSo this is the place my friend and I always eat at while waiting for connecting rides at the nearby MegaBus route. Thank god it is so close, because Pittsburgh is a ghost town and there pretty much is no where else aside from fast food to eat. \n\nTheir fries, sweet potato, or regular, are awesome. Get extras if you can!\nThe burgers, sandwiches, etc all do the trick. I get some turkey sandwich with an excellent honey mustard sauce and sliced apples on it. Never though to put straight up apple on my meat, but it is something different and really tasty.\n\nFriendly staff, usually adorning accents and food wisdom. Ask them for help. \n\nThey also always let us loiter in their seating area for hours after, utilizing the free wi-fi.\n\nThank you Sharp Edge for making lay-over so smooth!
2;Corporate burgers has options.
2;Stayed here for two nights last weekend, room was small but clean with one exception......a fish hook stuck in the carpet that I had the pleasure of stepping on.  Luckily I reacted fast enough to not have to make the emergency room visit to remove said hook.  I do not blame the hotel for this but regardless it wasn't pleasant.\n\nAll in all a decent stay.
1;If I had use one word to describe Lino's I'd say overpriced. My experiences with Lino's was ordering a Lino special pizza , Chicken parmigiano sub , Chicken picatte , Lino's calzon and two meatballs on side. The dough on the pizza was hard like a rock , the sauce was flavorless but the toppings were seasoned correctly and in good amounts. The sub was typical but really dry. The chicken picatte tasted like spaghetti with water. The calzon was typical but really small for 11$. The Meatballs were the right size and had just the right amount of seasoning on them. Overall their food was mediocre and overpriced. As for the customer service  , it was friendly , they took care of my order with no problems and delivery was about the right time on arrival 40min.
4;Super yummy!  I have only had their lunches but I hear breakfast is amazing.  I recommend the turkey jalapeno press, the Biltmore Club chicken sandwhich or the chorizo burger.  Their salads are also lovely.
2;The Light Group are pros and whether it's David Christian or anyone else on the team, I've never heard them spin a bad set. But if Justin Timberlake and Andy Sandberg were acting like jerks here, they'd be dicks in a box, because this place is basically a small box. And it's hard for a box to compete with ultra-lux poolside nightclubs like Tao and XS.\n\n*** in LV, but would be  **** in NY or Miami and ***** anywhere else in the U.S.
3;Three words, Thai Yoga Massage. Wonderful experience. Staff was friendly and courteous and the locale itself is just lovely.  Four stars not five is because I was expecting a different sort of  Thai yoga massage. =p Nevertheless it was a fantastic experience.
0;"This place has a \""dress code\"" which I noticed only applies to people of color. I was turned away at the door on a slow night and I saw 2 white men dressed the same as me: t-shirt, sneakers, and a jacket. All my clothes are in great condition. Glad I didn't have an opportunity to waste my money here."
3;Awesome meals, especially for the price. I was raving about that the entire meal. And I think I was a fan of the margaritas. I really couldn't remember or drive home.
1;Started going to this place because it was so close to my house. I always get my eyebrows threaded but this place makes it unbelievably painful. I think its the type of thread they use. Also I went to the new girl and she messed up my eyebrows and never even apologized and when i asked for the more experienced girl to fix it she had a total attitude. The ustomer service sucks and it hurts wayyyy more than it should.
2;In real life this place is a 3.5, but I definitely would say it rounds down to a three for Yelp purposes. \n\nThe music was great on Saturday: chill, talented, smooth - made for an excellent double type type atmosphere. Lots of people, but not too crowded, meaning we were able to carry on conversations and listen to fine jazz without yelling or feeling like we were interrupting the performance. \n\nUnfortunately, this place only felt the need to operate with one bartender, resulting in snail-esque service speeds. Also, orders coming in from the servers took priority over mine, even after the drinks were partially made, which pulled me away from my group and made me quite thirsty, both being awful occurrences. The bartender had a lassez-faire attitude while the servers had a gruff and hurried demeanor, definitely drawing away from the overall chill attitude of the place. \n\nI liked the atmosphere enough that I would go back for another try, but if the service was that poor again I would probably avoid a third attempt and decide to spend my two-drink cost of $16 on a bottle of liquor, make my own drinks, light some candles, and change the TV to BET Jazz - wasting 13 minutes twice in the same night away from my date waiting for drinks is not the way to create a good post-bar atmosphere.
2;I only Mcd's for their breakfast sammichs, apple pie or sundaes. Other than that, this place is nassssstay!\n\nDon't forget to ask for military discount!
0;We decided to try O'Shay's on a Sunday and we felt like we walked into a scene from the show 'Bar Rescue'.  This place needed it!  The 'entertainment' consisted of a lone man screeching out tunes to his electronic music and drowning out any type of conversation and audio to the sports game playing at the time.  I saw one guy with his hands over his ears, it was that bad.  But it was his comments that literally floored me.  He stated that if we had beers and a tv at home, then we should leave to go watch the game there if we didn't enjoy his music.  He also stated that if someone wanted to pay him 20 bucks, he would stop playing.  Really?  I kept looking around for a hidden camera thinking a joke was being played on us.  Our waitress was very understanding and helpful, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to ever bring us back.
4;For my Very First Review, I wanted to do a no brain-er. \n\nThis is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. If you Love beef, you will love this place. At about $50 per person it is pricey but the beef has awesome flavor and it's all you can eat so get your grub on. \n\nIf you Vegetarian, you can get just the salad bar and it is still incredible. I can't give this place enough stars since it is the only restaurant that easily pleases both Carnivores and vegetarians! \n\nI've been to this location several times and each time the food has been amazing. The truly greatest thing about this place is the consistency. Each time we have gone the service, food and experience has been the same. Amazing. \n\nMy personal Favorite is the House special. It has great flavor and is mouthwatering. The lamb is also great. each cut is great in it's own unique way. If you like well done or rare, ask the server and they will ensure you get it. Believe me you won't regret trying this place.
2;Stopped here on the way back to California.  Not the best Dennys experience I have had.  Our waiter was Arturo... didn't say his name, and reached over the table (and our food) during our meal to exchange the condiment rack.  Really that couldn't wait till after we were gone?!?\nOtherwise the food with standard, hot,  served quickly, and was very good.  I had regular coffee and the seasonal pumpkin pancake grand slam, with a lot of the whipped butter on top. That was good!\nWas disappointed that they don't have caramel coffee anymore.  But hope to see it again in the future.\nOverall it was an average Denny's  experience, and I would return when in Phoenix again.
0;Don't understand how anyone could give this place anything more then one star for the simple fact of attitude. The food is ok, that's worth the one star. But the people in this place are so RUDE. They need to take some anger management lessons. No matter what you go in there for you get an attitude. My suggestion is go in don't look at anybody that works there don't ask any questions or think your able to buy anything on display. They get very upset and nasty with you if you buy something from the case that they have to replace.
3;"Great burgers! Way better than some other burger places in tow, in my opinion. Not too greasy, perfect portions and decently priced. They have enough options to get what you want, but not too many to make your decision like seem like you are contemplating adoption. \n\nThere Smash burger is great, and if you add on their Smash fries you will be in heaven! (smash fries - reg fries with rosemary olive oil and garlic) \n\nThey are pretty quick too, so if you have a limited time for lunch this is a good option. They also have some great options for the little ones and a few other things to try other than burgers; veggie burgers and hot dogs."
0;Service was was not good at all, the waitress took forever to have our order placed. the other people who sat around us (who were seated after) all got their orders in before me and my date, the waiter never checked on us and the food was terrible, especially the hash browns... Will not be going again.
2;I made the mistake of stopping by on a weekend afternoon during the middle of a game... Not an available seat in the place. Placed my order at the bar and sat down on the window sill (yes that is correct) and chomped down on a double bacon cheeseburger. \n\nThe people and place were great but the food was average. I don't have any desires to return. Perhaps a bar chaser would enjoy the atmosphere more as they definitely cater to spirit chaser given the large bar area. If you are looking for some insight in that regard, I'm sure my fellow yelpers have posted several divining reviews on that subject.
1;Food and service very inconsistent.  Last time we were here the owner was in and everything was great - food had great balance and you could actually taste each ingredient.  This time, not so much - ribs were very spicy but not a lot of taste other than that...  Food was cold, slow service.
1;After reading raving reviews of Glass Nickel Pizza, I have to say it was underwhelming.  I have honestly come to prefer Papa John's.  But then again, I don't eat meat so I wouldn't take this review TOO seriously.  I'm sure their other pizzas are good.
4;Awesome check-in deal and not so pricey to begin with... the receptionist was nice, they had free wi-fi and actual current magazines besides like Motorcycle Monthly and WebMD that you usually find at other auto repair places. Big plus, they have tons of free stuff like water bottles, cookies, tea, ice cream, coffee, etc.
1;Despite its friendliness and cleanness, Pho Hung failed in the food category.  My Pho was lukewarm at best.  My fiance's shaken beef was small in portion and quality of beef subpar.  My mom's seafood pho was salty and, again, lukewarm.  C'mon, pipping hot broth is a MUST for Pho or else it wouldn't cook the bean sprouts, let alone the rare beef!!!\n\nI hadn't had Pho for more than 2 months.  Pho Hung failed to revive my love for Pho.  I think I'll skip Pho all together when I am in Vegas from now on.
4;Just like New York!  Great Friendly family service! The food...Ah-mazing!  We wanted to try everything- we settled on the lasagna, baked ziti, and meat ravioli. We also got a side of meatballs and tried a slice of white pizza. All were sooooo yummy- the sauce was perfect! We will be back because there is so much more to enjoy!
2;Here with my family. Kids meals were huge and fit for an adult. Wife ordered chicken flautas and they were a little bland. I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce... It was good.  They were generous portions on everything. Chips and salsa were ok. The environment was was nice old world Mexico and the service was good! We will be back.
4;amazing! need i say more!?
2;Yes I'm reviewing this....why not?  Just an Scottish version of a Hooters bar, whats not to love.\n\nBut of course, the food as expected isn't all that great, but the ladies are shall I say, have nice outfits and truly warm up to you.  Cheers to ASU.  Heck, you even get a collectors card to take home and show your wife and kids.  \n\nFor the upside, at least it made my trip to Tempe somewhat memorable, even though it required venturing outside to Phoenix for a drink and grub.  Just a 30 min travel away and 2 transfers.  \n\nFor the food:\n\n-Garlic Fries - bleh, although its the skinnier type fries, no one does it better than Gordon Biersch\n\n-Spinach Dip - bland and too chunky\n\n-Grilled Buffalo Wings - I got like 3 that were burnt, and although its supposedly different from the deep fried type, they were just like the ones you cook on the bbq, except .....more burnt.  I didn't enjoy it that much I had myself to blame since I was craving wings for some reason.\n\n-Side of Dublin Stew - Probably the one thing I'm glad I got since it was sort of like a Shepards Pie in stew form.  Tasty and pretty filling.\n\nAs for the drinks:\n\n-After all, the bar was just calling out to me and although I had hoped to see more beers on tap, unfortunately, a majority of their beer list was bottled.  I went with the Kilt Lifter...something that sounded rather appropriate which turned out to be like an IPA but toned down and had a sweeter taste like that of a Hef.
3;Frozen Grasshopper, my first shake EVER.  The presentation of it caught my eye first.  As a waiter who walked by had it on a tray, I just had to ask what it was called.  After contemplating, I order the grasshopper and enjoyed until it got to that melted consistency - then I just gave it to my b/f to finish.  For food, I was having a difficult time deciding (once again), but got the Gold Standard Burger w/ steak cut fries.  A pretty juicy burger that had good flavor.  I was so full when I left! ... full, but satisfied.
3;"This place has more \""cool\"" atmosphere than anywhere else downtown and you have to be ready for that.  The hipsters will be everywhere and the DJ in the corner won't really be doing anything....but it's a cozy place to go with a friend or a date and certain menu items are incredible.  The brie and apple pizza is unlike any other and they usually have a special pizza that can be just as amazing.  Also, the Three Cup Tofu, while a bit pricey ($9.50,) is fresh, unique, and so good.  Other than that, the menu is small and too expensive, so get a Caipirinha (one of the only good ones in town) and enjoy a nice, mellow night out."
2;Went to Rufus on the Thursday night before the August long weekend - it had been recommended to us by a local Montrealer. At first the girl who greeted us could not find out reservation for 8. The bartender stepped in to help us... and we were seated. It took about 20 mins for our server (the original girl) to take our drink order and we should have assessed that that was a good indication of the poor service that would follow. \n\nI don't know if it was because we are anglo (and this area of town - Little Burgundy/Grifftintown is predominantly franco) but she was slow to help us, rude and kept ignoring our requests for drinks...water...napkins..etc. At one point my husband walked up to her in the restaurant and asked politely if she could come over as we all wanted to order more drinks - at which point, she proceeded to have a 10-15 min conversation with some guys sitting at the bar! I was in awe. \n\nI must say though - the food was very yummy. It seems that they change their menu periodically - when we went, it was a take on Japanese street food. The soba noodles were extremely flavourful,...agedashi tofu - YUM..and who doesn't love dumplings? \n\nCocktails were pricey - $14 range. I ordered a margarita and it was straight up but NOT over ice...\n\nThe decor leaves much to the imagination...let's just say it looks better under candlelight.
3;Now and again I like to mix things up with the chain coffee shops, and here say now I felt like doing just that.\n\nAs CN has moved into the fort, I thought i give this shiney, squeaky new baby a whirl.  \n\nIt's almost like the actual building was made for this purpose.  It has a great mezzanie, which gives massives of height to the front of the store.  Plenty of seating, although it looks like it can get pretty full very quickly.\n\nStaff were pretty friendly too, although behind the counter for them it looks ergonomically a tight squeeze serving us customers going back and forward.\n\nI had a toasted panani with mozzerella and grilled peppers and milano hot chocolate - I just would like the hot chocolate to be full if request no cream and hotter than it was with or without cream.  Coffee is ok too.  \n\nNice change to sbux or costa and a nice addition to the fort.
4;Was there on labor day weekend and it was a great experience. Even when the place wa packed we got sit right away and the food was delicious: I ordered a pizza and it was awesome, My son ordered the meatloaf and that thing was finger-licking good, my daugther oredered pasta and that thig was home made and extra good. My wife ordered the sliders and that was also awesome. To top it all the service was great! love the place and we will be back!
0;Service is awful. Waited over 25 minutes just to have our order taken. There were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us. We were getting ready to walk out when the waitress finally came over. Never again.
0;Absolutely horrible. Just horrible! If you decide to sign up with this poor excuse for cable or Internet service, be prepared to get a bill for a different and higher amount each month. Top that off with the worst customer service in the industry and more bad reviews than I care to read through and you have COX COMMUNICATIONS! I'd rather just go without than to deal with them. I'd give them zero stars if I could.
0;Worst floral experience ever. I ordered through FTD. Thank goodness I chose to have them deliver it to me and then I would deliver it to my mother because what I received was the worst arrangement I've ever seen. I couldn't possibly give it to my mother for Mother's Day. Different vase, old flowers - just awful. FTD called the shop to try to mediate the situation and the shop was completely rude and adamant that they did nothing wrong and refused to do anything for me (return or replace). FTD finally gave me my money back. I will NEVER order from them ever and will tell everybody I know (including you Yelpers) to never go to them. There are so many other great floral shops in town.
2;"I came here to find some gingham ribbon and they did have some, but overall, I thought the selection, organization and width of all the ribbons were a bit limited. When I was checking out, you're made to go through a maze of racks so you'll buy more bs impulse items, so needless to say, it's a little confusing of where you're supposed to enter. Well, I entered the wrong way and one of the cashier girls was quick and curt - \""line starts over there!\"" Geeze."
4;Super great place. Food was good friendly people. We ordered take out and while you waited they gave his ice tea. They alway make you feel welcome when you come in. Place is very clean. You have to come and eat here.
1;Meh....seems to be dropping off.
1;"I'm going to preface by saying that the staff is really awesome.  Hostess was sweet, our server Courtney was wonderful and a manager came out and checked on us.\n\nBut the food is so gross.  Not gross like in a McDonald's sort of way, but just bland, blah, whatever.  We went for a happy hour and they offer \""$2 off\"" type of things, not set prices like $5 for this, this and this, etc.  Know what I mean?  Just wasn't my thing and I won't go back to spend money on food."
0;"The positives?  The easy to look at hostesses/waitresses and lavish las vegas styling.  The negatives? This place is a misleading and stupid.  \n\nWe were reeled in because it was \""Happy Hour\"" & the hostess said appetizers are half price and the drink specials are two for one draft beers or 2 for 1 stoli or patron.\n\nSo, we sit down at the bar lounge area and order a beer thinking we could get two drinks for the price of one and order half price appetizers.\n\nEnds up we were not allowed to order half price appetizers because there was a miscommunication between the hostess and waitress.\nTheir mistake but the staff/management didn't care.\n\nFine, we're thirsty and want some beers.  I'll order two beers for my good friend & I, for the price of one per the happy hour special.  The waitress brings us four (4) drinks for the price of two!  WTF?!  The waitress undeftly explains that each person has to pay for a drink to get the special two for one price!  Who's heard of such lunacy?  The terms and conditions, i.e. the fine print, weren't available to us upon entering this establishment.  We felt slighted & swindled.\n\nFirst Food & Bar stands for them being first, leaving the customers a distant second."
3;I went here after seeing this restaurant featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Drives.  I wasn't quite sure about the mixture of Mexican and Chinese food...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is a little confusing, but the girl at the counter was helpful in explaining it.  There was plenty of food and it was tasty!.....One of my creations was the carnitas in a quesadilla.......Mmmmmmm.....try it out!!!!!
1;Decided to give this place a try based on all of the great reviews. Upon entrance, very clean. Service was quick and the staff were friendly. The food: I ordered the family pack which consisted of 25 strips (baked/grilled), fries, veggie kabobs, and mac & cheese. The strips were just ok. Nothing special. Mac & cheese was bland but I loved the cheese topping. I loved the veggie kabobs and TX toast. Fries were just ok. Tried all of the different sauces and my fav was the BFG & Honey Mustard sauce. Overall, I probably would not come back.
2;"This place will become the next Hooters.  In fact I have a friend who calls this place \""Celtic Hooters\"".  The first week it is open and it is packed.  In fact it is always busy, which makes for a fun experience.  The servers are in the magical 19-20 age range (old enough to serve, not quite old enough to drink) range.  Pretty girls, who will make small talk with business men.  As a female, getting service here is a bit tougher. I would advise going straight to the bar.  The food is standard pub fare, they have a good beer collection along with ciders.  Overall, you come here with a group of friends, lots of televisions.  Good place for a basic HH with friends you want to see but not actually talk to (it is pretty noisy in there), and face it, the pretty girls in reallly really small outfits are distracting, (and I'm a girl).  There are lots of servers, but like I mentioned, the girls really chat up the patrons, so you may or may not get speedy service."
2;This is a great store: Clean and a good variety of vegetables. The vitiamins and nutrition items are fresh and priced well. \n\nToday I did not receive the wheat germ I paid for, so if you go in, watch the bagger, because I saw him place the wheat germ in a plastic bag with another item.I brought cloth bags, he gave me the first item to put in the cloth bag, but failed to give me the wheat germ. Unfortunately I am not the type that calls back to get my missing item, so I'm out the money. Next time I'll keep a better eye on my purchases.
2;"\""If you build it, they will come\"" - but maybe not to Chase Field, well... unless the team is winning of course. But even then, they will only come depending on the food options and free promotions available to them on that particular day. \n \nAlright Diamondbacks Nation... well maybe not nation, maybe Diamondbacks fans? Nope, there aren't enough of you for that title either. What about supporters? Maybe groupies? Well whatever you're called, where are you? You've got one gorgeous baseball field and a World Series title, yet this stadium sits lifelessly in the Arizona desert.\n \nIt's sad actually. Chase Field is gorgeous, and dare I say... breathtaking. Stretching far and wide across the Phoenix skyline, Chase Field stands tall among the buildings that call downtown Phoenix home. This technological work of art brought baseball to the desert, and that's quite a feat. Even some of baseballs greatest players, like The Big Unit for example, have called it home. Sparkling clean and strategically situated for easy access and parking, Chase Field calls out to \""D-Backs fans\"" - begging them to venture though its towering gated entrance to seek sanctuary within its cool climate controlled atmosphere. All of the vendors, ushers and ballpark staff at this stadium are also welcoming, helpful and friendly. There isn't a bad seat at Chase Field. The view is virtually perfect from every angle. Yet the seats remain fan-less. \n \nI do understand part of the reason why fans don't flock to Chase Field. An empty stadium is a common transplant state/expansion team symptom, like the desolate Tropicana Field for example. Most people in Arizona probably aren't even \""D-Backs fans\"". I get that. I'm not one. But even I pay more attention to the action at Chase Field and have more admiration of its beauty than a majority of those \""D-Backs fans.\"" \n\nIt is as if \""D-Backs fans\"" are confused, and they think Chase Field is an indoor shopping mall - because in between the shopping, the food, the activities, the awful emcee that talks in between innings, the dancing and the trivia games, none of the \""D-Backs fans\"" seem to have time to watch baseball.  \n\nSo \""D-Backs fans\"" - you need to up your appreciation level for the game. It's the roar of the crowd that brings a stadium to life. Team pride is what makes or breaks a ballpark's atmosphere. And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste. So stop swimming in your indoor ballpark pool (I still can't believe how tacky that pool looks in the outfield), worry about what ice cream extravaganza you are going to stuff your face with later, and let's watch some baseball! \n \nIt's called game time \""D-Backs fans\"", not play time."
3;I am VERY picky about take-out Chinese/Asian food restaurants, and had completely given them up for many years  However, this place is legit: Clean/well kept, good quality food, decently priced.
1;Don't sit at the bar...... No one helps you.\n\nThis is by far the worst service I have ever had. I love Grimaldi's the pizza is great but the service was just terrible. Up front stand three hostess' that cannot figure out how long the wait was. Each one of them said a different time, and were extremly rude. One finally said the bar was open seating so for the first time we sat at the bar. I noticed a huge party leave from the patio so I asked a hostess if the patio is open seating, it was not so I then asked if the wait was still as long. She informed me that people were ahead of me (which was understandable) however no one was waiting. So I went back to the bar and said its fine we will just deal with it. Some better spots outside opened up so we moved seats from in the bar to the outside bar area. I watched two tables stay open the entire time of our meal, which was 2 hours long. I was ready to leave had I been able to tell the waitress to cancel our order. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase in the end the amazing pizza made up for the terrible service. I love the pizza and next time I think mabey I will order it to go.
3;"If you want Vintage, this is were you go.  I am vintage hound and this place sparked a interest with me.  They have decent men's selection which a lot of trendy store seem to be lacking. \n\nThe coat section is pretty awesome.  Vintage leather, Suede, corduroy, you name they had it on the rack.   The had some good sizing too, I am a skinny lanky dude.\n\nEverything is well laid out and organized well.   The prices are high, but you can get some great 1 off vintage items here.  I am still hope to get a \""leather sweater\"" in my size there."
0;"***UPDATE***\nAfter posting the following review, I was contacted via Yelp by a person calling herself \""Kate G.\"". Kate stated, \""I would like to get your phone number so that our corporate side can look into this and discuss.\"" I asked Kate G. who she was & she stated she was Landry's Social Media Coordinator. Why didn't you tell me that in your first e-mail? Ummm, I don't hand out my phone number to random internet contacts!\nWhy on earth would I give my phone number to Kate? Does she think I want to be bothered my her or Corporate? I can't be bought off with a gift certificate from Landry's. I will never eat there again. I filed a complaint with the Southern Nevada Health District!!! So, listen up Kate G., you can NOT have any of my personal information. May I suggest you introduce yourself before asking for someone's phone number. BTW, I still have nightmares over what happened to me! \n\nI got so ill after eating here I thought I would die. Never again! I had a steak, loaded potato, green beans & one glass of wine. I'll have PTSD whenever I think of that night."
4;Love the chicken tacos. Best I've ever tasted. Very authentic Mexican food. Great selections of Mexican drinks as well. I'll be back again and again.
1;I actually thought Ka was better than Mystere. Both plots are vague and you really have to watch to follow, but Ka was a bit less vague and actually showed progression through the characters, even if the audience was left to jump a few conclusions. \n\nThere was one part though that was just unbelievably ridiculous. They used some video game looking designs and we were basically watching action on a screen. Um, no. But other than that, some solo/duo scenes were breathtakingly beautiful, which is why I'll fork up two stars.\n\nFunny though, at the end, when the cast comes out,you'll notice that the majority of them is Asian (we folks are good at acrobatics, I guess?) LOL\n\nI excitedly paid around $170 for two tickets, with front and center seats, but I will definitely not be back to watch Ka again.
3;3.5 stars? My issues with Wynn management notwithstanding, the actual food at this buffet was great. My favorite dishes were the quinoa and brussel sprout salads, crab legs, rack of lamb, and charcuterie selection.\n\nNote that traditional eaters who want the 'usual' buffet fare might be disappointed, as almost everything here has some kind of twist or modification to make it stand out from the pack.\n\nDessert selection kind of lacked the 'wow' factor I was expecting, although the tres leches and creme brulee were yummy. I didn't try the crepe station, a decision I now regret. :( \n\nThe lines were really out of control. 45 minute wait in the regular line and 20 minute wait in the 'VIP' line. Although, it's not their fault they're popular.\n\nMy only real complaint is the service. Our waitress seemed depressed and was very inattentive, visiting only once to give us our drinks and another time to refill them, never asking if we needed anything else or how our meal was going. The bulk of our service came from the busboys, a pattern repeated at the Wynn's other restaurants during our stay.
3;Finally headed back to this restaurant after a long hiatus (they closed for a bit and I may have forgotten about them once they reopened, my bad for sure).  We were happy to see that the menu was a bit updated but it really was the same great place it was before.  \n\nWe have only been here for breakfast and it is always good.  The egg dishes are what I typically go for and I am rarely disappointed.  If you enjoy sweet breakfasts do try Merci's french toast.  It is different but different in a very good way.  Their coffee is great quality and honestly, sometimes I enjoy heading over to Merci just to enjoy a great cup of coffee along side a freshly baked croissant (or chocolate croissant...).
4;"We had a wedding lunch here a week ago.  The food was delicious and very nicely presented.  Susan (the owner) was great to work with and went the extra mile to ensure we had a wonderful experience on an exciting day!  Susan accommodated our needs and was very helpful and flexible during the planning process.  \n\nFor those of you looking for a unique and fun option for special events in the Gilbert area, especially those looking for something close to the LDS Temple, this proved to be a great option.  Susan accommodated almost 100 people.  \n\nThe pulled pork and chicken salad sandwiches were excellent!  The pasta salad and fruit salad was spot on!  This was followed by a variety of \""house\"" specialty desserts which were to die for!  We give Susan and her help at The Gilbert House a well deserved recommendation!"
4;Food: \n- 5 stars!!! - Cheese curds, gazpacho, lamb meatballs, pork tenderloin, mac and cheese, stuffed dates\n- 4 stars - chicken and waffles, fillet w/ gnocchi\n\nDrinks: \n- 5 stars!!! - Rye whisky old fashioned\n- 3 stars - French 75\n\nFavorites: Lamb meatballs, tenderloin, cheese curds, dates, gazpacho\n\nService:\nAccommodating, knowledgeable staff and service.\n\nAmbiance:\nMid century modern decor with a romantic and cozy feel. Love it!\n\nOverall, one of the best restaurants in Phoenix bar far. Very impressed. Can't wait to go back.
3;Harlow's is hands down my favorite breakfast joint in Tempe. Their portions are generous and always delicious. Definitely order a side of their biscuits if it doesn't come with your meal. They are Baked fresh and come out still steaming. Can't beat em!
2;its walmart...nothing else to say
1;We were there around 10:30 on a Friday night, looking for some post-concert dinner. The bar part looked more hopping. The dining part was decidedly not. The food was at least cheap, thanks to their half price munchies menu after 10pm.  \n\nI tried the individual pizza. The cheese was rubbery, the toppings scant, and the crust resembled more of a quesadilla than a pizza. The sweet potato fries was the highlight of my meal.
3;Both reviews for the place are great but I think they forgot to mention one key problem with laser quest. \n\nThe game has started and you're darting around looking for cover. While hiding behind a pillar to avoid the hail of lasers that threaten your life, you hear some footsteps approaching from behind you. You turn quickly to ambush the enemy, only to find out he's 7... \n\nSomewhere in you're brain, alarm bells start ringing. Even though it's fake, your mind hesitates a little to shoot a kid at point blank range. By the time you've bypassed that thought and pull the trigger, he's already buggered off. \n\nIf you're playing with kids, you'll loose (but you're a good person!)
2;Not much has changed round Cameron toll since I was dodging about the place as a lad.\n\nMainstays such as BHS, Boots, WH Smith and the epic Sainsbury's are nailed to the ground, unlikely to go anywhere, and still my personal main draws.\n\nThen there are the collections of phone shops, travel agents and budget drug stores. In the way of diversity, there isn't much. A bookshop at one end, a couple of clothing stores I wouldn't venture into, and a Game store for the local geeks.\n\nIt pretty much covers all bases for what the locals might be in need of, so on that front it is fairly worthy. But not the kind of place you'd go out your way for.
1;Glad I came here with a Groupon because I was not impressed. Definitely not a place to pay full price at. Small portions, big price, mediocre food. Enough said.\n\nOh, also, worlds slowest service. I don't recommend this place.
0;Terrible service.  The food is typically good, but not consistant.  My experience today was bad enough that i'm certain i'll never go back.
0;Service was terrible and the food was just OK.  The best thing about this place was the cheese crispi but not worth coming back for.
0;"My experience here has left me with no words. Bad service. Mediocre food. I can definitely say I'm never coming here again. It took over 20 mins to get our table some water and the waitress didn't own up to her mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the water. When we got the water, it tasted horrible. Our hotel room sink water tastes better than that. The food came so late as if they left to catch the fish we were going to consume. The waitress then forgot to put in one of our rolls and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a \""human error\"" as if she wasn't even sorry about it. As we received the bill, my friend realized she got spicy tuna when she had wanted yellowtail. All in all worst place ever! The only decent person was the busboy. Avoid the waitress with a feather tattoo behind her ear."
2;"3.5 stars\n\nI've tried 2 restaurants at MGM Grand: Craftsteak & Seablue.  I would rather come back to Craftsteak.\n\nCame here for my sister's 21st birthday dinner, there were 8 of us.  We ordered many dishes to share as family style dining which included: Halibut, Dayboat Scallops, Prime Angus Flat Iron, and Prime Bone-In New York Strip.  Our dishes were served with: Chickpea and Lentil Rice, Jumbo Asparagus, Olive Oil Smashed Potatoes, and Medley of Mushrooms. Everything was \""okay\"", the only dish that stands out that I would definitely order again is the Scallop - it was delicious.  Other than that, I don't think it's worth the money for average tasting food.\n\nOh, and they definitely need to redecorate this restaurant - please."
4;I love this place! Everyone here is great, personally I see Keri and she always does such a fantastic job. She's very thorough and professional.  Definitely nicest place with always the best results and everyone is so friendly!
2;This location has a high turn around rate. It seems they have a new managers and employees every month. As far as their sub sandwich , they're at the bottom of the crap list compared to ports sub or jimmy johns. I like their flat bread and cold cut meat . Avoid everything else like their cook meat . Their bread is also drap n dry also. I hated subway for a couple years and realized it's the bread I didn't like . Now it's ok.
1;Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at.
2;I got there at 6:30, so there wasn't a line to get in.  When we left around 8, the line was long. I would say it looked like people would have to wait an hour to get in.  Not sure if it was because we went early, but the oysters and sushi tasted like it was sitting there for a while.  So I don't recommend that.  The chicken and waffles is a must.  The meats look delicious, but tasted a bit dry and too dry for me.  The desserts look great and are showcased so.  The gelato is nothing to rave about but the crepes are good.  I think you can have dinner just trying one of each dessert!   Overall, for $55pp, it's not bad.  I think because we went early, the food didn't move as fast, so a lot was sitting around, but food should be consistent no matter when you go right?
2;An attempt at a NY slice. I have eaten here a few times and all in all a three star attempt. Not a bad attempt but still not NY. Why is it so hard to make a good NY pizza here? Everyone uses bottled and/or shipped water anyway. This issue continues to allude me. The staff was great--- 4 stars for that.
3;There was a cornhole competetion going on when we got there. Clean, good pizza and calzones. Bucket of beer for $10. Not bad all around, but might question heading into that part of town at night.
0;I choose the regular oil change service for $24.99. This included oil, oil filter, top off fluids, check tire pressure and clean front windshield. The premium service is $34.99 and includes everything mentioned but will also add washing all windows, visual inspection of brakes and vacuum the interior. In addition to my $24.99 service I had my coolant topped off for another twenty cents.  The reason why I gave one star is because I was charged the premium price but got the regular service. This could have been just a mistake but according to the service checklist on my receipt they did charge me for premium services. So I inspected under the hood and noticed they didn't top off the coolant, which was an extra charge, didn't fill the radiator overflow, didn't wash any of the windows and didn't vacuum. I even had to check to see if there was fresh oil in the engine. According to my receipt all these services were completed and checked off.  If you're looking for a professional shop to work on your car I suggest you take it to another place.
3;I was so happy to find real food at the airport.  The service was friendly, my wine was delicious and reasonably priced- considering the location, and my food was good.  I didn't time the arrival of my food, but the place was fairly full and I still received it promptly.  I chose the open-faced chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and it was far more than I could eat.
1;Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.
3;First experience with Indian food and omgosh what an impression! Highly recommend!
2;This spot totally lives up to the hype! The most amazing MASSIVE sandwiches ever. The kids had the fish, the wife had the rAgin Cajun and I had the pastrami! Everything was outstanding. And to top it off we were fortunate to get a picture with the lady who appeared in the episode on DDD. Worth traveling for and very reasonable prices for such large portions.Im home now and i cant stop thinking about that sandwich lol
0;"Horrible!!! This is no way to treat veterans! The doctor that attended to me was so unprofessional he kept saying \""do you know what I'm sayin?\"" too much slang! I felt like I was talking to some one on the street. It's was so uncomfortable I wouldn't even talk to my friends like that I not want my doctor that is supposed to be educated to speak to me like he's in the hood."
2;Nice staff as mentioned in a prior review, but they have replaced the steering rack on my Silverado 5 times in the past 3 years!!!!! Yes, that is right, and after the one they recently put on 8/26/14 is leaking and loose. That means it is going in tomorrow. I just paid $252 in labor to put it on as it was outside of 6 months. The steering hose was leaking and they replaced it for free. Mike the Manager tries his best to make things right.
0;Went to eat buffet. This is the Worst food ever I eat. All the dishes are tasteless. I won't recommend this to anyone.
3;The ONLY place to stay in downtown Vegas.  Period! Just went under an almost complete remodel.  Rooms are fresh and spacey.  New pool is really neat (reminded me of the Maui resorts).  Fabulous. \n\nCasino is laid out well, and easy to navigate in.  Buffet is worth it, and other restaurants are of higher quality \n\nYou can walk to the Fremont experience and see all of what you want to see in downtown Vegas from the Nugget.  \n\nSearch their website and other internet sites for great deals. This is definitely a 4 star hotel, and some great bargains for stay can be found at certain times in the year. \n\nSure, its a long way from the Strip, but it seems to be more friendlier and cozy.  \n\nTry it, you'll like it !
2;"My mom, my son & myself stayed here for a night.  The location is fantastic - everything one could imagine is within a 1-2 mile radius.  Food, groceries, gas, etc.\n\nWe did NOT eat breakfast here so I cannot comment on that. \n\nThe beds, although they claim they were doubles, were nothing more than a slightly over sized twin; my son & I could barely sleep comfortably.  \n\nVery quiet though considering it's right off of Greenway & 17.  \n\nA decent value."
4;Yama Sushi is my favorite sushi joint until I can find better. Most of the specials are tasty and the nigiri is good. My faves are man whore, sun of the beach, and something else with crunchy eel. Their seafood salad is excellent I could just drink up the sauce haha. Gyoza is good, yakitori is good, mussels are okay. I thought both the soft shelled crab and deep fried mussels were tasteless. I think the worst item they serve is the BBQ Beef. It is thin beef shortrib that is super chewy and rubbery and tastes like salty garlic. I hope they improve on it - at least grill it.\n\nI appreciate the excellent customer service no matter how busy it gets. An even better fact is that you can have as much ice cream\nand mochi ice cream as you want.
2;Arrived around 10 so a little late but not crazy. No waiting but the place was fairly  busy. Drink order was a little slow. Food came out fairly quickly and was prepared properly. My steak was very fatty but tasty. \nAwesome bread. Overall a nice place but texas Roadhouse is better and less expensive :)
2;The atmosphere is really cool but the options were not that great. I got a veggie sandwich and it was not that great.
3;GREAT burgers! Good service. And it doesn't break the bank! A solid 4 stars all around. \n\nI'm usually skeptical of gourmet burger joints just bc there are sooooo many out there now. A burger is a burger right? Well no not really. And BurGR proves that you can still make a piece of meat between two pieces of bread pretty unique. \n\nHubby and I tried the place out on a Thursday night about 6pm. We stayed at planet hollywood and every time we go by BurGR There always seems to be a line. But we were told 25 min and it really took us maybe 15 min in line. You can get in faster if you opt for one of the high top tables which are teeny but it'll do. Good view of the TV to catch some of the games.  I got the chanterelle burger which doesn't come with cheese but you can add on. I opted for Fontina cheese which worked great with the arugula, mushrooms and fig jam. My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious. What I like about the burgers are that they're not huge and unmanageable to eat. They fit nicely in the hands and are the perfect portion at least for us. \n\nThe truffle Parmesan fries. Very good. Not too truffle-y. We also had the jalepeno poppers which were delicious!! The floor mgr came to check on us and gave us a funny tidbit, that in each batch of poppers there's one where they leave the seeds. apparently  my hubby got that one bc he bit into it and felt like his face was on fire. But the poppers. I highly recommend them. They have bacon inside them, hello!!\n\nTo finish off our dinner we got the sticky toffee push pops which were delicious and just the right touch of sweetness to end your meal. Good beer on tap too. A nice solid place to grab a tasty meal and not go broke!! Good service too.
2;It was very inexpensive to stay here for 4 nights, which was why we chose it. The room was clean, but the ventilation blew cigarette smoke into our non-smoking room, which was pretty gross.  You also get to go up to the top of the tower for free if you're staying there, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  Wasn't horrible, but probably would never stay here again because of the smoke.
1;We had a 3 night stay here that was part of a promotion.\nWe expected a nice hotel with the name being well known.\nWe had an upgrade, which was probably good. Our room was ok. The biggest complaints were no coffee in the room. Together a cup in the morning I had to go to a coffee shop in the lobby and pay $3.75 for a \nlarge cup. The TV stations were very limited too \nThe lobby area, casino and restaurants did not thrill us. I had one breakfast here that was just fair. Service was slow.\nIf you are booked to stay here by a promotional company make them out you into another hotel. CheckYelp, it is right more then wrong.\n\nNeedless to say, this will be our last visit here
4;"Oh my!!!!!\nWe just learned recently, The Beaver Choice does catering as well.  We took a \""small\"" Sandwich Cake\""...IT WAS HUGE and a HUGE hit at the Christmas Party we went to last evening.  Everyone was in awe of it.  How do I describe such a thing.  Let me try.  Lots of delicious sandwich spreads,,,really more like salads...you know egg, tuna or crab salad.  They even make them with ham or roast beef too.  \n\nOurs had tuna and egg salad nestled between cake layers of bread,  Then to top it off...a light spread of mayonnaise as frosting and then it was topped with shrimp, dill sprigs and some luscious caviar as well.\n\nWe talked to Hannah a few days in advance of our party and she handled everything.  The \""cake\"" was ready when we arrived shortly after 5p yesterday and was kept cool in their refrigerator case.  It was stunningly beautiful and I regret only that I forgot to get a picture of it.\n\nThe cake is beautiful to look at and people at the party certainly ate first with their eyes and then of course, they devoured it quickly.\n\nJust a note.  A sandwich cake is not finger food and will require a plate and fork.  But oh, so delicious.  It was a creative and unique culinary highlight to the evening.\n\nThanks so much for your work on this.  It made the party so much more festive.  Way to go!"
1;We went here for a celebratory dinner.  I envisioned high end service with a smile.  It's all an appearance.  The waiter was nice but frowned the entire evening.  We were there for late reservations so they weren't even busy.  The food was unimpressive.  Over price and over rated.  I won't waste my money again!
4;LOVE this place. Whenever we have guests in town we take them here, and everyone loves it. Such a unique experience with all the couches. Their happy hour offers some really nice pricing.
0;"Three of us stopped for breakfast. I had raisin bread french toast scrambled eggs and bacon. I love scrambled eggs. I left the majority of them on the plate. Why? They tasted wet and had no flavor. Made me think were scooped out of a warming tray in the kitchen. I did ask and she said the eggs are \""whipped\"". She did go on to tell me that I could \""order your scrambled eggs anyway you want them.\"" That is a first. Two small pieces of bacon that were burnt. French toast was good with the cinnamon butter. I looked at the ranch potatoes on my father-in-law's plate and they looked like they were scooped right out of a steamer.\n\nGood food should have a nice smell to it when it is delivered. This did not. Over priced, slow service, food that tasted the furthest thing from fresh-made. Save your money and do not even stop. Drive on by as anything will be better than this restaurant."
0;I had never made it to this show in 10 years of trips to Vegas, now that I have I wish I had done something else. It is similar to a lame theme park show, maybe good for kids but not worth the time for an adult. If you happen to be walking by, sure stop and watch but don't make a special trip.
1;Not the best place to get your toes done. They use cheap polish, mine smudged like an hour after I left the shop. The massage chairs are nice and they do have plenty of great magazines. Just go here if your desperate!
4;Employees are great and the food is wonderful I love their sesame chicken!\nThey also deliver!
2;"Although our piza and salad was delightful, we had the Pear and Walnut salad and the Pizza Napoli, the staff was kind of smug and unfriendly!!\n\nWe called before going, at 8:45pm, to see how late they served and were told 10pm.  We arrived at 9:35.  The girl said, \""you know we close at 10 right?\""  We told her we would eat quickly.  She replied, \""I have to mop the floor, but we have a big party back there so you should be alright\"".  I found this a very unpleasant way to begin our visit here.  I mean it wasn't like we walked in a 9:55 and expected 5 star service.  After all, it is only pizza and salad.  Anyway, I let it slide.\n\nThen, when the guy brought us our pizza, I had noticed a \""New Times, Best Pizza Winner\"" sign, so I asked him if they had won this year.  He smugly said, \""Oh, I'm sure several years\"".  I thought that was a crappy way to answer my question, since I am very familiar with these awards and didn't remeber them winning ever.  Apparently they one the reader's poll once back in 2007.  Whatever.  I might go back cuz the salad was bomb."
3;This place is out of the way but worth the drive. It is sort of a nightmare to find in this little office park, but once you step in, you are transported to the other side of the world into a Euro-cafe. Well maybe not exactly, but it's a great Vegas simulation. \n\nWe ordered a salad each and a sandwich to share. The sandwich was a feature not on the menu that day, Moroccan-inspired chicken with goat cheese and roasted peppers. It was fantastic. I scooped every last bite up, even though I'm trying to not eat meat or cheese. (I fail so miserably at my self-imposed dietary restrictions.) The salad was awesome too, with almondy jicama slices and a lot of other veggies. \n\nThe highlight of the meal, other than the great service provided by Oliver (who seems to be the owner?) was the chocolate torte. This was incredible. Perfectly sweet and rich, I felt the need to run a half-marathon just to get its sugary creamy goodness off my hips. \n\nI wish I worked closer so that I would have an excuse to go all the time. Loved every bite!
3;I like red curry, normally I go for veggie because I don't trust the quality of the meat in most Thai restaurants (not usually high-end). Because of the higher-end atmosphere and higher prices (not by much though), I tried the beef. Best decision of my life. Succulent. Also, wonderful service, extremely professional and on the ball. \nMy boyfriend didn't like his food as much, only due to personal taste, as it wasn't a flavor he enjoyed.  But go red curry go.
2;"I've lived here for about a year now so I figure it's safe that I've experienced everything I need to for making a review. I'll make this simple via pros/cons. \n\nPros:  I like the style of the building and it's proximity to downtown and the freeways. Pretty easy to get to many different spots from this location via I-15/95 to 215. The staff that work in security, valet, HOA, and maintenance are all quite friendly. Parking for guests is valet only which is nice so they don't have to park on the side/back which is a pretty shady area. Another reviewer posted about valet blocking the inbound parking entrance, that has been recently changed and the valet is now due West at the entrance loop thus no longer blocking the inbound lane. The building is VERY secure. Current regulations do not allow guests in the building and up the elevators without being escorted by a resident. Cameras at all entrances, in all elevators; have not noticed any in the garage. Key fobs to get in from garage, from lobby to elevators and inside elevator to your floor. This place has become locked down like no other place in town.  The gym is a very nice and clean facility. The pool, while nice and generally clean, is a bit stark in its design and landscape/hardscape design. The lobby and common areas are kept quite clean; likely varies by floor and if you happen to live with slobs on your floor...mine is pretty good in this regard. I've only used the concierge for dry cleaning and that is a nice feature to have. Choose Tiffany cleaners, not the other company they are setup with. \n\nCons: The majority of the units only have one assigned parking spot deeded with the unit and the spots are about 20% more narrow than they should be...cramped and door dings possible. The recent security lock down due to hookers, pimps, drug dealers inhabiting the place creates a big inconvenience for us normal folk. Guest drives up, security calls you, you grant access to valet, guest walks to security desk in lobby and you must come down to the lobby to escort them up to your unit; pain in the ass. I get the reasoning behind this rule and hope if/when the thugs and losers are kicked out we can go back to the proper system of security sending the guest directly to your floor electronically as it should be. The area around the building...shady and crime ridden. Do not walk north of the property alone or at night is all I can say. Laundry in the units is a horrible one piece stacked unit...it's loud and will ruin your laundry quickly. Water pressure delivered to the unit is horrible. I've had people out three times to resolve, still horrible. I feel sorry for those that have long hair as you will not properly rinse out the shampoo with this low of a pressure. Should you wish to take a bath...plan ahead!  It takes 24.5 minutes to fill my tub; yes I timed it. The tub/shower combo is a poor design...the outter edge is round; it's hard to explain but good luck keeping water INSIDE the shower when you use it, your floor will be wet and you've been warned :-)\n\nOverall I'd give this place a 2.5-2.75 if I could but felt somewhat generous due to the cleanliness and friendly staff. Not sure how long I'll stay...grass is always greener you know?  Price per square foot is high if you compare to a normal apartment or house but is lower than the overall Vegas price per square foot for hi-rises."
0;"Ehh...\n\nWe decided to try this local sushi/teppenyaki place for a friend's birthday. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service!\n\nDifferent items were given at random times. The bento boxes came first, and all of the raw sushi (which doesn't require MUCH preparation!) came last...I seriously waited for more than an HOUR for my nigiri! It wasn't even a busy Thursday night! I noticed that the sushi chef was just serving those at the sushi bar, and the waitress didn't even try to bug the chef to hurry it up! I was the last one to receive my food! The food wasn't even that great either! The salmon nigiri was kind of slimy, and the spicy tuna was just alright; The rolls were seriously not worth the wait! The waitress tried to be nice later, after I told her that it took TOO long, and she gave us 4 bowls of green tea ice cream on the house....didn't really win me over...I still feel that I should have been comped for it...\n\nWe ended up staying at this crappy restaurant for almost 2 1/2 hours! I will never go here again! Please save yourself the trouble, and go somewhere that you know will have GOOD sushi (even if you have to drive far!)!"
1;I went here to do some gambling off the Strip.  I lost just as much money here playing the slots as I did on the Strip which disappointed me.  I was expecting at least just slightly better odds?  Oh well.  Also, too many of the slot machines are right near the doors and I was there when it was cold outside.  The waitresses ignored me (it would have been nice to at least be ASKED if I wanted a drink).  We ended up getting food at TGIFriday's because everything else had a super long line.  So overall I regretted leaving the Strip for this experience.
2;We decided to try the famed Carnegie pastrami and corned beef inside the Mirage.  We put our name in for a booth and waited less than ten minutes. Bravo!!!  We sat down and all decided on the Woody Allen, which was a pound of corned beef and a pound of pastrami on two slices of rye bread.  The pastrami was tender and moist , but the corned beef was a bit on the dry side.   We did add their spicy mustard to liven up the meat and tried their whole pickles which were zesty and tasty.  The corned beef was exceptionally lean with the pastrami being on the fattier side.  Nothing to get really excited about, but fun to try.
4;Love this place. Food is consistent and I think really good. Wait staff is available but in no way try to hurry you. It's relaxing and comfortable. The burger, pizza and chicken sandwich are excellent choices.
4;This is my fav place to eat at while in Vegas.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The salsa bar is awesome, and the fajitas are incredible (I get the shrimp).  The food is great here, the service is also perfect, and I love the atmosphere as well.  Rarely have waited for a table either.  Usually play poker at the hotel, then walk over for dinner.  Highly recommend.
0;A big college football Saturday and they had 2 bartenders. Horrible service, okay food, and they change the channels to anyone's whim. Meaning, if a top 25 team is playing and two nothing teams are playing there is no rhyme or reason to changing the channel. Won't be back.
0;"Avoid. I went to see this dentist about tmj. I paid $75 for consultation (which most dentist waive or apply toward treatment) for him to tell me he couldnt recommend any treatment until alignment issues where corrected with my chiropractor. He also sold me a temporary nite guard (the Aqualizer) for another $75. One which you can buy online for $25. One month later the night guard popped and i called in to the dentist to advise. The response was buy another or you should have come back sooner. Both the receptionist and the dentist preferred to lose a patient over an item that would have cost them peanuts to replace or rectify the situation somehow. The dentist actually insisted that i was paying more for his \""EXPERTISE\"" even though i paid his \""expertise\"" separately. Well he can keep it, along with his outdated office. A dentist should be more concerned about his patients than his pockets. Ill gladly take my dentistry needs elsewhere."
4;Wonderful variety, small portions and great favors. Perfect for a special occasion. Ambiance could be improved.
4;As a long time Mesa resident, I was excited when a friend wanted to take me to her new fave with the weird name. OMG. Please, thai this one on. \nThe Thai toast is so good, with a sweet sauce that comes with making it one of my favorite apps ANYWHERE. \nBest entrees, Evil Jungle Princess, Black Pepper Shrimp, Green Curry, Pad See Ew (sp?) and the Laarb salad. \nGreat service, including sodas that are free refills (not from the fountain!) and good prices make this one of my favorite Mesa eats. Only downside is that there's never enough rice and they make you pay for more...
2;At midnight the fries are a dollar each and burgers are 3-4 USD. They are really delicious and totally worth the money if you have a late night craving. Although I don't recommend the sweet potato puffs - get the regular fries instead. Oh, and the nachos are just delish!
4;This place is quite amazing. Lets start when I first walked into the cafe, quaint and clean. That's how I like my restaurant. Guy behind the counter said pick where ever you want to sit. Thumbs up, even better. Sit towards the back of the restaurant. Waiter comes out to give us the menu, small chitchat, he takes our drink orders. We look over the menu, classic German fair (schnitzel, sausage, etc) I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and a side of Red Cabbage. While waiting for my food, (enjoying a Warsteiner Pilnser on tap!!) I took notice to all the decor. The German flags, the US flag and all the Berlin posters was a real nice touch of ambiance. The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child, eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree, I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow, it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. I fully and whole heartily hope this place does well. I will be visiting this place as frequently as I can. I hope everyone gets to have the same experience as I do.
2;I met some friends at Burger 21 for lunch. All the staff was very friendly, they made a point to make it feel like a normal sit-down restaurant despite the fact that you order your food at a counter. They bring you and pick up your food when you're done. They have a large menu, including several burgers, chicken sandwiches, turkey and veggie burgers, sweet potato, regular, and cheese fries. For a healthier option, they have a few salads. However, it gets a little pricey when ordering because fries are not included in a combo price. They also have many delicious milkshakes that add to your overall bill. A sauce bar adds some uniqueness to burger 21- they have around 10 different sauces you can dip your fries in or add to your burger. Overall, I enjoyed Burger 21, but I wouldn't be able to eat there very often considering it is pretty unhealthy. I mean, how can you go to a burger place and not indulge in a burger, fries, AND a shake?
3;Only been there a few times and then got a card that comp'd me 3 nights in March and 3 nights in April.  Room definitely showed it's age, same and dark, like you would see in an old mystery, but clean.   \nI think I found my new hang out, love the gaming, the girls and location.  I will use my April comps and they have a new customer.
3;Fast Eddies is your typical diner! \n\nGreat fast food, great service, low prices! \n\nI am a big fan of their patty melt, and I love the crinkle cut fries! \n\nWe've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner and haven't had any bad experiences yet. \n\nThe decor is lacking, and scary and I feel like I am on the tilt-a-whirl but other then that, Eddies is good if you just want a good bite to eat with out any fuss.
1;"Have always enjoyed the Mediterranean food and very quick service here. However, the past two times my boyfriend and I have been to Aladdin's it has been bad news!\n\nSeveral months ago we were eating dessert and in the middle of the German chocolate cake we were sharing, we found a big green spot of mold!  So this means that the cake was old and/or stored at an incorrect temperature... gross either way.  The manager took the dessert off our bill and that was it.. no offer to discount the check, etc.  Think about it, we ate half of a piece of moldy cake that you served us.. not charging us for the cake is a  NO BRAINER.. but what are you going to do as a way of making this better? They did nothing and I don't like to make a scene so I let it go.\n\nA couple nights ago, recovered from the mold incident, we tried Aladdin's again.    But, my Kibbie was ice cold in the middle and had to be sent back.  It disrupted our meal and was an overall bad time.  Again,  no apology or offer to make it better.  \n\nI think management needs some retraining on how to make someone's bad experience OK again.  We have learned our lesson this time and won't be back; which is a shame because we used to really love it there."
3;Not sure if it is because it is located within walking distance of where I live, the fact that its on the water, the free wifi, the delish coffee or the off-the hook ambiance, but this place has my heart!!  The place is located on Lakeside street which the area appears to be residential then there is this area of retail right in the middle. Super cool.\n\nCoffee in a mug-$2.23 \nThis is all I had on this visit but, will be back for the scones. There is an area set up with a couch, coffee table and book shelf where you can look directly out the window which overlooks Monona Bay.There are several tables out back on the deck and some tables outside in the front that face the street.  Every other Friday there is acoustic guitar and the bar serves wine and beer.  I have  yet to get down here and check it out. The coffee house is also open Wed-Sun (look up hours on website) evenings serving wine and beer. Summer Blush is only $4 a glass!!  Whoaaaa!!!\n\nIf you are taking a walk or bike ride around Monona Bay, this place is right on your way. Stop and take a break!!
1;The pho is alright. Seems like if you ask for a large they just give you more soup. Bad service. I had asked for a refill & the waiter cleaned two tables right in front of me & still didn't get me a refill. Asked again & cleaned three more tables & yet still didn't get me a refill. Ended up asking another waiter for a refill.
2;Thought I wrote a review before but maybe not.  Food very good. Drinks weak.  Tasty food but the prices are higher than you would expect  well, than what I expected   I'm not sure What you consider excessive.   But I just wouldn't go back because of price   Cave Creek is not where you think for oriental food, but we do have some other less expensive options in the area   I hope they read these reviews, because I see the running thread is price
0;If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns.
1;This place functions like a Chinese sit-down restaurants where all the items are meant to be shared. Almost all the menu items have a small (serves 2 people) and a large (serves 4 people). That's all and good, but it has an issue: it's a lie. \n\nMy buddy and I ordered a small pizza... But we both agreed that we could have eaten that small pizza by ourselves and be satisfied. A small item and a side is sufficient food for two adults. \n\nAnother issue is that it took an inordinate amount of time for a waiter to even service us.
3;I browse the app from time to time to see if there is anything new in my area (though doubt it) and get excited when something different pops up that proves me wrong. I see a Thai place and am intrigued and became even more excited seeing two people I trust (Dan and Amanda) reviewed it. Hopped into the car to try something new than the same ole' take out and fast food open late night. \n\nThis Thai food kitchen is integrated as part of Bailey's Bar which definitely is odd and not what you would expect. You sit at this typical divey bar except the menu has Thai. If you sit at the bar they have a bar menu of sorts with things like burgers mixed with the Thai, but ask for a full Thai menu. On the night we were there (Friday), it was bumping with karaoke which added more to the odd placement. The fact that the original owner of Komol is running this place make it even more bizarre, but a promise of some good food.\n\nWe both got Thai ice teas and at $1.25 this is the cheapest I've seen this drink being sold and it was good and not too sweet.\n\nPad Kee Mao with Pork - I think this was pretty good, decent flavor and perfect amount of spice. The pork was good quality and tender. \n\nTofu Panang - this is a far more fragrant panang than most places do, definitely like Komols. If you love keffir leaf/ lemongrass type flavor then you might highly enjoy its presence here. The serving was generous and the tofu was lightly fried on the outside but nice and silky inside. Definitely ate this up.\n\nServing sizes were more than generous as well for the price, we had some leftovers. It was $21ish for our meal for 2 drinks, 2 entrees, 1 extra rice. They do lunch specials until 3pm Mon- Fri as well, so you can get some noms on the cheap here. \n\nThe server was very friendly and attentive. Considering we were on the other side of the bar in a booth, I was apprehensive if we would be seen, but she anticipated our needs and made rounds to check on us. \n\nEating in a smokey bar not your thing? Take it to-go and they also do delivery! \n\nDefinitely a great addition to the NW as we don't have a Thai place abundance here, but excited it seems to be authentic and quality Thai at that. I think we will end up getting a lot of take out from here since it's on the way home. Highly pleased with my inaugural visit with the quality of food and can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
2;I've stayed at the Planet Hollywood twice now I give this place an honest review.\n\nRooms: Besides the fact that there was a HUGE wet spot on the floor of our room when we first entered...nothing special. The bathroom is large (which is nice for the ladies) and there's a tub to fill with ice and put your bottles of alcohol in. I know you do it...\nParking: SUPERRRR far from the actual hotel! UGH!!!!\nPool: HORRIBLE! So small and plain! Yuck. You need a room key to get in by the way.\nService: Sloowww! And for some reason they always seem to hang up on you or make you wait forever.\n\nWhen it comes to picking hotels in the summer I look for 2 things: Location & pool.\nPlanet Hollywood has a horrible pool so...next time I would skip this place.
0;I went to this place when it first opened and many times thereafter. I also enjoyed some of the best Irish food to be had in Vegas at Wooloughan.  I went back a few days ago and what a surprise, remember this is supposed to be an Irish Pub, but it was and is no longer such a place. The new place has the same decor but that is where it stops, \n     The menu had a total of 5 Irish dishes on it. The rest were plain bar food, hot dogs,hamburgers, and stuff like that. I ordered potato soup leek soup and got a thin soup with TexasToast !. Asked for soda bread and was told they don't serve that any more.  I ordered corned beef and cabbage and got chopped cabbage,fried in bacon grease and sliced deli corned beef that was over cooked. It WAS AWFUL. \n     If you want Irish food, DO NOT GO HERE.
0;The service is miserable. When I say miserable, I mean you could go ten minutes without seeing a single worker. I ate her lunch Saturday and Sunday since it was close to my room. The salad I had the first day, the strawberries were frozen. And it was a 17 dollar salad.  Dont waste your time.
4;ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Madison Farmer's Market!\nYou cannot leave without trying Stella's Spicy Cheese bread. I may not be the person to ask about produce considering I typical go there to by dairy, meat, bakery products. A recent find we had this past weekend was Carmel Corn Gelato!  It is a fun place to wonder around and have breakfast. If you want to get in and get out without a lot of people it is best to go in the morning if you have kids, strollers, walkers go after 9 am when the pace is more a leisurely walk and you aren't getting in the way of the people who want to get what they need and leave. \nEnjoy!
0;big platters of tasteless food.
0;"Horrible customer service! \n\nThe first time I stopped by, I picked up a couple items. I asked about a military discount. The cashier answered that they had one, but she'd have to re-ring me up and was too busy for that. \n\nThe last time I went there, I picked up two compression sacks, something I've been needing. Went up to the register and was told the items would not ring up. After 10 minutes of just standing, I was told that they didn't \""sell those items.\"" I was baffled, how could they have something in store, in a bin, that they didn't sell? I questioned it and was told the two items were supposed to be with sleeping bags and were not for sale on their own. I told the associate I had the exact same compression sack at home in yellow that I had bought from them, so I knew those items were sold separately and were sold at that store. The guy shrugged, apologized, and left me standing there.\n\nThe prices are fair and that's the only reason I think I even attempt to purchase items from there. Their customer service is horrible, though, and honestly makes me feel like paying more at REI is worth it."
3;Great food, awesome selections!
1;"My regular Togo place when I feel lazy at home, the food is great but make sure u check the order before u take it back home especially the busy hour! ;( they miss one of my main course n I need to go back n get it@@ no my idea lazy Togo day, I guess .."
2;I've been to the Henry three or four times already and even though the food is good (nothing too spectacular).. It is quite pricey for what you get. I do enjoy sitting on their beautiful patio but watch out for those bug bites. I left that place with 4 mosquito bites.\nNot sure if it will be my top pick on restaurants that I will revisit.. But we will see.
1;This place is beyond overrated.  I don't want to knock the service because that was very good (though I feel we were somewhat pushed to order more than was needed) but seriously, what a scam.  One dish was just bad. Pasta was fair and the fish was good but way to expensive (and why not bring the potatoes after they filet the fish so they are at least warm).  Bartolotta was too busy kissing the ass of the people who bought white truffles for 90 bucks a piece, and hanging with the truffle reps to care about what was going on in the kitchen. I wanted to say something to him but ultimately decided against it but am now regretting it.  I usually use Yelp to write about good meals that I've had.  Enough people complain about bad meals.  This was one situation that I felt I needed to share about.
2;Good food.  Good service.  Bad location.  Bad hoodlums in the strip mall where it is located.
2;Decent meal, nothing spectacular but not as horrible as everyone seems to be making it out to be. I would encourage everyone to at least give it a try. Anytime a new restaurant opens there are bound to be a few issues to work out. I had the fish and chips, hubby had the grilled chicken sandwich. Average Maricopa food.
3;A great place for all appetites.  With a full bar for the adult eaters.
3;Very friendly, very helpful and close to my home.  If they weren't jabbing me with needles every week I'd give them five stars.
0;Server did not know the menu,....45 mins to get our food , but the take out orders were going out within 15 mins.  Had the Hunan Chicken  it  had the consistency of Sushi.  Complained to owner...  his response... its cooked.  never saw or spoke to him again.  I guess he doesn't care about service.  I will say my wife liked her dinner\nThey need to improve their training of staff members and Owner need to care about his customers.\n I will not be back, I can understand me not liking the food but there is NO excuse for POOR service. If the Owner doesn't care why should his staff
0;My family and I ate lunch here for the first and last time. The beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup. The burros were alright but I've had much better. I hope that the AC was broken and that it's not always that hot inside. The service was pretty bad to, really slow. I'm giving them one star because the rice was good. I'd say find someplace else to eat.
4;Make sure you pull into this place caddy corner with a hunger for some real Mexican.  For real caddy corner, although illegal, use the pedestrian ramp  on the NW corner to launch into the parking lot.  Works best for leaving, when the place is packed. This place has some of the best tortillas, frijoles, chorizo and quesedillas in town.  The other Mexican joints are trying to do what Carolina's has been doing for years....  The only con is they aren't open on Sundays and that they could call in the amigos to renovate the place a bit....
4;Thanks to Yelp I found this little Thai place in a strip mall in Las Vegas.  It is some distance from the Strip, but it is worth the trip.  I have gone there both of the last two times I've visited Vegas.  Both times the food was inexpensive and delicious.  The woman who owns and runs the place keeps it spotlessly clean and is quite the character.  I highly recommend this place.
0;The hotdogs are okay, pricing isn't bad, but the guy that was serving me was a douche! I've been to places where the food was good enough to overlook the service... this isn't one of them!
0;I was on vacation at a cabin in WI with my boyfriend. We stopped in Madison for the day and stopped in at Espresso Royale to warm up and use the internet. I had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate I have ever had. It didn't even taste like chocolate. It was really light too. Maybe they forgot the chocolate? It tasted like nothing. Absolutely horrible. My boyfriend's latte was mediocre at best. I generally prefer to avoid the national coffee chains but in this case I really wish I had gone to Starbucks.
4;Love it! The older gent that runs the counter talks like some kind of cartoon character.  He is so sweet and welcoming.  Great food too! I will continue to make this a go to place for Japanese food.  Delicious!
0;"This is the last place you want to bring your car to be serviced. Disorganized, disinterested, and disrespectful was my direct consumer experience with \""Great Big Gaudin Ford\"". Simple battery change with diagnosis cost $250 and took two full days. Do not be deceived by their concept of \""appointment\"". There is no such thing. I was told Arrogantly \""don't call us we'll call you\"". This is like a joke that nobody laughed at when it was originally told...and keeps getting told over and over again...and still nobody is laughing because...it still isn't funny. You've been warned. Gaudin Ford doesn't care that you are a third generation Ford owner, that you've dutifully supported the dealership community or anything. Gaudin Ford doesn't know anything about you and couldn't care less.\n\nGaudin Ford gives Ford dealerships a bad name."
3;"Straight up looks like Matrix Reloaded in here!\n\nSeriously, if you're looking for a \""Vegas Nightclub\"" experience, then this is your place. It's intimate, the dance floor is packed and the drinks are overpriced. Everything you need to gawk at girls and go back to your hotel room with your bros saying things like, \""She was ugly anyway.\"""
4;Ribeye al conacac... The best ...!!
2;This is a 3.5 stars, rounded down to a 3. It's solid, down home brunch food that's done well. We came here over Father's Day Sunday, so it was very busy. Being that it was just my husband and myself, we didn't have to wait very long to get seated at all. I have a feeling that it's always pretty busy- the kind of food they serve appeals very much to the suburban crowd of North Phoenix.  \n\nI'm not sure where they used to be, but this is their new location. It's really nice, done in the style of modern lodge I guess. Lots of wood, but a bit sleeker. They have a full bar, so we were able to have beer and mimosas with our lunch, which I certainly appreciated! \n\nThe menu is solid, good and filling. Most anything you'd find at a Denny's you'd find here. I built my own omelette- an egg white omelette with peppers, spinach and chorizo. This was a winner- I've never had the option to add chorizo, and the spices in it made the omelette truly outstanding. They also have these giant, fluffy home made biscuits that are pretty awesome. It always comes with big dipping bowls of creamy gravy to dip into. It's a bit runnier than I'm used to with gravy, but it still tasted pretty wonderful. \n\nNot something you should go out of your way to check out, but if you're in the area do stop by. You probably won't be disappointed, as long as you don't set your expectations too high.
0;Again another Chinese restaurant that pre cooks their sweet and sour chicken and anything that is deep fried. The sauces on the food were mediocre and the meat was dry and overcooked because of the precooked nature of the food.
3;"Your first time here WILL be awkward. It's like being in elementary school and the teacher throwing you up to the front of the class for an impromptu speech on your favorite classmate... so many classmates, so many friends! i'm dying of choices!!!\n\""Where is the menu?\"" is a good place to start.\nafter the initial awkwardness of having too many choices and not enough time to choose, you begin to really appreciate having so much control over the flavor that is going into your pie. everything from feta to mozzarella, artichokes to avocado, rosemary to basil, you can create your pizza like you create your salads. You choose your crust and your toppings and it's all baked to perfection. \ni used to work next-door to this delectable option of lunch-time fun. the staff was certainly very friendly and the owner even more personable.\non days like today, i miss it."
2;Not a bad place overall.  No cover, nice setup, and not too crowded.\n\nEyecandy sits right in the middle of the casino and can best be thought of as two different places occupying adjacent spaces.  In one space, there is a simple lounge with plenty of good seating and a decent bar, pretty regular stuff.  In the other space is what appears to be a mini-club, although it was among one of the oddest dance spaces I've seen in Vegas.  For one, I was told (though I didn't actually see this) that there are sound booths where you can plug in your iPod and send music directly to the DJ.  That's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  I am told that the crowd seriously varies, so we must not have come on a good night (but seriously, we came on a Friday night, so if not then, then when?).  There is apparently absolutely no dress code whatsoever, and that's really a shame, because as a result of this, there were plenty of guys in shorts and sandals (with the obligatory women stuffed into cocktail dresses two sizes too small).  I'm usually one for relaxing dress codes all across the board, but I think Eyecandy took it a bit far.\n\nAgain, I've heard that experiences vary drastically depending on what night you happen to be coming by and that there really is no way to predict what experience you're going to get because there's no discernible pattern at this place.  I can at least say with some certainty that the lounge area will likely remain consistent, and for this place, that's a good thing.
4;This is definitely the best club I have ever been to and may arguably be the best club at Vegas.  Upon entry, the vibe, the music and the atmosphere simply meshed.  The crowd was A+ in my opinion.  I loved the outdoor pool area and the fact that there was a wading area  where you could get your freak on with the ladies.  I should have never danced in the pool area.  I LOST MY SHOES and I had to walk out barefoot.  Also to top things off, I didn't drink the entire night!  My night at XS made my Vegas trip the best ever!
4;Angie and Whitney were amazing!!! We got our makeup done for a night out in Vegas and could not be happier with the makeup and how sweet both Angie and Whitney were. We will definitely be calling them again the next time we are in vegas! Highly recommend them!
0;If I'm judging purely on value, it's a zero star.  The place is just super expensive, and you're paying for faux ambiance instead of quality.  \n\nAsk yourself - why am I going to this restaurant?\n\nIf your answer is food, try Smashburger.  If your answer is that you want sake-infused hockey pucks of beef, then sit down and enjoy your overpriced Grade D meat.
0;"So.....I knew not to expect much based on the area, but I figured I'd give it a chance. The room was fairly clean except there was a hair and some weird stain on the bed....lets organize this post a bit because there were a number of issues.\n\n1. Stain and hair on the bed...not a huge deal.\n2. When they came to clean, they didn't change the sheets.\n3. We were woken up by the gardeners on Saturday morning at 9am with the leaf blower.\n4. The maids were in the hall talking very loudly at 9am as well.\n5. As we left, the maids watched us the whole time as they \""kicked it\"" at the stair well. We felt so unwelcomed. \n\nI will never stay here again."
4;Best fucking park in baseball. Tickets are reasonably priced and the view is awesome of the downtown skyline. I try to go to visit other parks every year, and this was my first time to PNC. This is just an all around awesome park and it puts my Nationals Park to shame.
3;Second go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.\n\nThe restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.\n\nI was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99\n\nMy order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. \n\nThe only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!\n\nI'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well.
4;I went to Alex with dark brown, short, damaged, choppy hair. After one visit she took me the perfect shade of blonde and put in gorgeous extensions. She blended the hair perfectly that people don't even know my real length. She takes such good care of me as her client and I'm beyond grateful I found her!
2;I'm not sure why, but their barbeque sauce doesn't ring true for me.  There seems to be a slight watery tang there that shouldn't be..  So just 3 stars for me, but I LOVE their beans!  If I had my way, I'd get beans from there and get the meat from somewhere else..  :\\
1;I tried the pad thai here since that's what I always get to gauge a Thai restaurant.  The dish was slightly bland, a bit too sweet and not much else.  I did not taste any lime or cilantro, or really anything that reminded me of Pad Thai..  The price is the same as any other Thai restaurant, but I think I'd prefer any other Thai restaurant...
0;what the F*** is that smell. Have they ever cleaned this place?? \n\nDrink specials? who cares, If I gave you a free beer with dog crap rubbed all over the sides would you drink it?
3;They serve melted cheese on buttery bread and play roots reggae in the diner. I'm sold.\n\nThe place is small and casual but well designed with a cute vibe. The menu changes all the time but obviously consists mostly of variations on grilled cheese. Some funky ones I've tried include: burrito grilled cheese, pesto grilled cheese, and drumroll...poutine grilled cheese. \n\nSo if you're looking for a quick, casual meal or a naughty snack this side of Decarie, Le Cheese is the place to be.
4;Wow, what a hike! Like Camelback, Piestewa Peak is a workout! And like Camelback, it is as hard going down as it was going up.  The top provides a perfect 360 view of the Valley, but yesterday it was pretty smoggy, so seeing downtown was a tad hard. Even still, a great view.\nI found Piestewa to be much more peaceful at the top than Camelback...probably because there weren't a ton of people up there when we made it to the top. However, my peaceful thinking at the summit was interrupted by a man who decided this was the best time to make a speech about his best friend...who just happened to be Jesus.\n\nWe hiked the Summit Trail and while there were definitely a lot of people there since it was gorgeous out yesterday, it didn't feel as crowded as Camelback and there were times where it was just me and my husband. Close to the summit are handrails, which come in handy on the way down.  Parking was 100% better than Camelback...plenty of spots and the turnover was pretty quick at the lot at the Summit Trail trailhead. It looked like there were other lots nearby, so parking is not a chore like it is at Camelback.
2;"This place has a marquee sign on The Strip near the MGM Grand; next to the M&M Candy store. The actual theater is behind the Hard Rock Cafe`.\n\nIt's an old theater with a slanted floor and very wide screen. The projection and sound systems are very modern. \n\nTicket and consession prices are about what you would expect at a movie theater in a large, busy tourist town. It's a great alternative to gambling, drinking, and dancing.\n\nI'd come here again."
3;"Very nice accommodations. Centrally located to everything. Walls are a little thin. We heard the couple next in the room having some \""morning relations\"". Very clean and modern. Would stay here again. Helpful staff."
0;Over priced and disorganized!
2;Six guys without reservations on Cinco de Mayo FIght weekend looking for a good meal found this place pretty empty at around 7.30pm.  three of us joined up late and our waiter promptly took our drink orders and promptly forgot them.  after our drinks showed, we ordered the baked brie for around $11 and the crabcakes $9 i think.  the waiter was very pushy insisting that we orer multiples of every appetizer.  we ordered more beer.  my friend was so pissed that his was taking so long to show that he ordered two beers at once to make sure he would get at least one.\n  the filet mignon at $23 was reasonable but i asked for mine memdiim rare, and not a drop of blood came out of it.  the asparagus was cooked well, all six sprigs of it, and the mashed potatoes that were squeezed out of a pastry bag looked pretty but were too dry and lacked seasoning.\n  overall a bargain, but definitely felt like i was paying less for less, but then again, everything else was stocked, so it was better than starving.  we left and headed straight over to the SPEED ride to give our stomachs some excitement.
2;"I have a mixed opinion on this place.  I have ate here three times, with one YUM experience, one \""That was pretty good\"" and one \""eeeehhhhh\"" that was ok experience.\n\nThe salmon salad is DELICIOUS!  I would highly recommend it for a healthy option.  I also saw a few friends get it.  The only thing I will say is that the actual salmon portion has looked a little inconsistent.\n\nI got the Buffalo Chicken wrap with grilled chicken instead of fried.  It was pretty good, nothing special.  \n\nMy ehhhhhh dish was the Prime Rib sandwich.  I was really excited to try it, especially after my server spoke so highly of it, but I was disspointed.  I think the worst part was the bun it was served on.  It was what I'd consider a \""sandwich bun\"" you would get at a cafeteria, with weird seed things on it.\n\nGood drink specials....Bud Light for $2 and Bloody Mary bar with a million sauces and mixes for $3.  The upstairs patio is awesome!  Though doesn't compete with the new member of the neighborhood's Peculiar Rabbit."
1;"This 5th generation cattleman from Missouri finds himself not impressed with Lawry's The Prime Rib and their lunch offerings. Let's start from the top and work through the experience. \n\nParking: Ample for lunch, but for a 600 seat restaurant it would be a little tight during prime time hours. \n\nDecor. Their website claims an Art Deco appearance, but having spent a lot of time brushing up on Kansas City's Art Deco architecture which led me into a more expansive study or two, I'm not an \""expert\"" on Art Deco style but I'm not an amateur either. Count me among the people who are not impressed with this location's styling. It was ho-hum, and quite frankly I've seen and experienced better. \n\nService: Slow and not impressive. I ordered the Tuesday lunch special. I never received my chili that I ordered that was part of the special. Another person at our table ordered extra food at the end of our meal to take back to the office and it took an awful long time for it to arrive. Also I was not offered a refill on my iced tea either. That's something I shouldn't have to ask for, it simply needs to be taken care of, especially at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nFood: I liked the 4 bread choices. But quite frankly I was not impressed with their sides which lacked adequate seasonings and spices. And then there's the problem with the meat and where a Cardinal Sin was committed. I watched as it was carved in front of me. The appearance was good, I brought it back to the table looking forward to enjoying it. 3 bites in and I'm like this is so disappointing. It wasn't tender, and it lacked good flavor. For a minute I was wondering if they had run out of quality meat and had substituted Sysco's cheapest product line instead. I needed to eat so I took a few more bites as to not offend the people I was with, but it was extremely disappointing. For a place with a name that says THE PRIME RIB on the sign, that has 70 some odd years of providing food service, I was disappointed at the quality of food that ended up on my plate. The horseradish was a pleasant surprise though and the saving grace that allowed me to consume the sandwich and not leave with a growling stomach. \n\nVerdict: Not impressed. At all. I'm thankful I didn't have to foot the bill for this experience, and I'm glad I got to experience a Vegas \""legend\"" but Lawry's won't make my list of places I will have business lunches at, or take out of town guests to if I want to showcase the best of what Las Vegas has to offer. \n\n2 Stars. I'm sorry, but I can't be impressed when one of their signature items, one of the things they claim to do so well was so hard to consume and not enjoyable. I used the term Cardinal Sin...I chose my words carefully. \n\nBarring the unexpected I won't be back."
2;Stopped by tonight for dinner. On Tuesday's they have 3 dollar tacos. My wife had the tacos and dug 'em. That's a lot to say as we are pretty critical of our tacos. \n\nI took advantage of the $30 anniversary deal: ceprese salad, filet, chocolate  souffle. The steak was good, came on some potatoes and vegetable and topped with a bearnaise sauce. \n\nOverall, not too bad. We may eat there again, but it's kind of a drive and probably not good enough to pull us across town again.
3;I can vouch for the cheese curds, so wonderful when they are fresh, otherwise, much like other places' cheese curds, they become sluggy traps of oil and blah.\n\nI trudged through my Old Fashioned even though I am a beer dude. It was strong and packed a helluva punch, but totally worth it. I first thought it was a Wisconsinan sangria.\n\nEnjoyable.
3;Love, Love, Love Sierra Bonita Grill. Very unassuming restaurant at the Southeast Corner of 7th Street and Glendale Avenue. The food is incredible, with many dishes leaning towards the Southwestern and Mexican influences that are prevalent here in the Phoenix Metro Area. I personally can't live with out the Carne Asada Dinner. The skirt steak is seasoned and cooked to perfection, the traditional beans and rice are wonderful supports, and the fresh tortillas and guacamole make the dish a masterpiece. For appetizers, the spinach and oxaca cheese quesadilla is great, the hand-hacked guacamole and salsa that comes with fresh warm chips is a can't miss, and the margaritas are perfect. Sierra Bonita is owned by the same proprietor as Phoenix City Grill, and is a excellent complement to the Valley scene and the the 7th Street corridor.
2;So I was reading an online discussion board about the best sandwiches in Phoenix and this place was suggested a few times.  I figured since it was pretty close to my hotel I'd give it a try for dinner one night.  I ordered a Veggie New Yorker.  My first mistake was ordering it on plain sourdough bread...you need a heavy duty roll to stand up to the sauce and the cole slaw they put on there.  I thought my sandwich was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the type of sandwich I'd want to have all the time.  I got potato salad as my side and it was really bland, I wouldn't order it again.  I highly doubt these are the best sandwiches in Phoenix but at least there were a lot of options to choose from...the guy in front of me actually ordered a whole turkey leg!
1;Strange. I posted before about great blue berry cakes. Today 3 pancakes and maybe 10 blueberries in all. Sad.  I will try again but I will be cautious and reiterate what I want. Friendly  service but forgot lots of requests
2;Like most restaurants at the Biltmore Fashion Park (and malls in general), Sam's Cafe feels very corporate (and it is part of the Canyon Cafe chain), but don't let that hold you back here.  While there are better Southwestern places around, Sam's does a decent job with everything.\n\nI've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.\n\nJake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.  While the food quality is OK here, it's just that - average.
1;Short Sum: Inexpensive and overrated desserts. Small location with a long wait. No.\n\nPros: \n- Clean and pretty.\n\nCons: \n- Desserts were not worth it. $10 Ice Cream dish with 2 chocolate dipped strawberries? Not worth it. \n- Frozen hot chocolate for more than $10? Not worth it either.\n- I don't know why it felt really cramped. \n- Long wait.\n\nGo Back?\n- This review is solely on the desserts. I'll come back to try their food and maybe adjust my rating.
1;Bleh.  I do not like this location at all!  I normally don't have anything bad to say about AMC Theatres, but this one just makes me mad.  First of all, the bathrooms are terrible!  They are way too small and somehow manage to look like they're 30 years old!  I also hate the location of this one with all the awful chains around (not awful because they're chains, but awful because their food/product is awful).  The actual theatres are not the nicest and could use a bit more thorough cleaning after each show.  The seats are strangely small.  I feel like they ordered the wrong chairs for this one because they don't feel like any of the other AMC's that I've been to.  Last but not least, this theatre is entirely over-run by children.  They are everywhere and their parents don't seem to care how their screaming and whining bothers other people.  Ugh.  I won't come back unless I have to.
0;There was nothing I liked about this club. My friends and I came here after recieving wristbands in the Sugar Factory. We when we arrived  They seem to be a bit unorganized. Or the line is way long. Entrance and exit is by stairs. This seems lazy, but for those that are in heels and have been dancing the night away, an elevator or escalator would be nice. When I asked if there was an elevator, the guy told me for it's for handicapped. The place is tiny. The area they call the dance floor is packed with people. I've been here twice and never plan on going back again.
2;The food is good,a bit on the pricy side for just pasta. I wished they had revised there menu to make it more healthier overall. Very heavy on the calories, which makes me want to visit only once every few months.
1;Umm Arepas should be a couple of dollars at the most. A cheese Arepa is $5 bucks and add a plate of beans and rice and some Passionfruit juice we are now heading into the $12 territory. Lame..
3;Love love love their desserts! I can eat their desserts everyday if they weren't that pricey. I've tried their raspberry macaroon and carrot cake. They were absolutely TO DIE FOR. They were tasty yet still light. I'd definitely go back every now and then when I need a treat! Their coffee/latte are pretty pricey too, expect at least 4 bucks for a cup of hot latte. The only negative thing about this place is the staff aren't that friendly and for the price you pay for the desserts, I expect full service than self-serve.
1;The illy coffee when made correctly is to die for! But the croissants at $5.00 a piece, W O W!!!! The quality of the coffee beverage that you order can differ from day to day based on who makes it, so I have to reduce my rating of them by a few b/c of the cups of coffee with little to no flavor in them that I received. \nLiked: Service, Atmosphere, Decor Disliked: Food, Value
2;3/5/11\nTried the apple fritter and bear claw and 4 donut holes for $3...not sure if that was considered a good deal...10 cents per donut hole so that made each donut $1.30 considering i don't usually do donuts but with all the reviews we tried it! they were good...don't really have anything to compare them to as we don't really eat many donuts...\n\nnext time we'll have to come in the morning and see if there's a difference? We had no idea some of them were vegan until after we left! no signage on any of them...
2;Just another reason why I love the Aria (#1 reason- that vanilla smell!  Supposedly it's an aphrodisiac).  Julian Serrano's atmosphere is great- I wish I had taken a picture of the pretty trees all around the restaurant.  \n\nAnd boy do I love tapas. Here's what we got (or at least what I remember)\n\nAhi Tuna Tempura with avo & mango salad and wasabi foam: The foam was a little strange to me but the ahi was delicious!\n\nGrilled Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ Eggplant and mushroom demi: MM.  Possibly my favorite.  Super tender and the eggplant was bomb!\n\nSalmon with Truffle:  Okay, wait, this one was my favorite.  The truffle sauce was a revelation... HAHA.\n\nTuna Cones: Hm, not bad...but I preferred the tuna tempura.\n\nChicken Chilindron: Pretty good, I didn't really like the combo of tomatoes, chicken and ham initially but after a few bites really warmed up to it.\n\nPan Manchego: Oh man, I may have to change my mind yet again because this was so freaking good.  Evolved bruschetta.\n\nThe server didn't know if bread was free or not, but gave it to us anyway and later found out it wasn't (but didn't charge us, win!).  Basically consumed my body weight in free bread, because man those tiny plates are hard on the wallet.
4;"I am finally getting around to reviewing Crudo.  What a great experience! We did the full tasting menu and were impressed by every dish.  Our server was amazing and passionate about every dish. The crudo dishes were my favorite - the albacore with black garlic and truffle was RIDICULOUS!  I'm still craving it!\n\nI told our server how impressed we were and what talent the chef had...and jokingly I said, \""Is the chef  single?\""  We laughed our butts off when she said, \""well, he's actually my husband\""    I absolutely love the husband wife team making Crudo such a success.  You can taste the passion in their food.  Well done Chef Cullen and the entire team.  I wish you much success!!"
0;"Decor/Ambience: It's quaint and we were hoping that we'd stumbled upon a cute little gem of a restaurant on the first day of our trip. Upon entering the restaurant it was odd as it took awhile for us finally to be acknowledged by anyone and then once we were actually seated we picked up on the odd vibe. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no music and the overall feel of the dining space is awkward as all conversations can be heard. There were numerous moments where a noticeable silence took over and I felt I could hear the people next to me chewing (or maybe I was just that hungry)!\n\nService: AWFUL!!! Our waitress seemed very sweet, but it was obvious her attention was elsewhere. We were seated and it took a good 15 minutes for our order to be taken. It then took another 10 minutes for us to finally see a glass of water. We found ourselves deep in conversation and then realized another 20 minutes had gone by and our waitress was MIA and no appetizers were in sight. Although another waiter passed by our table a few times and even cleaned the nearby table no one seemed to notice or care that we were left totally abandoned.  We figured we'd give it another 5-10 minutes before we gave up, but could not even spot our waitress during that time. \n\nFood: While I see other reviews describe the food as \""disappointing\"" I cannot even comment on the bread because after waiting for nearly one hour we did not even see a simple bread basket! We finally reached the point where we just walked out and left since the waiters were all MIA and from what we could see from the one table that had food next to us, it did not look to be worth an hour wait. \n\nNeeds overall improvement!"
1;Disappointing. Walked in around 2pm for a late lunch and drinks on a Saturday. No one was working the bar. The food was ok. Not great. I thought it was expensive too compared to other Mexican places in the area. And an extra $1.50 for using a credit card? Probably won't come back. And never got my drink.
0;Over rated.. Bad service and expensive food. I ordered shrimp on linguine and it was dry, under cooked and not tasty. Serving size is small even for dinner. Price is high, and not even delicious which makes it not worth it. There are many other good restaurants in Venetian / Plazzo, try others but not B&B.
2;The staff is nice, big portions and food is good, but not great.
0;Absolutely the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen, worse than a 29 Palms roadside gas station. Every time I dine there I bring up the dirtiness of the facility and every time I return (hoping thay have rectified the situation) the bathroom seems the same.\n\nThe only saving grace is the excellent food (especially the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast)  and waitstaff in the restaraunt, if not for that reason I would never step foot in there.
2;Open 24 hours and in the middle of the strip! I really didnt have high expectations for this place coming in at 3 am. The menu is expensive due to it being on the strip. I order bulgogi and beef brisket to share amongst friends. She first brought out sides, fish cake was not one of the sides for the day which just ruined my whole experience entirely... (lol/jk) But since we only ordered two types of meat it only came with two bowls of rice, so i had to pay extra. It wasn't served with lettuce or salad, it cost $5 more. This was the type of place that you just had to pay extra for anything extra. I guess I was expecting all you can eat type places that I'm more use to. Other than that, the meat portions was plentiful. \n\nThe server started off fairly rude to us and after a while she finally warmed up but it was already to late to leave a good tip :(
1;"How this place has 4 stars I do not understand. I can totally get into a \""mom and pop\"" style breakfast place, but Three Sisters is just plain dirty. The carpet is filthy, booths are tearing, and the place is just lacking in basic upkeep. \n\nNow to the food: it's not the worst I've ever had, but a far cry from the best. I had the 2, 2, 2, 2 (eggs with 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and 2 pancakes). The eggs were cooked well and the sausage links were actually very good. But the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy. The pancakes were pretty tasty, though. My boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things. His eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again, soggy. The toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast?\n\nService was super slow. I think it took 40 minutes for us to get our food which is outrageous. The food was also kind of pricey for what you get. Our meal was $18 and probably should have cost around $12. Not to mention the surprise that they don't take credit cards. There aren't any signs posted anywhere that they only accept cash, they don't even post it on the menu. Plus the closest place to grab some cash is to walk down to the PDQ and use their ATM, absolutely ridiculous! I definitely won't be returning anytime soon."
0;$6.99 steak & Eggs graveyard special. I Know why it's that price. worst steak ever . had 2 bites and my jaw was sore from chewing. eggs were OK.  Bread choices were limited to white or wheat. spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere . but Idid love watching  the drunk wasteoides from drai's eating there at 5 am
3;These guys are a great little hideout of fresh ingredients in a Mario Batali warehouse.  It's like Foodie Fight Club, only you should totally tell everyone about it!    For great condition organic veggies and fruit -- at a good price -- this is the place to go.  There's also a bread vendor who sells amazingly delicious Rye for $4 a loaf -- if you miss out on this, you'll be bereft of some good sandwiches!  \n\nIf you're looking for where all the top chefs get quality niche ingredients, this is the spot.  Make sure you get there Thursdays!
0;Stopped in the lube shop for an oil change. Walked inside and was shocked how dirty the place was. The bathroom reminded me of a prison movie, filthy doesn't describe its disgusting condition. I figured the oil change is quick so just deal with it. While waiting I started thinking while listening to the staff yelling and joking that the inmates taken over the jail. Bad feeling was growing. They pulled car out, said all done, paid and left. Drove across town for a meeting, got out and oil was pouring out under the car. What a pain in the neck. Took to the nearest store that was clean, staff fixed with no trouble.\nUsually these guys are great but this location will never be a stop for me again.
1;"I've heard good things about Tuesday Mornings so I decided to give it a try. \n\nIt felt like a smaller cramped version of Last Chance with more housewares than clothing. And I am not a fan of Last Chance.\n\nI was really hoping to like this store....but nothing thrilled me at all. A lot of stuff seemed damaged and the prices weren't all that great. Don't know if I'm just cheap or don't shop at high-end stores that much but when I look at a price tag and actually utter the phrase, \""THAT'S a clearance price?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"", it isn't good.\n\nProbably won't be heading back. \n\n(Is the problem that I went on a Friday afternoon instead of a Tuesday morning?) (Just asking.....)"
2;Solid 3 1/2 stars.  Sashimi was super fresh.  All the cooked foods were not bad either.
4;I had one of the top 5 meals I ever had at Bouchon. Everything I tried was excellent. I even tried things I would never think of ordering (I went with a group so we shared a few starters) and even they amazing. Geat food. Try the pork belly for starters.
1;I'm not an Alice Cooper fan, but was brought to Alice cooper'stown by a group of coworkers.  We were greeted by a host who was definitely dressed the part, as were all the waitresses.  The restaurant is fairly dark and dingy inside despite the lovely Phoenix sun that could be shining in from the outdoors.   \n\nThe service was really slow, and it took a long time between when we ordered and when the food arrived.  I chose the fish tacos, and the fish was overly deep fried, and tasted a but like everything that had been in the fryer.  I didn't really enjoy them at all.\n\nA few people at my table got the brisket, and comments were made about how dry it was, and how it lacked flavour that should be expected of brisket.\n\nIs restaurant seems like it is really gimmicky, however, I'm sure Alice Cooper fans probably appreciate it!
1;"Food is great! BUT... customer service is about the worst I have ever seen. I immediately thought of a skit on The Chappelle Show called \""Pop Copy\"" (YouTube it!). It was like they were frustrated that I interrupted whatever what ever they had going on to give them some business. What is unfortunate is I punish myself by going back again and again because their chicken is so good. There is never a greeting, a thank you, a please come again or anything positive. Even when I pull up to the drive through window I receive a look of disgust, like \""why are you bothering me\"". Chicken Kings food will only take them so far, at some point I am not going to find their negative attitude humorous."
1;"They have a lot of things you need but let me tell you why my review is so low. I'm a college student, I was up late one night studying and then I went over for some snacks and an energy drink. So they made me wait for ten minutes because of the computers or something like that. There was about 8 other people behind me waiting during those ten minutes and then finally a lady came over so we could get the line moving. She took her sweet time AND she answered her cell phone during the check out! I was so angry because it was rude when we were all wanting to leave. It wasn't an emergency call just a \""hey how ya doin\"" call! I must say I have never wanted to not go back to a store as bad as this. They got two stars because they have good food."
1;Went here tonight. I bought an ocean blue goblet. It was decent definitely not worth the $36 dollars. Decent place, just extremely pricey.
3;A group of 7 of us dined at Bottega on a Saturday night. \n\nOur table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we waited at the bar. As an apology for the wait, we were each given a complimentary glass of wine. A+ on the customer service!\n\nAs an entree, we had calamari, served with lemon.  They were perfectly cooked - the texture was great, but the oil used tasted very mildly burnt. \n\nThe star is the pizza! The margherita and capricciosa were delicious! The crust is thin, crispy on the outside and chewy in the center - amazing. The sauce is simple and clean, and has a rich tomato flavour.  And the cheese .. mmm.
3;"As usual, I'll dissent a little!  I like this place a lot.  My friend and I have started making this our usual pre-Suns-game stop, and I expect that tradition will continue into baseball season, as well.\n\nI think the pizza has been quite good the two times we've been there.  Granted, I am not at all pretentious about pizza, and think Pizzeria Bianco is a bit of a snobby joke with a great marketing plan.  So give me a big greasy, pepperoni-covered slice that I can fold in half and I am good to go.  \n\nThe beer (Mich Ultra or Bud Light only) is $10 a pitcher.  How can you go wrong, especially with the beer prices at US Airways or Chase Field?  Granted, it's not high-end craft beer, but it's TEN BLOODY DOLLARS.  Hell, bring me two!\n\nI like the owner, in contrast to some of the other comments.  The guy cracks me up.  Some folks came in and breezed right by the \""Order Here\"" sign and started yapping at him.  He walked over to the sign, flicked it with his finger and said, \""Sign says order here.\""  Excellent!  And when he closed just prior to the Suns game, some people snuck in and ordered, then tried to haggle on the price since it was closing time.  Owner says, \""Hey, I'm already feeding ya after closing time.  Now ya want a deal, too?\""  I love this guy!\n\nAnyway, I think this is a fun place with some personality.  Great place to grab a slice or two and a pitcher before a game.  You pizza connoisseurs can wait three hours for a pie at Bianco.  I shall wait for you at Brooklyn with a full stomach and second pitcher, as I blissfully watch the sports fans go by."
0;I went once before...it was cold and guess what I guess they don't know what fire is. Because the eggs was served to me cold yet again. And I got up and walked out. I wont pay for bad service nor will I pay for cold food. Don't go to this location. EVER...and if you do remember I told you the eggs would be stone cold :(
3;The lobster roll was so yummy I actually finished the whole thing! Had a bite of the sliders my girlfriend ordered and it was also very tasty.  My fianc\u00e9 ordered the prime beef, he didn't enjoy it as much as he has hoped.. It was a little bland and chewy. Standard quality cocktails, nothing to write home about. Overall satisfactory dining experience.
1;Came here awhile back and haven't gotten around to writing a review till now. I was NOT a fan. Moment i walked in I stood there for awhile feeling like an idiot cause no one greeted me or showed me where to sit. My boyfriend and I eventually just picked a spot and waited for a server to flag down. Eventually an older gentleman with an accent came up to us and gave us menus. I ordered a pitcher of white sangria. It wasn't bad but it wasn't very good either. To be honest, the food was completely un-memorable that I forgot everything we had ordered. I just remember being excited for the bacon wrapped dates because I love them over at Firefly. Well it was not like Firefly's dates. They were soggy and incredibly salty. The server also never came back again and when he eventually did come around to give us our check, it looked like he was in the middle of eating something. I quickly paid and got the hell out of there. I haven't been back since and I probably never will. If they fixed their customer service and cleaned up their dishes a bit, they could probably do well. I guess I'll never know.
1;"Is RA Sushi owned by a white guy?\n\nFOOD: If your looking for authentic Asian flavor, you're on the wrong end of Spring Mountain. RA is a fancified, Americanized Japanese restaurant. And no, fancified is not a real word. Every time I come here, I'm surrounded by modern california rolls that look like Bobby Flay threw up on them. I usually order nigiri during happy hour. Fish quality isn't that great --just saying.\n\nRA \""CHIPS & SALSA: GOOD! Basically tuna tar tar and its surprisingly good.\nSPICY CHICKEN YAKISOBA: soggy udon noodles, not spicy\nEDAMAME: some days they're hot, some days they're cold\nNIGIRI: not the freshest, fish to rice ratio bites\nROLLS: lots of mayo, creamcheese, or some strange salsa thrown on it\n\nDRINKS: Full bar. Happy Hour specials for Sake & Beer (for sake bombs) is a good deal!\n\nSERVICE: BAD FOR GROUPS! The only time I'm here is for group functions. The servers are easily confused. They always run out of shot glasses for sake bombs. They forget to refill waters and drinks.\n\nSPLITTING CHECKS: For large groups, our server made a check for every 3-4 people. Not too difficult. However, for groups over 6 people, gratuity is automatically calculated 20% each check. This is WAY TOO MUCH for these incompetent servers.\n\nFood isn't bad. Its just not the type of Japanese I'm used to eating. Think 'real' Mexican food in comparison to Taco Bell. My non-asian friends like it here. My asian friends do not."
0;We went to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress brought out a piece of chocolate cake for him at the end of dinner. It was completely unprompted so we thought it was complimentary, until we realized she charged us for it on our bill... Who does that?
1;The manager, a man, was very kind. The staff could not accommodate a simple v design for my nails saying they could only do it in gel.  That it would take too much time... after I had already made an appointment and was 30 min early. The nail tech didn't speak to me at all. Very cold and aluff  feeling. The work was good, but I asked on the phone to have nail art. Not impressed at all! Not happy at all. I was referred to bond first,  and I should have gone there.
4;If god was to open the heavens and deliver us a fast food joint right  in the heart of the city then this place is it .. let me reiterate if your on yelp and your looking for a place to fill your gullet with the best tasting fast food ever then this place it is .. again 1 more time STOP SEARCHING AND EAT HERE.
3;I really liked the wide selection of beers that they offered! However I do think they need more seating for busier nights!
3;We stopped in on a Saturday night after seeing the sign.  We were going to grab some sushi but hadn't noticed Ca\u00f1a before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas.\n\nLots of small plates meant to be shared.  We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks.\n\nDrinks were great.  Food was excellent.  However, the ceviche isn't really ceviche if that's what you're looking for.  The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing.  Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.\n\nService is good.  Definitely a good place for groups.  It's rather noisy so be warned.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios.
2;It was close to 10pm midweek in Vegas and we were both starving and desperately needing something for dinner. We walked past this restaurant and decided to give it a shot. The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them. When we got our entrees I dug into the bbq chicken pizza which was good but nothing outstanding. J's excitement about the red snapper quickly faded when he realized it was completely raw on the inside. We notified the server and he quickly whisked it away to get a new piece of fish cooked. About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish. It was a really nice touch by our server because he truly did seem frustrated for us with how messed up the fish kept being. I want to try this place again next time we are in Vegas because the service was top notch, but hopefully the food will be more consistent next time
1;Not a fan-the prime rib burger was good but most of the burgers are just awful. This location is unique as it has a Green Burrito in it too so you can get a taco salad some burittos or whatever floats your boat. I like the taco salad but havent eaten here in years.
1;This place has no idea about what it wants to be.\n\nIt advertises itself as mens clothing, but there is plenty of girls clothing too. The styles in OBC have  no coherance at all, they are all over the place - one minute you can be looking at emo/indie style tshirts and jeans, then two steps to your left you can be looking at sparkly ball gowns and the like. Really odd.\n\nI think the main compalint I have however is how expensive this place can be - you are much better off going to Princes Street.
0;This place sucks! Been there a few times and it has sucked every time. Wait staff is rude and slow. Food quality is poor. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
2;"My newly wedded wife and I were really looking forward to enjoying a great meal at Craftsteak.  We are both fans of Tom Colicho on Top Chef and it was going to be a treat.  However, we were quite a bit disappointed.\n\nThe restaurant itself was very nice and had a great ambiance.  I loved the decoration and the way the restaurant was laid out.  It had a very open floor plan but was very quiet.  The tables and chairs were awesome!  \n\nWe had the fall tasting menu for $75/person which consisted of the hanger steak, the wagyu steak, and the scallops.  The presentation of the dishes were in very nice looking skillets and the steaks and the scallops looked absolutely delicious.  However, when we started tasting it, I have to admit that the best dish was not the wagyu steak but the hanger steak.  The wagyu steak was cold and chewy.  I had expected a \""melt in your mouth\"" sensation but didn't get any of that.\n\nAll the other dishes were great.  The appetizers were very good and the desserts were very good as well.  However, their signature steak dish really disappointed me.\n\nThe main reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars was really the service.  When we were first seated, we got great service.  Our water was never empty and our server was very attentive.  About 1 hour into our dinner, 2 large groups came and sat down in the tables next to ours.  From that point on, I could not get anybody's attention and had to consistently ask for water or service.  That was very disappointing for such a top rated restaurant.  Incidentally, I felt that I got better service at the Burger Bar at Mandalay bay."
2;Not going to lie, not big on Thai or Chinese food, but I was with others who chose the place and tagged along. I am always good with fried rice, love that stuff, but this kind was not great. The chicken was dry, no egg in it really, and overloaded with onions and scallions that those flavors just kind of took over. \n\nOthers may enjoy, but if you like fried rice do not waste your taste buds on this one. \n\nIn the end the service was good. The family there was really nice and thoughtful and they do have specials, happy hour, and I guess karaoke on some night of the week. \n\nNever hurts to try.
0;Horrible experience.  The cashiers looked like they were miserable, which made me miserable.  When we told them that we ordered an iced coffee rather than a hot one, she just dumped the drink in the trash and proceeded to make a new one without saying a word.  HORRIBLE!
3;Sweet potato tots are great. Burger was good as well.
1;This was uhm... interesting. We had friends come down to visit us from Michigan and we were looking for someplace decent to eat and planned on going to a strip club afterwards... went to tix4tonight and came across Treasures-50% entrees, free admission to stripclub, and free limo! We figure sure why not! its everything in one, plus a free limo! The restaurant and strip club were in one building, but the restaurant part took over half of the building and the stripclub was in the other half.The food was alright, but it was weird trying to eat, and strippers kept walking by to get to the table behind us (im assuming a bachelor party maybe?) I dont exactly enjoy eating with naked ladies in my presence haha but hey, I guess some guys enjoy that. No regrets though, it was an interesting experience. checked out the stripclub for a little bit after food, but it wasnt that great at all. We left pretty quick.
2;We had purchased one of the all day any buffet deals and were out trying a good number of them over 24 hours.  They charged us an additional fee to eat with them which I wasn't happy with.  The food was good and we enjoyed some different choices than you see other places.  Now were super friendly and people persons but it didn't matter here as the servers were not friendly.  From the register, to the hostess and server not many smiled or even cared to talk and the place was not busy.  Drink refills are not dependable even though they walk by or collect dirty plates.  For the food I give three stars but not the service.  My tip reflected my dissatisfaction with the service received and we normally leave good tips where we eat.
4;Amazing. Amazing Amazning. \n\nI have been here 3 times and each time has been stellar! I have had the filet, the sea bass and the flank steak and all were just delicious. The wood fired grill really gives the steaks a unique flavor. The mushrooms....just to die for.\n\nThe best and most amazing part (if you ask me) are the frits you get (for free) as starters. They all have individual dips too. Nom nom. \n\nThe service is impeccable as well. I have a background as a waitress, so I always like to see how the waiters take orders, etc. I don't get to say this too often, but they were on point. \n\nThe martinis are made to perfection. The restaurant's ambiance is gorgeous and of course it's in Vegas, which is our favorite vacation destination spot!
0;"Customer service is ridiculous!!' Found a strand of hair in their dosa, and the guy said \""since you've already eaten it, I'm sorry, I cannot do anything!\"" Never visiting this place again!!!"
0;"Extremely poor customer service. Received a phone call from them stating my balance was being sent to collections. After reviewing my financial records, I am not disputing the amount owed. I had credit card fraud a few months back. The account was set to auto pay each month. After getting a new card, I did not set up my auto pay again. Totally my bad. However, I was not contacted once by the gym or the company they outsource their receivables to.  I then suddenly get a call saying my balance has been sent to collections. \n\nI went to the gym to speak to a manager. The front desk person asks me to take a seat, it might be a while.  She made no attempt to call a manager over. I then walked up to another staff member, the training manager, to explain my situation.  She gives me conflicting information - first she says we tried to call you but then states that a 3rd party handles their collections so they would be the ones to call.  Which one is it?? \n\nI then get passed off to a membership manager. Same contradictory garbage.  Then she finishes with \""well what do you want me to do about it\"".  At least some semblance of effort would have been nice to reach out to the collection agency and perhaps ask if I could just settle my payment at the gym right away.  \n\nOn my way out, I am given a collection agency phone number.  I call the number and it is a non working phone number!!  So I called the gym back to let them know and they state it is the only number that they had.  They tell me I should go on the Golds Gym website to find the number. The only problem with that is that the gym is franchise owned, not corporate owned. So the only people who know what collection agency they use is the local gym.   After being placed on hold for several minutes, they are able to tell me the name of the collection agency they use and suggest I google it to find the number.  \n\nI'll be researching debt collection laws as I have a pretty good hunch they cant send you to collections without first contacting you.  If I'm right I will definitely be filing a complaint with BBB, the FTC and whomever else I can."
1;I was disappointed that the flavor selection was the same as last week
4;great place, great vibes
4;This first experience has been fantastic. My brother received a FREE large one-topping pizza for his bday. Be sure to come at 4:45 for your pizza from a freshly stoked oven. Perfectly cooked with fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce. The Caesar and caprese salads were a great starter. We'll be returning for the great pie! Don't forget the tiramisu.
0;Food is good for a Buffet, service was good. Great place to go if you want to get ripped off. Went for lunch (lunch until 3:30pm then diner rate which is $3.00 more) arrived at 3:05 pm left at 3:52pm was charged diner rate, most places you go if you arrived at lunch time that is what you are charged for. Used a 15% off coupon which they took but did not deduct . The most interesting thing is that the receipt was time printed 4:46pm almost an hour after I left. Needless to say I won't go Back there, and will not recommend this place to anyone, If this review help anyone to avoid this place good if it helps in putting this place out of business great!
3;Beautiful salon with a wonderful owner who made planning a fun Bachelorette celebration really easy and enjoyable. For a reasonable cost per person, we were able to close the salon to just our private party of seven where three stylists got to work while we had champagne and crudite all ready and set up for us to enjoy. (They even decorated with some special Bachelorette signs and balloons).\nThe bride-to-be loved it all and while the degree of everyone's satisfaction with the actual blowouts/styles were all over the spectrum, the overall experience was really nice.
3;This... Was an interesting forced upon find... Like... They found me. Literally.\n\nI was minding my own business at work when an email came through from the big bosses that this food truck would be in the parking lot. Apparently they'd demanded their presence. And then every employee in my call center, including my boss, began chattering all excitedly like Gollum to his precious about the noms to be found inside this obnoxious colored food truck,.\n\nI was intrigued.\n\nI was even more intrigued and skeptical when I learned this was a truck that only served grilled cheese.\n\nAnd then I learned more... Like... They're not your average cheese and soggy bread sammiches!\n\nI ordered, at my boss' behest, the Cheesey Mac N' Rib with BBQ pork and tots.\n\nThis should be illegal. It's to die for, and their bacon mayo:? Equally heinous and just... wrong. Food truck food should NOT taste this good. Ever. My skepticism was shattered.\n\nOnly complaint? It took 20 minutes for my order to be up. My break is an hour long... That was precious facebook time wasted so I'll remove a star, but other than that? Holy God. Please come back!
0;"not very knowledgeable. . . came in for an inline 15 amp fuse and holder . . . The dude couldn't find a 15 but suggested his 30 would be fine!! Might as well have connected the wires and waited for something to melt ;-)"
0;This place has changed! When I first moved here this place was great! Not so much anymore.. Waited 15 mins for our waitress to even come over to us (& it was NOT busy!) we ordered our food & she quickly hurried off.. Waited another 30 mins for our food.. Which when was brought over I had a big pile of guacamole onto of my food when I just explained to her not to put it on ( highly allergic!) .. She laughed and said sucks that it's guacamole & you can't just scrape it off.. \n\nFood was still amazing, but the service just put a bad taste in my mouth!
1;"While the atmosphere is nice and the decor is comprised of stuff I'd like to see in my own home, the food is greatly over rated (and over priced) here. The enchiladas were sub-par and the tacos \""were the worst I'd ever had\"" according to my boyfriend's review of the pork tacos (and he's a man who knows his pork tacos). For about $17 (including tip) you can get one margarita (I've had better) and somewhat crappy Mexican food. Ouch. I will say their appetizer size spare rib Chile taquitos were alright, but they were not a full meal nor were they worth the nine dollars we spent on them. Wonderful, attentive service though so bravo to the staff!"
4;"Holy mother of Pearl! Where have you been all my life, True Rest?\n\nI was taken here by a friend as \""payment\"" for house sitting for him a few weeks ago. Honestly, I thought the whole idea of floating in a saltwater bath was pretty hokey (this guy tends to be a little out there, if you're catching what I'm throwing) so I didn't expect to have a life-altering experience. Much to my surprise, I was completely amazed. After an orientation, completing a form (which included a notice of a $500 fee if you defecated in the water!) and watching a short video, I was off to my private room to shower and soak. The silent and dark, with the lid closed, option sounded like the best way to fully immerse myself into this experience. Here's what I discovered: We all float down here, including me; weightlessness feels great and relaxing; I carry a LOT of tension between my shoulder blades; this water burns your eyes; after 48 minutes in this environment, I become anxious; I'll be going back again.\n\nMy friend Keith said I'd probably sleep better than ever that night, which wasn't the case. While my body was completely relaxed, my mind was fully ignited. I could probably have invented Post-Its if I focused on that. But I did remain physically at peace for several days thereafter. The Noob-Kit all first-timers receive includes a packet of Epsom salt so you can attempt to recreate the experience at home (I haven't tried this yet). True Rest offers packages for monthly floats."
0;My friend warned me about Spirit Airlines. It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\n\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \n\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\n\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \n\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \n\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US. I just hope they look into replacing their airplane engines if they are honestly the fastest growing airline.
3;Great little hang out spot. Full bar, excellent coffee & tea, and great food. Definitely trendy. Good location, right off the light rail. If you're in the phoenix area and in the mood for something different, it's worth it!
0;"First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12:40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied \""What\"" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there."
3;We stopped by Wolfgang after walking out of another place.  We were glad we chooses Wolfgang.  Great service, excellent food.  Good call before the show we were going to see later that night
3;Convenient and small looking place for a quick bite. Come in hungry and leave satisfied. Great place for meat lovers. Highly recommended if your walking around Edinburg castle.
0;Even thinking about this place gives me a stomach ache.\nWhere to begin, The atmosphere was fine, I liked the cheesy music on the outdated televisions, but thats about it . At first their whole hospital themed gimmick was cute then just got hugely annoying. The waitress was completely unattentive and even rude. There is NO WATER, which you will be begging for after a bite of their sodium packed but tasteless food. After a bite of their soggy flavorless food and too thick and rich chocolate shake I was ready to leave. I am a HUGE fan of anything that tacky and greasy food. But all their butter filled ingredients were all gratitious and adds nothing to the flavor of  the food. I have a stomach of steel and this place left me with an upset stomach. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4;I'm a BBQ lover and Mac's is top notch! We got the 4 meats 4 sides platter and it was amazing! Everything was cooked to perfection and the assortment of sauces was great for the a variety of tastes!
2;The hotel itself is beautiful! The rooms are also very nice. The Villas are OUT OF SIGHT amazing. I was at a bondage party here in 2010 after the last night of the AVN Awards.\n\nFew things here.. Security at the elevators is very tight 24/7. It's nearly impossible for a girl to even charisma check her way past them. You WILL need to rendezvous with your provider somewhere on the grounds.\n\nAlso the Valet is a total cluster as it runs into the palazzo and meanders under bridges and around faux-venetian canals. \n\nPlease note the 3-Star rating is based solely on a man's ability to enjoy himself with a consenting adult who is not staying in the hotel, not on the merits of the hotel itself which is, truthfully, breath-taking.
3;OH! Such a cute place with delicious bagels! The Montreal bagel is quite different from the New York bagel I've known all my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bagel sandwich combos are delicious with a very reasonable price point to match. I wouldn't buy the cream cheese or other items in their fridge -- that is rather overpriced. However, when buying just bagels, it is extremely well priced, particularly when considering the taste!\n\nJust be sure to bring cash -- they don't take credit.
1;We went to the KFC on Chandler Blvd. & the I-101 to get the 8 piece Family meal $19.99 + .99 (10 piece tender bites on special) for our visit to my 96 yr. old mother in law on Sunday.\nShe loves KFC! \nI was quite disappointed in the price to quantity ratio. All 8 pieces of chicken fit in the same size box as the 4 piece biscuit box. The 3 chicken legs and 2 thighs looked the same size as wing drumettes. The 2 wings would not keep a sparrow aloft. The breast, although a little larger, was dry. The 10 piece Tender bites were also dry and the crust had come off in the cooking process. The sides were ok. Cole slaw, 4 dry biscuits, potatoes and gravy. I could have consumed all the chicken myself and still have room for sides and dessert and I'm not a heavy eater. \nI have visited many KFC's and they are all the same. It's not just this location. \nAbsolutely NOT worth the $21.00+tax for me but worth every penny for the smile on my mother in law's face! :-)
4;This was my first Cici's experience - and for the record, I loved it!\n\nFor $5, you get all-you-can-eat pizza, soup, salad, and dessert.  The quality isn't top-notch, but everything still tasted great, there was an excellent variety of pizzas (they even make them made-to-order), and the service was outstanding.  I would absolutely return!
3;I love this library. It just keeps getting better. I was actually pretty sad about 5 years ago when the county decided to do budget cut on library hours. This location has the most friendly staff I know of. Amazing selection of book, this location and the downtown location has the best selection out of all the Mecklenburg library branches. \n\nThe kids area has bean bag chairs, play stations, sofas and computers set up to play kids games. I was one of those who relied on the amazing kids CD  games they have here to satisfy my imagination when I was younger haha.\n\nThe upstairs central study area overlooks a magnificent fountain, tell me another's library that has this kind of view. When you get bored of studying, go outside and sit on the lawn by the fountain, it is so relaxing.\n\nThere is a teen section in the second floor, they even break it down by kids, young audit/teens! How nice...two side of the library upstairs, fiction and nonfiction. Both of the areas aside from the main study space have additional study spaces. \n\nHarris teeter is also walking distance from here, right next door. You can go get your Starbucks there or grab a sandwich if you are hungry. \n\nWireless printing, good lighting, ample study space, ample outlets, good book selection, courteous, friendly and helpful staffs. Pretty good people who come here.
2;Are you as confused as me as how to pronouse sygn? When all it is really is an i replaced by a y? \n\nAnyway, it's an upmarket bar. I didn't find the prices insanely hiked - not exactly Wetherspoons, but I've certainly seen worse as well. Definitely not a place you want to come with a semi-dry wallet and itch to leave unable to stand. It looked more like a place you would sup a cocktail or a glass of vino rather than chug on a steiner. My only small quibble would be the extensive cocktail menu didnt' cater for the dd's like myself - although the Firefly selection of drinks were pretty delicious.\n\nHowever, overall I thought it was rather nice - a pleasant bar with table service, pleasant staff who remembered orders and didn't go too crazy even when they had guests waiting to take their (reserved) table that we had hijacked earlier on in the day (note - when I say hijacked, i mean we agreed with the waitress that we would sit there til they needed to reset the table in advance of their reservation). I would be happy to return here but definitely a little closer to pay day.
2;"This was my first time visiting Five Guys and I have to say I wasn't prepared for the experience.\n\nI mean I wasn't prepared financially. I walked in with $10 in my pocket and after looking up at the menu I quickly realized I'd be walking out with only a burger- no fries, and no drink. So, disappointed, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger \""all the way\"" with no pickles (pickles are plain evil). That ran $7.45 after tax by itself. The $2.99 for medium fries and $2.50 for a drink they are asking made my jaw drop. I heard the fries are good but no way they are $3 good.\n\nYes, I'm cheap, but I have to be. I'm broke and under-employed. The prices here are just too much.\n\nAs for the burger, It was pretty darn good I must say. Nice and juicy, big and meaty. I liked the grilled onions. They gave the burger a unique taste.\n\nAs good as the burger was, I can't see paying over $7 for one so I won't be back to Five Guys anytime soon.\n\nWhat gave me a good laugh while I was waiting for the burger was a big sign they have up on the wall that says \""Voted Best Bargain\"" by the Washington times or some east coast paper. \n\nBTW, I stopped at a Circle K on the way home and got a 32oz coke to wash it down for 79 cents!"
2;Food is good but not out of this world. The cook could learn to be more kind to the customers.
3;We were in town for a concert and planning on staying at a friends.  At the last minute we decided to book a hotel so we could have a pool to use.  I Pricelined a 5 star hotel at the Northend of the strip and got the Trump for $110.  We were kind of bummed at first but everything was great.  We checked in early and were able to upgrade to a suit for $50 more.  The rooms were very nice, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We had no problem getting the double lounge chair by the pool but the bar/resturant was under staffed and took a while for drinks.. Its a pretty small pool area but was nice bc it was smoke free!! Over all great deal!! and would be good for low keys couples who want to be off the strip and dont gamble and families.
0;I have been three times since moving to AZ, and the last two were ot by choice.  I have yet to leave without an awful headache from the ridiculously loud music.  It is cramped and the food is no better than what you'd order in a drive thru.  The prices are outrageous and the staff is less than 'happy'.  I don't know what AZ88 the other posters have been to yielding these great reviews, but if an awful headache and overpriced drive thru food served from unhappy cramped environments interests you, then this is your place.  I will never go again, even if forced.  Turn down the music and I may consider it...avoid!
4;I have never had bad food from this location. It's clean, the staff is friendly, the food is stellar! Seriously, I don't go to any other location because they've set the bar so high, I'm usually disappointed if I go anywhere else.
2;I've eaten at about 40-50 thai restaurants. Seriously...\n\nThis one is par. I totally love the Thai Taste in Spartanburg, SC. So, my expectations were a bit high. They aren't owned by the same guy although they are cousins.  The atmosphere is nicer than monsoon down the steet, but if you'd like better food. I would check out monsoon.
1;Part of the buffet of buffets promotion, this buffet is a slightly upgraded hometown buffet but if you go during peak hours, you will wait ~2hrs as we did for a party of 2. I would recommend passing on this location as all the meats were dry, they did not have enough people cleaning tables so that was the main reason there was a huge backup in the line, and overall the variety was above average but the quality was sub par. At least I didn't get food poisoning?
2;Great food. Not very expensive.
1;I was pretty disappointed with this place.  We went Thursday night for dinner and were really ready for this amazing dinner and a few items were really good, but much of it was so lacking that overall we weren't impressed.\n\nGood things:\nService was great - very friendly people and drinks refilled constantly.\nLots to pick from\nDessert - wow!!! their new york cheesecake and creme brulee was devine!\nLobster mac & cheese - delicious\nLobster bisque & clam chowder - both were really good\n\nBiggest complaints: \nthere were NO lobster tails - Not sure if they only put them out on certain nights, but bummed that there weren't any when we were there, yet other yelp reviews have people raving about them.  The only actual 'lobster' that was out was what they called a lobster medley with small pieces of lobster in the shell.  These tasted ok, but were supposed to be warm, but were barely lukewarm, making it a bit odd.\n\ncrab legs weren't good. they were cold, which was fine, but seemed as if they'd been soaked in water for a long time so the crab itself was completely mushy.  I've had better crab at red lobster if that's any indication\n\nIn the end, not somewhere I'll ever visit again.  Totally not worth the money they charge for it. Other buffets are better and cheaper.
3;"A friend recommended this place to me, though he was recommending the steak (which I don't eat).  I went anyway cause I needed a break from the high-prices and low-value of the strip.  Tuesday was italian night, so I got an appetizer, salad, chicken/pasta and a cannoli plus a glass of house wine -- all for $10.99.  Everything was tasty.  The waitress was nice; the fellow patrons were an eclectic group.  The beer was really good.  I would definitely go back.  We paid less here for dinner than we've paid for any other meal since we arrived."
3;"So I started out this year with a mindset to try out some new ways to stay in shape, and with the help of Yelps Kicks Butt, I tried out the free Crossfit class at Metro Fitness. The gym is gorgeous and the equipment looked clean and well kept. There were plenty of cardio machines as well as an extensive set of weight machines and free weights. It also has a smoothie/protein shake bar for refueling after your workout.\n\nAs to why I was there (the Crossfit class), I really had no idea what to expect. Thought it would be something like a mesh of high school football training and bootcamp. I was half right; it was nothing like bootcamp. The area in which the Crossfit classes takes place is very clean, organized, and easy to navigate. We had two trainers and the owner to help out with the class, and they were very encouraging while also making sure we maintained our form and were working out safely. We did a series of rowing, push presses, box jumps and burpies - as fast as possible within 15 minutes. We then moved from Crossfit to Athletic Conditioning (yay - two workouts in one!), which was also intense but a great workout. Nothing like warming up by pushing a 100 lb sled, right? I'll tell you one thing - I consider myself to be in decent shape - and this workout really kicked my butt (thanks, Yelp!). \n\nAs to the facility as a whole, it's absolutely gorgeous but definitely out of my price range. I would love to be able to join and do Crossfit there more often, but right now I'll just have to hope that they offer more deals in the future so I can once again have a reason to step inside and get my workout on."
3;Ever since I heard about this place I couldn't wait to find it and try it!  It was worth the wait and the effort! We ordered two slices of White Pizza which was great! Thin, crisp crust that I could still fold slightly to eat like a taco.   \n\nThis Pizza was Garlicky and Cheesy! My two favorite things on Pizza, so I was in Heaven!  The only reason I can't give it 5 Stars is that my girlfriends PBR tasted horrible, like they need to clean their lines.  The place is very small, but there are a few Wheelchair  height spots at the counter.\n\nSecret Pizza will be a must stop on my Vegas trips!
4;Awesome service and awesome prices, Work was done in quick and professional matter.....will defiantly use them again.
4;This place is absolute tops in my books. I've bought a couple of guitars and some  accessories from them in the past (strings, picks, stomp boxes, etc.). Sam Ash has always been my favorite music store in town.  But my last visit warranted a 5 star rating.  I went there because they were having a sale on Fender acoustic guitars.  All the guitars were still sealed in the factory boxes. I asked the sales guy (Jack) if he had something to cut the tape on the box so I could check it out before buying it.  Well, he opened the box, completely tuned it and played a few quick chords to make sure it was up to specs before handing it over to me.  This was totally unexpected!  Jack, you have single-handedly restored my faith in customer service here in Vegas! Thanks.
1;This casino is really outdated and in need of some major revamping.  It's quite a shame considering that the Radisson that's adjacent to the casino actually is a lovely place.  Considering the many other new and modern casinos that exist in the Phoenix metro area, this place doesn't really seem to be much of a destination except maybe for locals or people looking only to gamble and who don't care about overall ambiance.  I would opt for any other Phoenix area casino before coming to this place.
1;The tram project in Edinburgh! Most people think they will be a good idea, however almost everybody cannot stand the annoyance and delays surrounding the works. \n\nThe tram line is supposed to go from the airport to Leith. However, after only a couple of years, work is slow and progress is at a snail's pace. Last year Princes Street changed remarkably due to the noisy works blocking off cars and buses from the street. Indeed, the west end of the city seems to be undergoing constant works every time you pass it. \n\nI'm sure the trams will be brilliant when they are finished, and Edinburgh will have caught up with other European cities. However one does feel that the money could have been used to improve the already great bus service. I'm sure when they are finished, we will all like the tram system but that I am sure is a long way away.
4;"When I was a kid I used to love to go to the Hardware store to go looking at stuff and talk to the nice people that worked there.. WHen I visit this location of Ace I feel I go back in time. \nThey are super nice, super helpful but do not smoother you... They know how to make keys that work ( hard to find these days I have learned). I feel comfortable asking questions here as well. They never treat me like \""Oh you are a girl\"". I think their prices are not too bad and you get much better quality like screw that will not strip etc.. \n Parking is awesome here for people who are handicapped or have  a bad back you can park like right near the door practically.."
4;The security of this community always takes great care of us. 24/7 patrolling our streets. The actual community center is located right next to the school. That's how you know even our kids are safe. And when you need help, they come right away! This entire neighborhood is peaceful and the people here are friendly. I love that there are trails that run in-between and all through out this neighborhood. and there's long roads instead of street patches. That way when the day comes for me to finally wake up early enough, I can actually jog. If I'd want to live anywhere in Summerlin, it would be right here in this neighborhood. It's right in the heart of everything good in Summerlin.
4;mmmmm chips with melted cheese!!!  so simple yet so good!!  I might be biased though because this was a post-drinking midnight snack...
1;Malheureusement, pas d'ambiance dans ce resto cor\u00e9en, d\u00e9coration \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer et la nourriture bonne mais j'ai connu mieux. Je ne pense pas y retourner.
3;While waiting for our flight to Houston this morning, we stopped at Phipps Bistro for something to eat.  One of the airport's employees recommended their establishment, said that ate there about 3 times a week.  My wife had the cheese and egg sandwich and I had the ham, cheese and egg sandwich.  Both sandwiches were very good, with ample eggs, meat, and cheese.  The rolls were very fresh and tasty.  Very quick service.
0;SERIOUSLY?!?!  Bill goes up 7 bucks without notice?!?!?  the only reason COX is still in business is that there is no other option. \n\nIf they dont drop my bill, ive got to find another option out of principle alone.
4;After a week of no air conditioning and finally concluding that the cause was electrical in nature, I gave Good Guys a call. Mike answered right away and was able to come out to Gilbert that same afternoon! He was patient with my lack of electrical/AC maintenance knowledge and figured out the problem soon after arriving. Not only did he save me from the hell that was having no A/C, but also did so very quickly and at an awesome price. I would HIGHLY recommend Mike for any and all of your electrical needs!
3;"Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday [5.27] & heard about this place from my coworkers about a month earlier. It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.\n\nI wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.\n\nI ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.\n\nI ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 \n\nThe service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success! This place is doing great so far & I know that they will open one soon on the southwest area! *nudge nudge :)"
1;"This place is just ok at best. I've had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasn't crazy about them, but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway. I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup. I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty. I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side, so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramel-y.\n\nThe ice cream was ok - not terrible but not among the best I've had either. As for the caramel sauce, it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful.\n\nThere is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went. Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop. (Ice cream is to the right when you enter; cupcakes to the left.) We had to wipe the counter top though - there were crumbs galore on it. It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side (most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic) and not one of them could wipe down the counter top.\n\nWe returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM, but it was out of service.\n\nThis is one of those places where I can say that I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't feel the need to come back."
3;Fast and convenient.
4;Delicious!  Had the Camarones del golfo,  delicious creamy sauce, large prawns, chorizo, too die for.  Tamarind margarita,  nice and tangy.  I'm comatose! Ignore the bad reviews,  so they don't like the lighting,  they don't wanna put quarters in the meter,  they don't like the deco,  they hate coming downtown,  they want to order cheese tacos,  people please,  don't be a Steve.\n\nThis place is authentic southern Mexican food!!
2;I've had the pizza as well as a veal sorrentino. The pizza is good. Can't say that it stands out from most other places, but it's definitely worth trying at least once. The veal sorrentino was good. A big portion. I could only finish half. I'd be interested in trying other entrees. The calzones were oozing with cheese. Seemed like a ton of cheese. If you're into cheese you'd love a calzone. Prices were reasonable and there were a few specials. If you've wanted to try this place, I'd say it is definitely worth a try.
3;I believe in second chances. And I better, since it's literally in my neighborhood. I tried the shrimp salad, the cheese quesadilla. And, I also finally tried an Agua Fresca! The food was great. The shrimp salad was a great value. I needed to update my previous review- this a Mexican restaurant, with a better quality of food. You get what you pay for. And it's a good thing.
1;What is great about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat is really good about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat is OK about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat sucks about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...it is expensive like airport Starbucks only even more so.  Like two tall (SMALL) drinks for about $8 bucks.  The service was not great and the place is grungier than your typical Starbucks.
3;Ever since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale, I haven't wanted to drive to downtown Phoenix since it's such a far drive, especially after work during rush hour. Unfortunately, that means I'm missing some of my favorite restaurants! With a specific craving in mind, I went on a search and found Tommy Bahamas. After looking at their menu and their Happy Hour, I told my husband we were going here after work last Friday. I'm glad we did, because we had a really great time!\n\nWe arrived about 5pm and it wasn't too packed. We had the option of sitting outside for Happy Hour, or going upstairs into the restaurants indoor bar. We chose outside since the misters were going and wanted to unwind after being inside all day. Our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink orders. Both of us ordered the Crazy Cuban off the HH menu - a cocktail of rum, pineapple juice, and banana liquor. It was one of my cravings and it definitely hit the spot! Then we ordered the fish tacos and edamame hummus off the HH menu as well. My husband ordered the crab bisque off the dinner menu. The food arrived quickly and we dug in. The tacos were great. We both really enjoyed them and would order them again. The hummus was okay. It was cold and came with long rectangular crackers they called flat bread. To me, flat bread is like pita bread and they were crackers. There's a difference. My husband thought the hummus was good and he ate more of it than me. Still a little hungry, we decided to order the Cuban. Oh god, I am so glad we did. It had pulled pork, ham, gruyere cheese, pickles, and spicy mustard. This was a flavor combination of the gods. My husband and I really enjoyed this and it's our new favorite. It came with Yucca Fries, which we decided to try, but you could sub them for something else. (Yucca Fries are made from the root of the Yucca plant and are like deep fried potatoes - they weren't anything special in my opinion.) Finally, the dessert tray came circling around. They had so many delicious looking desserts to try. A chocolate cake, a butterscotch pudding, a pineapple cr\u00e8me brulee, a pina colada cake, and a chocolate malt tart. We ordered the chocolate malt tart but it was a tough decision. (We'll have to come back to try some of the others.) The tart was delicious was very heavy. We took about 90% of it home to enjoy later. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and we'll be back. I'd recommend going during Happy Hour especially!
4;First time here and this place is pretty good. The prices on food is reasonable.  The lentil soup is delicious, and lamb kabob was cooked right.
0;NEVER again am i going to this GHETTO ass club! A bachelorette party starting a fight?? Are you serious? What a joke. \n\nThe only cool thing about this club is that they played songs from Michael Jackson. Other than that...it's like any other club you might find in TJ.
1;"Very fun atmosphere. Bright insides with great artwork EVERYWHERE! The food is fresh and made to order. Lots of specials. I had the chicken salad sandwich and fresh New England clam chowder soup. Tons of clams in the soup and the chicken salad was good (had apples and celery). I specially asked for Miracle Whip (request option on the menu) on the sandwich and that was a great blast from the past taste. \n\nI liked the music playing and the games on every table. Great service too.\n\nPROS: Great interior and excellent service.\n\nCONS: Food was just average at best.\n             My boyfriend HATED it. \n            *Big Fish Sandwich - Over breaded and too much bread in general. \n             Needed more tartar sauce or lettuce or something.\n             *Chicken Avocado BLT - I ordered \""breaded\"" for the chicken. \n              It came out fried to a crisp and the thin cutlet inside was dry as a bone. \n\nTwo stars only because of the great atmosphere and decor. I would give the service 5 stars if that was a separate option."
0;Okay, so this is the second year I've gone to Foodie Fest.  Last year we went on a Friday night, this year on Saturday at 6:30.  The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived, but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\n\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive, however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway, saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer, however almost all was gone, our choices were Miller Light, wine or water!  It seemed so pointless, so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \n\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00, the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste, but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.  All I kept saying is that I felt ripped off $28 down the drain in 30 min. or less and we were still hungry!  \n\nThe event, in my opinion, was poorly run, poorly organized and the staff seemed a bit clueless (texting, calling & not paying attention).  I feel sorry for the folks who continued to wait in line. I doubt we will return to this event, I'd rather continue our trips down to First Friday (Downtown) and Vegas StrEATs (at El Cortez). MUCH better and most of the trucks are at these locations anyway.  \n\nBoo.
0;"I can't rate the food - the people at the counter were so rude to me that I decided to leave before ordering.  \n\nIs this part of the \""Essence\"" of this place?"
3;So, I found this bagel place because its in the same shopping strip as my 'new' Fry's grocery store.\n\nI went in, and it was pretty good.  They have a nice variety of fresh bagels, sandwiches, and a nice menu selection of items to choose from.  I went with a bagel, and asked if they had lox cream cheese.  He said that he would make it fresh for me on request!  wooohoo!\n\nI really like this place better then Einstiens, and the guys there seem to be friendly and cool.   Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning!\n\nPS.  This is my 100th review!  go me!
4;The salon was awesome. I was from out of town and thought I'd get a much needed haircut while my boyfriend had a business meeting. I called up and they squeezed me in. Allison was great! She has a happy personality and really enjoyed working with my hair and both showed. She really listened and stuck to to what I wanted, explained her techniques and taught me some new ways to get a great blowout. Her blowouts are fabulous...I have thick wavy hair and usually get a Deva cut but it was a treat to get a blunt cut and a blowout. Two days later the cut still looks great even though I wear it wavy. I'm in Vegas once or twice a year for work and will definitely come back again next time.
0;How in the world can you mess up spare ribs? Or chicken? Or the rice in sushi? Come on Treasure Island! What the heck? I've been to many, many buffets in Vegas and hands down, this is the worst I've ever been to. Granted, I went during lunch time so I can't comment on quality or value during dinner, but this was absolutely horrible.\n\nThe good:\n(Total 3 stars)\nDesserts were actually pretty good. Red velvet cupcake, pineapple upside down miniature cake, very good cookies, real Dreyers Grand ice cream. And, oh, they didn't mess up the ice tea. The mashed sweet potato was very good. \n\nThe bad:\n(Total -2 stars)\nWow...where do I begin. Okay, I rarely ever eat sushi at these buffets but since they had no shrimp or crab or mussels or any other seafood during lunch time despite a $20.95 price tag, but I was desperate for anything somewhat fishy. How do I describe the rice? Let me see...a cross between spoiled pudding, 5 day old rice, and concrete grounds. I actually just took the small pieces of fish and shrimp on this sad excuse of sushi rice, ate the fish and used the rice to build a pyramid on my plate. Yes, I've eaten at AYCE sushi buffets so I don't equate them to sushi restaurants, but my goodness this was horrid. Pork ribs? Well, they display real oak wood behind the serving counter at the bbq area, but it's not oak-fired ribs. It was artificial smoke flavor...and it was putrid. Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost. Treasure Island, please wake up, and guests STAY AWAY from this buffet. First time I've stayed at this hotel, and the rooms were actually pretty good, but the buffet actually ruined the experience.
0;"this club is only full because marquee is too hard to get into...\n\nwe decided to check out this place because some promoter talked us into going... hmm... shoulda known... but at least he was nice?\n\n1 star for:\n- mean hostess... if you hate your job, why are you there? plus, your club is like second tier, so you should be nice to us girls who are coming in... cuz you need us to bring the boys...\n\n- drinks are extra expensive... $60 dollar for 4 small shots; $8 for a bottle of water... i guess it's justified if the scene deserves it... but it doesnt...\n\n- the place is relatively small... and no where to sit unless you have a table\n\nspend your money elsewhere"
3;"I like the Light Rail.  Just wish it went more places.  From my house I can walk 10 minutes to the nearest stop, and from there go to Harkins fancy new theater at Christown, do some shopping while I\""m there. Or do a day off of Phoenix Art Museum, the Heard Museum, lunch at Fez, down to City Center.  Some days it's fun to go down to Mill Ave and wander.  Sadly, Snottsdale denied the light rail a home, so I have to drive to work (or take my bike on the rail and then ride my bike for another 20 minutes uphill)....I may as just well bike the whole way.  \n\nGreat value, $5 for a day pass, ride it all you want.  Don't understand the crabby attitudes of some of these reviewers.  Drive your gas guzzler all you want and stay off the light rail if you hate it so much."
3;Enjoyed fries served with 3 different dips, fresh apple/pecan salad, as well as most delicious scallops and truffle mac n cheese!  Hubby loved his steak!  Our server, Glen, was very attentive, friendly and fast!  Busy place, will return.
0;Okay coffee. But I think people only go here to see girls in lingerie make coffee! Haha but if that's what people like!
2;"If you go to a Cirque show, it really shouldn't matter which one because they are all good.  Most of the other Cirque show doesn't really have a story.  This one does.  But the grandeur of the special effects, not the story, steals the headlines.  It's big and therefore awesome.  Having said that, the individual talent from the Mystere show clearly unshines the individual talents of this show.  You won't be disappointed; it just because of the story, it can get boring at times in between the grand exhibits."
0;"I am stunned. I have read reviews and people say it is just like PF Changs. Whoa I don't think so. I was in the process of ordering online but since this was the first time I wanted to make sure they made it the crispy shrimp they advertise instead of just shrimp as it is on their online menu. I phoned the order in and told them crispy shrimp, with emphasis...instead when I got home I received soggy \""honey glazed\"" chicken, which almost indefinitely was simply sweet and sour sauce. I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have \""steak\"" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland \""crispy\"" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.  The Thai peanut sauce tasted like something my young child would make, unedible.  I hope you don't waste your money here, BJ's restaurant is right there, as well as Islands, NY Pizza which has some of the best pizzas in town."
4;"A stunning journey of sound, history, and legacy, Michael Jackson ONE certainly lives up to the expectations of diehard MJ fans. The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. \n\nThe music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJ's original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. \n\nThe theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJ's presence.  We are the same, we are ONE. \n\nThe symbolism of MJ's glove, hat, and socks is empowering, because the objects represent the legacy that is visible to the eyes and tangible to the touch. I really love it.  \n\nYou will notice the original dance moves are shown last in the choreography of each song. Instead of presenting a blatant imitation, the choreography gracefully conveys the message, \""We want to dance like the King.\"" Creativity and freshness dance on stage. \n\nInterestingly, there is also the element of rebuttal against the media. On the injustice of social media, I cannot empathize more with MJ. I was glad the show touches on that aspect of MJ's life. \n\nAll I am trying to say is, if you love MJ, you will enjoy the show. \n\nOn the down side, I was only half-impressed by the acrobatics. Some acts hit the plateau rather quickly as the movements become repetitive. Some lack the grace and difficulty. On a few occasions, you could tell the performers were trying too hard to match the beats. Some performances, such as stick fighting, are extraneous, while the over-presence of the popper and guitar player suggests a limited cast. In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. \n\nYou are paying for the beautiful production. The level of details, the authenticity, the nuanced themes, and the empowering message give all the reasons to live through this hour-and-half of immortality with the King."
4;Have always gotten the Italian hoagie but never actually stepped inside the restaurant.  Our NYC friend was visiting town and he wanted to see the Mattress Factory.  So we were both hungry and Peppi's was on the way and the atmosphere was awesome and fun.  While waiting for our food, an employee there also recommended us to check out RandyLand, which is also down the street.  Great Food and Great people!  Thanks Guys!
0;You can rename and put lipstick on a Pig, but the fact is its still a PIG. Look at the 600+ reviews on their previous business page for The Quad Las Vegas Resort & Casino. It tells the story. They may have remodeled part of it but the fact is their management team is less than stellar and their housekeeping is atrocious. Watch out for unadvertised extra fees and credit card hold charges without advanced authorization. Its one thing if they actually cared and tried to learn from reviews and customer complaints but the fact is they just dont care. If negative reviews existed, this hotel would be the poster child...
1;My co-worker and I stopped in early for lunch today. Really happy with the food and service.   I gotta say that the stinky wild eyed bum yelling at his imaginary friend coming in and out was alarming.  What is weird is you're promoting him to come in and bathe in the Soft Drink Fountain.  I really wanted a refill and you could not pay me to go near it after seeing him sticking his fingers in where the soda comes out.  Yuck Yuck Yuck
0;Oh My gosh, This has to be the worst pizza I have in 20 years. I tried the 4.99 deal to try the slices and I ordered a slice with sausage and one pepperoni, I was told only one topping for lunch special. I bought a drink from fountain, it had no ice and the pop tasted odd!  I decided to glance at the kitchen since no one was in pizza place at 12:30 (lunch ???), and saw the kitchen help put sausage on my pizza slice with no gloves on. Now what was this weird taste of this slice, Oh the dough was frozen and then baked, the sauce from a bag or can at best and the cheese was tasteless. I am not even mentioning the terrible meat. The place also had a weird smell coming through vents??  I hate Pizza Hut with a passion and I wished I had the pizza from Pizza Hut that use to occupy this location if I did it would been 100% better that what I had.
0;SLOW AS FUCK. Don't come here unless you are not hungry. Food takes forever. Great place if you want to drink beer and watch TV and not eat
1;me and a friend went there to Eat on feb 25 2014 and service was not so great. food was okay and  price of food was okay but I think its over priced for the portion of food they give you was way to little.
4;Great hot dog and chicken panini to-go!! Couldn't wait to write a review before I ate my chocolate-chocolate chip cookie.
1;Dr Whipple is a really good doctor, but unless you're retired and have all day to go to appointments, you might want to find another doctor.  You will never wait less than 1.5 hours, and the staff is less than friendly.
3;"Let me just start off by saying... I ADORE THIS PLACE. Everything about this place, I love. I love that they do not have plastic bags and only carry paper brown bags. I love their healthy selections, their incredible produce department , their beautiful flowers that they have year round.. And all of their products. Here are some of my favorite things: Indian veggie burgers- these are incredible, potato like burgers with a slight hint if curry; they go perfectly with trader joes Mango chutney- which is also incredible. I love their tangerine juice, it's such a nice unique twist on orange juice and super sweet. Trader joes unsweetened vanilla almond milk is the best almond milk I can find. Their meatless mandarin orange chicken is my FAVORITE. I buy it by the dozen. Trader joes is the cheapest place for healthier options like quinoa, coconut milk ice cream and meatless options too. Their meatless ground beef is my favorite. They have amazing customer service and will take back anything if you have your receipt. I have tried a lot of their dried fruits and I bought dried peaches once and hated them- they took them back without even blinking. The only item that I do not prefer from trader joes is their meat items- my boyfriend loves their rib eye, but considering they do not have a butcher on the site, I do not buy their meat.. I don't know how fresh it is and therefore I do not trust it. That's the only reason they have not received 5 stars from me.. I love trader joes overall and it's a must for my biweekly grocery shopping sprees."
4;Their food is made of magic.
4;*STOP SEARCHING BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT AND GO* \n\nOK....Service was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite. \n\nFood was put of this world....from citrus chicken to chow mein. Also, how did they make fried rice taste like heaven!? Seriously, I could not stop. Fresh and not greasy. HUGE portions. \n\nCame in at 630ish on a Friday night and was empty. Within an hour it was jammed packed. We met George!!! Not only does he walk around and talk to customers, HE WORKS! From serving to bussing. Blew me away. \n\nThe Yelp check-in deal is over a year old. He is having some trouble with Yelp. He explained his issue, and it sounds legit. He did honor it because we came all the way from Chandler. \n\nWE WILL BE BACK ASAP!! \n\nFYI....taste amazing left over and even cold. That's legit.
3;I have eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food.  However, I come here mostly for the Campfire Smores shake ( alcohol infused).  I really don't taste too much alcohol in any of their shakes, but they are quite delicious.  \n\nThe Rising Sun burger is very good as well as the Hen house.
0;"Nothing is new here about my bad experience. But hopefully I can shed some light into their evil world. And then the travelers can choose wisely.\n\nUS Worst has retained its title for me in 2011.\n\nTypical story. Mechanical failure. Flight was delayed in Palm Springs. I missed the connection in Phoenix. I was rescheduled for later flight. A delay of 4 hours.\n\nI always avoid US Worst but sometimes it's just impossible. It helps when US Worst is part of Star Alliance (Wrong... more later). I was a United Premier member. I thought I still can get my benefit on US Worst. That's a wrong assumption.\n\nI have experienced nightmares on more than 50% of US Worst flights. More so lately... 100% in past 2 years (2 flights). Luckily I've shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.\n\nTo make a long tedious nightmare educational:\n1) US Worst does not recognize the full status of United Premier. Not like United and Continental.\n\n2) It's business as usual for US Worst. The costumer service rep expressed indifference. It reminds me of rental clerks in Las Vegas and FlorIda (\""you don't like it? Too bad! Move aside, there's a long line waiting for our premiere service\"") There is no apology. The mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation.\n\nSo travelers, kowtow to the Almighty US Worst whom provides world class service to everyone. I wonder what service you will get in economy class."
0;Tried for lunch... Friday, half empty and told me food would be 20 minutes after ordered.  20 minutes later... another 20 minutes for a half empty restraunt.
0;We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I don't recommend going to this store.
0;WORST MASSAGE OF MY LIFE! I literally left in tears, it was so painful. Yelp reviews are way wrong. Ended up paying $76 for two massages. Total of $100. I gave them a $100 bill and they look confused when I asked them for change. I asked the guy to be more gentle about 5 times and he did not listen. Go to the other places around this area, they are 10-20/hr. What a waste of $100 and now I probably need to see a chiropractor to fix my back because of these people.  So I just said F* this place and walked out. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!
0;I love BBQ, and always went to Famous Dave's.  Looking for a new BBQ place, I found Li'l Porgy.  My first impression when I first entered the establishment was disappointment.  It was small, dull, and not clean.  I did hope that the food would be good, but it was another disappointment.  I ordered rip tips and it smelled bad.  I haven't been back there ever since.
0;This steakhouse really shows its age, in a sad way. Food and service are overrated. Tourists may still go there, along with people who equate dull with reassuring.\n\nDo avoid, unless you're invited or dating the wrong person.
4;Place kills it!\nGreat service and awesome pho Fasho...\nGood boba selection. The little homie who works the floor is coo as heck. The coolest thing about this place is that is clean clean..
0;Imagine, a brewpub without its own brews! How quaint! How.....stupid. We laughed this one up as yet another Las Vegas scam, however unintentional.   No reason to go here.  Not one.
3;mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.
0;Pretty good, but food wasn't very fresh. I kinda felt sick afterward...but it was a lot of choices...and good if you just want taste and not quality.
0;Lets see 1st the TV and toilet were broke when i got there , I drove in from LA got there late just wanted to sleep , they were going to send someone up to fix this stuff while i waited. I convinced them into giving me a new room. I  go to my truck to drive to the convention i was doing , and discover my truck was broken into , my gps, sub woofer, skateboard , and everything else that wast bolted down was stolen.. so security in the parking garage was horrible.   I gambled for 5 straight hours on a saturday night and not one person asked me if i wanted a drink .The last day when i checked out I told the guy at the front desk how un happy i was about the gold coast experience , and he looked at me and shrugged ... no offer of anything to make me feel better..  the one star i gave it was based on the fact that i won a little cash ... \nI seriously advise anyone looking for a hotel in vegas to stay clear from this place . I work in the entertainment business and travel all over , and this by far is the most horrible hotel experience I've ever encountered . If you want to have a fun time in vegas ..STAY SOME WHERE ELSE!!!
1;Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week based on the good reviews of the place.  Service was quick and friendly. Ordered a lunch combo (spicy noodle?) with tofu.  The soup that came with it was a little sad... it was about 2 spoonfuls, no kidding.  \n\nRest of the food came quickly and looked much more promising than the soup, however I took a bite of the spring roll and immediately realized that this would NOT be my #1 thai place, nor #52 on the list.\n\nThe spring roll was cold (yes, cold, not even lukewarm) and so was some of the tofu throughout the dish.  The dish itself had good flavor, but the random cold pieces of tofu were a turn off to say the least.  Disappointing meal & I won't be returning.
2;This park is hidden in a residential area, so if you're not specifically searching for it, you will miss it.  It's a one-way road from the entrance so, again, be on the look-out for the park.  Parking is plentiful.\n\nOnce you do get to the park, it's nice.  There are two runs, one for large dogs and one for small dogs, though the distinction here is 25lbs up or down while at other parks I've seen it's 35lbs up or down.  \n\nAnyway, the runs are long and fairly wide, and there is seating for the people.  The times I've gone it's always been very quiet, just me, the furball, and maybe another two or three people and dogs.  The people and dogs that I've run into have been really friendly though, so kudos to dog-park hospitality.  \n\nIt's a solid dog park and it asks for returns, I just would like to have more dogs and people present.
4;Mmmm... First time here. Foods amazing!!! cant wait to go back!!
1;I used to love it here. For years it was the best burger in town. But, I have to say the last couple times we've been here I've been really disappointed. The burger is BLAND now. I have to take this place off the list, too bad. Houston's/Hillstone burger has never disappointed, so we'll be going there from now on.
3;Great wrap. I would return. This will probably be my new breakfast spot I take visitors.
2;I was expecting more of a bakery, but it is primarily a coffee shop that serves a small selection of baked goods and sandwiches.  We ordered a pair of blueberry muffins, a coffee and a chocolate chip cookie.  The muffins were nothing special, the coffee was good and they initially forgot to serve me the cookie.  I ended up with both my original cookie plus a second one as an apology.  The cookies were mediocre and very much overpriced unless you get a 2nd one free.  LOL\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience but not one I expect to experience again.\n\nA rating of 2.5 would be more appropriate.
3;This is a great little place.   It is located on the royal mile, the street you take to get to the castle.   \nThe waiter we had was very friendly and helpful. Iglesias gave good recommendations and his thoughts on the menu items.  \nHe took excellent care of us even though he was extremely busy.  \nI had the haggis with nipps and tats aid haggis with turnips and mashed potatoes.  \nMy partner had the pulled pork pizza.   Both items were very well priced and filling.   \nWe will stop back in here before we head home.
0;This is absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my entire life.  From the moment that I stepped into the door, I was greeted by nothing but the cold shoulder and the tapping of text messages being sent.  Words to the owner about surviving in retail, the business is all about how you treat the people who walk in.
2;"Food is great. Prices are through the roof. \nHostess is usually high on something and uses the \""F\"" word in every sentence. Also hogs the tables for annoyingly long time. We are there to eat not be your best \""F\"" buddies!!!!"
2;A little too dark but still a nice place. Forgot what drink I ordered but it was tasty. Its a small  setting and good for small group of friends to have a few drinks. Very relaxed atmosphere.
0;"Granted, it's Hooters.  And Hooters in Vegas is ten times worse than anything you can possibly imagine.  However in this economy customer service is essential for a business to thrive.  The valet attendant who simply drove our vehicle and left the car without saying anything to us and didn't offer to assist with luggage made the choice of tip amount simple.  Zero.  Because he didn't even say a word to us as he walked by, presumably to take his smoke break.  \n\nThe pool is open 24/7 all year round, however it's all guys there, and I'd hate to even think of the sperm count contained within.  The only women at that pool are the hooters girls, and they're paid to flirt with you.  You're not that funny.  In fact, watching you from my window I saw most of the waitresses avoiding you after hassling them for your fifth picture and yelling, \""sluts!\""\n\nThe next door neighbors violently vomiting (with the door open?) until 5 am is to be expected in Vegas at a \""red neck haven\"" such as this one.  If you can afford to go somewhere else, do so.  Otherwise, stay home, save your money and buy a pair of shoes.\n\nThat said, the servers were nice.  You have to be respectful to them and you may get the same waitress back to the table more than once.  If you're a d-bag or harassing, it seems they'll send a different one to take over."
0;The fries were terrible, there are no free refills, burger was just ok, and they have false advertising with the free milk shake!! Don't eat here ever!!!!
4;i love the outlets. It has more shopping selections i love.
0;A bar that charges you $15-$45 to get in and won't allow you to take pictures, but then charges you $20 a photo? FAIL
3;Man this place is pretty darn yummy. The ice cream here is so dense and creamy. I can't imagine having any size bigger than their smallest size. It definitely hits the spot during those hot AZ summer nights.
3;Great specials.  The food is light and is not greasy at all.  Taste very fresh.  Would visit again
3;I love this park, first of all it's huge!  They have just about everything here (a dog park, sand volleyball courts, picnic pavilions, BBQ grills, playground, and a lot of free space with Actual Grass!). There is just about everything you would need for a great picnic or a game of football with some friends.  I usually run through here a lot and there is just a great atmosphere in the park, so check it out for yourself and have a great day!
4;Great large chopped salad and toasted ravioli
3;I visited Scottdale with the kids---was very happy initially to find a place that was easy on the wallet.  But then I ordered the Corn Beef Hash (recommended by the waittress), and WOW---that was just a wonderful experience that I will definitely revisit next time I'm in the neighborhood!
3;Great place on Tuesday for cheap tacos and beers.  The outdoor patio is awesome when the weather is nice.
1;Very expensive I came here for a car was with a $10 coupon and they wanted $11 more for interior clean. So I got exterior only. Didn't fininsh the drying, had to drive my own car through the wash. Don't think I would go there again.
0;Stayed in the hotel for a 3 day softball tournament. The location is great, but it's just not the cleanest. The place just looks like management doesn't care anymore. The hotel smells. The bungalows were a little better, but the view of the empty pool & raggedy resort area with construction tape everywhere left a lot to be desired. \n\nI complained, moved rooms, and even asked the room to be cleaned again, but their idea of presentation and mine are very different. Next time, I'll just spend the extra money.
0;This place has pretty nice decor when you walk in, we can here for lunch and got the lunch specials, which was very inexpensive and a pretty good deal. Comes with soup, salad and soda for $6.95. my bf ordered the pad thai and I got the chicken with bell  peppers and basil. It was just bleh and ok to my taste. They gave us hot mustard which I felt was very chinese and not too thai authentic.
3;Second visit to Fresh Wasabi back in early September... \n\nArizona Rolls, fabulous... As I previously stated, we are not sushi fans, I must amend, we were not sushi fans, we are beginning to be now... And the Arizona Roll is what brought us around!  Very fresh, firm but not sticky rice that was also very light.  The Wasabi was full of flavor but not too hot.  We do wish they had given us a little more though...\n\nCalamari... It was ok, it was chewy, rubbery, over cooked.  The batter was really good and the sauce was tasty and this was the saving grace. Once the calamari cooled though, it was just gross...\n\nUdon noodles, again, very hot, Momma said too hot and based on my prior experience with them, I have to agree.  The broth was fabulous, again, and the yummies in the dish were just that, yummy!  I still think it needed more meat, but it is a noodle dish...\n\nSpicy chicken dinner combo... Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but the spices and sauce were phenomenal!!!!!!  Portion was really good and plentiful without being too much...\n\nAs with last time, for some reason I have a hard time pin-pointing, the service was lacking.  We got drink refills and it was reasonably attentive, but something was missing... At least this time there was no dissertation on bento boxes and sushi... Wish I could figure out what it was... Just off somehow... \n\nOverall, they earned a star over last visit and we will be back, no doubt!
0;Stay away from this medical center unless you have plenty of time and don't mind having your credit ruined.  My insurance company paid them and I paid my copay for one office visit.  So far I've wasted two hours proving the $100 office visit has been paid in full 8 months ago. They are now telling me I have 10 days to pay $206 (instead of the $100) or they will send this to collections. Anyone know of a good attorney?
3;Another stop on our aquariums on the Strip tour. \n\nThe way the Shark Reef is decorated is quite nice actually. We didn't use the audio self-guided tour because we're lazy like that. I'm sure it was informative.\n\nThere's more than just sharks. There's also some interesting fish (like piranhas) and reptiles. It's not the best exhibit we've ever been to, but it was pretty fun for us. We like aquariums and the like. \n\nIt gets really crowded at the shark exhibit but presumably that's what everyone's there for.
2;This is a pretty cool place in the heart of Bloomfield. I've never eaten at the restaurant, but I've frequented the bar and it's always been serviceable. The bar in the front is very open with four sides and a bunch of TV's for game-watching. There's always some cute girl behind the bar looking to catch tips from young or old single guys from the neighborhood. Had some food at the bar once that was alright. Good for a stop-in at some point.
0;I used to love Kanpai - great prices, quality food, and an excellent staff. I don't know if it was sold or what they are doing but 'Sushi Ave' is now treading on the classic and established Kanpai name. Prices are higher, portions are smaller, and the quality of the fish is horrid. All my old favorites are gone and the recipes have all changed. \n\nI'm really disappointed to lose one of my favorite sushi bars in Phoenix, but as one of the new staff said 'we have to change it up'. Sadly I won't be back and I don't suggest they be allowed to continue to tarnish such an established name.
1;I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good, I like their batter, but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  I'm not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any I've had from the Safeway deli.
4;I finally returned and I am glad that I did. The off putting smell of eggs upon entering is no longer there. The service was extremely attentive and efficient. We were seated immediately and our drinks came out quickly. The server was pleasant and professional. I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger and we shared the oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer. We cleaned our plates! The burger was so much better than I remember, and it appears that some positive changes were implemented since my last visit over six months ago. Another great local business to add back to my list of neighborhood favorites!
0;"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.\n\nGradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.\n\nThe fish \""special\"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.\n\nThey have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."
1;Service was ok and food wasn't any better.  The Orange chicken was ok, however the egg drop soup and fried rice left a lot to be desired.  Price is pretty good for a big lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning.
1;Small location located in china town...it looks kinda dingy when you walk in, especially compared to the giant Lee's sandwiches a block away. Everything is marked up (though still cheap for Vegas) as compared to California ($2.75 for THREE spring rolls in the 626, here is $4 for two). But hey, when you're desperate for some asian yummies and you aren't willing to shell out $8 for non-legit spring rolls on the strip, you gotta go somewhere, right? \n\nThe desserts are pretty yummy...pandan-coconut milk-coffee jello is a bit too sweet. Coconut milk with taro, yam, and tapioca is super yum. Spring rolls are squishy...shrimp ones (goi cuon) is very squishy and mostly rice paper. The vegetarian spring rolls are insanely dry. And yet...I keep coming back :X Mostly for the desserts!
4;"I've been here twice in the last year, and am happy to say that both times were incredible. The last time was on my birthday, when my wife set up a very nice dinner for two and we had the Chef's Tasting with the wine pairing. Like others who have reviewed Legume, we found our service to be excellent, and enjoyed the presentation of each course.\n\nThe food here is absolutely flavorful and delicious. It's the kind of place that can almost make you consider licking your plate when nobody's watching you. (Not that I did that, but I wanted to... luckily there was bread to help me take full advantage of the sauces...) Every item was perfectly cooked and delicious - from our fish course, through the lamb carpaccio, to the dessert finale, all of the proteins and garnishes were complimentary to each other and well prepared.\n\nThe only minor \""flaw\"" was that they feel the need to maximize their space by putting a table for two right next to the doors to the kitchen - now, Legume is not the concept restaurant where you sit in full view of the kitchen, so this seems like a little bit of an afterthought. The problem for us was that in an otherwise quiet, slightly dark and romantic space, we were seated in a bright and somewhat loud section. I would have rather waited for another table in the main part of the restaurant; it would have paired better with the overall culinary experience. That being said, the food was so good here that I am not docking any stars for this...\n\nWill definitely return."
1;It seems to me like the quality of this place is rapidly declining.  The service has always been slow, and now it has slowed down to the point where you actually are forgotten.  The last time I went, my friend and I were told they didn't have a drink list.  I ordered a martini from the old drink list, and it was nothing like the previous 30 French Martinis I've had @ Momo.  The quality of the food has also taken a serious hit.  First, the chocolate gooey dessert somehow became an overcooked brownie with Hershey's syrup on top.  The pizza used to be delightful - just the right size to share with a friend, with a lovely homemadey crust.  Now you get something that appears to have been on sale in the freezer department at the local grocery store.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but this place is too dark.  I get a headache from squinting at my friends while I'm there.  I appreciate mood lighting, but Momo is so dark I wonder if maybe they don't pay their electricity bills.  The wine list is pretty good, and it can be fun to see bands there, but those alone aren't enough to keep me coming back like I used to.
2;I'm rating the Bingo here.  This place is really fun and cheap.  You can play and play all day and sometimes actually win.  And if your are lame like me you can get a machine to do all the work.  This place is stuffy, stinky and seedy but you're in Vegas so why not.  They have a smoking section in the Bingo hall but it might as well be the whole place because its one small room that hasn't been renovated since who knows when.  You get free donuts, chips and sodas.  The bar waitress comes in and gives free drinks and if you tip her well she will come back over and over again.  This place is fun to try out when you are tired of the strip and/or have time to kill before a flight.  Oh and don't forget to sign up for their players card it comes with a coupon book that has an additional bingo discount.  And BEWARE of the bingo sharks there.  Since I've been there a few times you tend to see the same locals who are hard core with tons of cards and machines that win all the time!
3;If you want to do your bit for your neighbourhood, forget about Blockbuster and other such DVD chains. Vogue Video may be small, but it's mighty. In a time of movie piracy and big chains I am surprised and relieved that this place has survived and thrived.\nMy friends and I usually  come here for our movie needs and it's up to date with what's out and popular, and the staff has always been friendly and quite chatty. Unlike their large competitor up the street they won't spent an age tapping away on the computer so you can get your movie. \n\nThe only thing I can hold against it is it's early closing time in winter. But the selection is great, at affordable prices as well. Be warned though it's not all in alphabetical order so don't be shy to ask if you can't find what you are after!
4;A delicious breath of fresh air just off the craziness of the strip. Their breakfast is really good, and for a great price. Greek Omelette was huge and filled with lots of feta! Their French toast is thick and cinnamony! Everyone was really friendly and the service was terrific.
4;Everyone there is awesome! There's no better place to go from weight loss, hormones, medical and anti aging. Dr. Goldsmith is even board certified in all. I've searched for another clinic like this when they moved and believe me, there is NONE. Worth the drive.
0;Wow this is an old hotel that they have tried to update but not successfully. The beds are very comfortable, pillows are HORRIBLE, not enough outlet to charge devices. \n\nThe checkin was an hour + wait. It's clear management does not care because the staff does not care. No one working for the hotel seem nice or customer service oriented. The food was horrible don't eat there.  Parking is on the opposite end of everything and very hard to access\n\nI will not be staying here again for any reason given the price vs quality. Although it is well situated on the strip.
3;I literally live across the street and come in all the time. Today wasn't a pleasant visit, my waitress was so unfriendly never came by to ask if we were ok. The hostess had to ask if we've been helped yet and got us our drink order. She also has to get us our refills and our check. When the waitress braught us our check she put it on the table and walked away without saying a word or looking at us, So I gave the hostess the tip and said thank you. I give it 4 stars because the food is amazing and so was the hostess at the door. The waitress I'll never sit in her section if she is ever there.
3;While in Vegas for Christmas we were in the mood for spicy beef.  While on the strip, we used Yelp to help us navigate our way to good Korean food - on Christmas Day!\n\nWe called ahead to make sure they were open and yes was the answer I wanted to hear.\n\nFrom the M & M Factory we made our way and when we got there, every seat was taken.  Good sign.\n\nOur wait was only 10 minutes, we sat down and the server arrived with glasses of water within minutes.  The place was packed with a lot of people there, we knew this place had to be good.\n \nThe menu is like any menu you see at other Korean restaurants so it was hard to decide what we wanted.  I wanted Dolsot Bibimbap and my BF had Bulgogi.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and I must say, that is the best Dolsot I ever had.  Everything was tasty.
2;Much better than the last time we saw him at the Riviera.  He is at Hard Rock now, my cousin wanted to see him so we all got drug there.\n\nHe is really rough with language and comments about sex were stomach turning, just really nasty so it was a turn off.  However, he is an icon because he was famous.  He WAS.  Not anymore and probably for this reason.\n\nWhen we went to the Riviera the bar prices were half of what we paid here, 12 bucks for drinks?  Ridiculously priced.\n\nOur group agreed that Vinnie Favorito was a better show but also had ridiculous bar prices.
3;"\""OK, even with the good and bad reviews, let's try it.\""  It was exceptional. So far it was the best shredded beef chimichanga I have had in Casa Grande. Beautifully prepared filled to capacity with beef.  On the plate a pile of guacamole, sour cream and lettuce.  Mrs had 3 tostadas,  also presented very well.  She brought home 2 of them.  Extremely quick service with a well trained happy waitress.  Small bowl of chips was replenished when empty. Salsa was really sauce in a catsup squeeze bottle- a little odd, but OK. All in all a very pleasant experience at a very reasonable price.  We'll return"
2;As with the previous review I'll agree that this place is hit or miss. I used to work at a restaurant nearby and bought fruit here for drinks and dessert garnishes, I always had to be careful what I picked.\n\nHowever, it is cheap, has a good variety of fruit and veg and all the staff have good chat so I say give this place a go and make sure you keep your eyes open when your choosing!
4;"This place is amazing. \nI am by no means a German Food critic - nor do I know what German food is \""supposed\"" to taste like, but hopefully this is it, because it's amazing.  My husband was stationed in Germany for 6 Years, and he loves it... so I trust his opinion. \n\nI love the beer, I love the spatzel, I LOVE the snitzel. \n\nI bring everyone to Haus Murphy I can, because everything is amazing. \nA few times, I brought my parents and there was a polka bang being amazing in the bar area. \n\nI love this resturant."
1;"I've been to Hana Sushi about a half dozen times for lunch over the last two years.  The location is very close to where I work and live; I desperately want this place to be perfect, but sadly, it misses the mark.\n\nFirst, it's closed on Mondays, which is somewhat annoying, because I always seem to forget about that.  I've been there twice on a Monday and had to go somewhere else as a result.\n\nThe second problem is that when you go shortly after they open for lunch, they apparently have just started to prepare their rice for the day.  When you order a 2-piece on rice, we don't expect the rice to be warm!  It should be cold, or at least below room temperature.  The mixture of lukewarm rice and cold sushi in my mouth is not appetizing--and this happened every time I went.\n\nThe appetizer salad and creamy dressing was quite good, and the service was good as well.  If they could get over the warm rice thing, this could be a better place."
0;"One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!\n\nThe have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).  \n\n$9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.\n\nI saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice. \n\nOne out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.\n\nI entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4\"" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.\n\nWhat Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right."
1;I was so excited to see that this restaurant re-opened... Unfortunately that was short lived :-(  Took our family of 5 there tonight for dinner. Service was very poor, I think we actually offended our waitress by asking for drink refills! Food was was too salty and we all left with stomach aches. The salsa's were good... But they charged 1.89 for about 2 tbsp of mango salsa :-O.  After they nickel and dimed us we left disappointed .. And will not return
1;Disappointing on several levels.  First, the good news.  Service was incredible as was the ginger beer thyme infused cocktail.  Order it at the bar and don't venture any further.  Now onto the bad news.  Octopus appetizer that everyone raves about?  Over spiced and served with a tentacle so huge it looked like a prop from a Richard Basehart submarine movie.  Back off on the salt boys.  It was pickled in it.  Bone in ribeye was tasty but greasy as were the short ribs.\n\nBrussels Sprouts reminded me of the crusty remnants of some experimental casserole.  Like what's at the bottom.  Why screw with one of nature's most beautiful foods?  The whipped potatoes were definitely whipped - into a veritable soup that looked more like baby food than a proper side dish.\n\nIf you feel like a steak I'd recommend Stack.  Only a few steps further into the casino with a better menu and ambience.  Did I mention that the music was not dining appropriate and annoying?\n\nI just did.
0;I usually give fast food employees the benefit of the doubt, maybe in part because I've worked in fast food before, but the service at this location is exceptionally bad as far as how long it takes the employees to get me my food when I'm the only one waiting there for anything. I always seem to be standing around for a good 10 minutes while they don't quite do their jobs. I won't go back.
0;Not all Taco Bells are the same. I don't know what has changed in the last year or so, but this location is soooo sloooow. Several times I have had to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru after placing my order when there were two cars ahead of me. Today, I ordered a mexican pizza and a potato soft taco and they were both tasting of stale oil. Potatos were dry too. I give up on this location.
2;Refreshing drinks and friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable service.The food is anticlimactic exccept for the chimichurri served with the bread. I got the skirt steak which was pretty much flavorless not to mention tiny.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun though and after dinner there is dancing. More delicious drinks while burning off the boring food!
2;"I have to agree with Dan in saying that the staff didn't seem too excited to be here on the weekend. I came in on a Saturday for a quick lunch before running errands and I was pretty excited after the rave reviews that I read. Unfortunately, as soon as I was seated and started munching on the chips, I was disappointed. They were bland and a bit cold. I didn't let that totally bash my excitement though; I just salted them a little and enjoyed. The salsas were interesting; they were very fresh tasting, but lacked any sort of explosive flavor that I was expecting (The red is much better than the green). With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. \n\nFor lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy. Salsa and a little salt were needed to make my sope enjoyable, and that was a shame.\n\nI would return to El Napolito, but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first."
0;I give them one star for being open. Other than that...service was horrible, they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles. The manager just moved us to the table next to where we were sitting. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was empty!  Needless to say I will never go back to this neighborhood restaurant.
2;Old faithful, no surprises as far as the product goes.  The one thing that surprised me is that they are not set up to take gift cards or the android app.   I charged up my card before i left because I don't like to carry too much cash around.  Oh well.
1;Food ok, but not for the price, dinner for two with 2 watery sangrias was $60! Service was incredibly slow, although it was busy for a Tuesday nite. The staff were running around, didn't look like they knew what they were doing. They should have this figured out by now.
3;"This place has delicious Mexican Food! margaritas are good too, not too sweet :) lots of friendly staff, and great service. I would not go there for Happy Hour though, they are only 1.00 off the Margaritas, and you can only sit at the bar area; if its hot hot you have only half the bar available, the indoor side, But for lunch n dinner GREAT!"
0;There was a huge dead moth packaged with my broccoli stalk. This place used to be great until the new owners took over. Even the bags are cheaper and ripped open on me while I was carrying my groceries up the stairs -_-. But of course, the day I opened the fresh broccoli I had just bought to make me and my son some lunch, there was something black in it. I was like what the heck is that? Cut it open, and a HUGE, black, dead moth was there. Yum. I will never go there again because they are apparently not very hygienic where they package your food. This is my warning!
1;I have two big qualms with this place:\n1) You do not get fries unless if you eat-in. Now really, how hard/expensive is it to include fries w/to-go orders?\n2) The Oakland location CHARGES for re-fills.. Considering they have probably marked up the softdrinks by 1000+% to begin with, I find this ridiculous.\n\nThe actual subs are decent, but I don't find them to be as good as everyone says they are. Overrated + my admittedly somewhat petty complaints above = I do not jump at the chance to go there.
1;Mediocre food. 50$ for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.
0;DO NOT STAY HERE, especially if you have kids.  Substandard amenities.  Rooms are VERY outdated.  Even in the shower, water pressure is next to non-existent.  Pictures do not depict actual conditions at this property.  Went to the business center, found it in VERY poor condition, all equipment taken out.  Property needs an HUGE amount of work to bring it back up to par.  Parking behind the hotel kinda dark in the p.m.  Lots of non-guest foot traffic.  Was told by staff the top floors are occupied by people that live there.  They rent rooms as apartments.\n\nTraded through Interval International for this property, BIG MISTAKE!!!\n\nVERY DISASTIFIED
0;- Wrong directions to our hotel room from the guy at the front desk\n- No room service (No fresh towals etc.)\n- Wifi didnt work very well\n- TV lost signal often\nbtw do not lift up any bottles from the minibar. They will charge you each bottle due to sensors in the fridge. \n\nI complained at the checkout and they took care about the Hotel fees + Tax (56 Dollars something for two days)
2;Snapshot review: Probably a better environment for lunch or drinks vs. dinner.\n\nCame here on a busy Saturday night (with a reservation, fortunately). The four of us were seated promptly at a corner table, which we had requested because one of us was hard of hearing. Good move--it quickly became very loud, and that was even before the band began playing!\n\nThe food was good--two of us had the chicken souvlaki, one had the spinach pie, and one I forget. The service was decent, if a bit slow. Good value for the money, too. I think I would have given it 4 stars for lunch, honestly. It was just loud and slow at dinnertime.
1;Hopefully the organizers will learn from the feedback they receive from this event.\n\nThe lines were ridiculously long - sometimes 45 minutes up to an hour for a few small bites of food.  \n\nI would be furious if I paid full price.  Thanks to Groupon.  \n\nAn event like this can be pulled off successfully - just look at Uncork'ed which probably has 3 times as many people.   I don't think I ever waited more than 5 minutes for food.  All the lines were in and out with the exception of maybe 2-3 spots.\n\nI hope to attend another Night Market but hopefully they'll learn their lessons and provide a better experience.
3;For the price Le Village Buffet is a great place to eat when you're in Vegas. They lose points with me on the seafood presentation as well as the fruit displays.  Oddly enough (for Paris) the desserts needed a little help as well.\n\nThe seafood could have been tastier. The fruit did not look inviting and the dessert table looked too picked over.  However, you must try the custard ice cream - really good.\n\nThe red meat, pork, potatoes, Middle Eastern, Italian and Mexican table stations and presentations were all very good.\n\nTrust me on this one...
1;If it's not one thing, it's something else. \n\nWent there on a Saturday on my first visit. My friend and I were separated and I didn't want to leave without her. She was talking to a bouncer who asked to talk to a bouncer near me so they could help us coordinate and meet up. Well the bouncer next to me a jerk and wouldn't talk on my phone to help. Finally another bouncer saw us getting into an argument and helped me out. So for the most part, still a fun night. But unusually mean bouncer man, you need to get fired. He's shorter than most girls and does nothing but look mean all night. Power trip? I think yes. \n\nSecond time I go there is on a Friday night. Granted we got free drinks. No one was under the age of 35. Nothing's wrong with that, just not my crowd. Not a lot of dancing, more drinking. The evil bouncer was there again, looking just as miserable as he did the last time I was there. \n\nOne plus side was, they had really good music playing both nights. If you just want to kick it, maybe this place is for you. But if you want the wild and crazy Vegas night, XS or Marquee would probably be better.
3;It's a great place to shop if you have a lot of money to drop.\nTheir stores are always stocked with the hippest and most current fashion pieces!\nI bought my prom dress at the BCBG here and I loved it!\nIt was a bit pricey but it was well worth the money.\nI also love their Betsey Johnson store here.\nTheir staff is always very helpful and the dresses are amazing!
2;This is like a fast food asian type of spot. Its pretty good for what it is. Stopped by here one day because it was close to a golf course that i wanted to play at. Think i had the lemon pepper chicken, it was good.
3;Always have had friendly service here, both when we played Tuesday night Team Bingo (and it was busy) and when I stopped in for a Bills game (also busy).  Food is good, bathrooms and clean and they have an outdoor patio. Plus I can pay for my beer with my Bingo winnings! Can't  beat it.
0;All I can say is....If you have been to the Carnegie deli in New York skip this place.  \nThey have no pickled tomatoes, the corned beef was plentiful, but fatty/tough (so go for the turkey), the break was okay, but not great either.  How hard is it to make a sandwich when that is nearly all you make.  Won't come again.  Afterward I heard  from other friends/family that they felt the same way and wished I knew before I wasted my money and time.
3;I wrote an unfavorable review of Elements back in 2010. I am pleased to report that I gave the place another try last night and was extremely pleased with this place! I do believe the layout of the place has changed as it is now very inviting and comfortable, especially sitting at the bar. Speaking of the bar, the 'tenders were two of the most welcoming and friendly people. They had jokes for days and poured a good drink. The suggested tapas were excellent. We're looking forward to coming back on Sunday for their bottomless Bloody Marys that Carla remarked she made a gr8 one. From what I have read below they may have changed owners which could have made the difference? Either way, I'm glad I left my mind open to try this place again. Thanks
2;The salsa here at Nandos was amazing.  I usually make great judgement with the salsa, as I pour a ton of salsa all over my main entrees.  I do not do it because the food lacks flavor, but I do it because I love salsa just that much.  I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken Soup.  I wasn't terribly hungry and I banked on eating a lot of chips and salsa to fill up.  The soup was okay.  I was happy it was white meat chicken, but it lacked some flavor.  I tried some of my friend's rice and beans, and it was a little too salty for my liking.  I will have to give this another try and maybe my ratings might improve a little.
4;Our new favorite spot!!!!! Been here a few times have ordered different things (my boyfriend and I) and have all exceeded our expectations :) Service is great and speedy. Love love love this place!
1;I ordered delivery a few months ago. Their sandwich and fries were good but the pizza was COMPLETELY BURNT TO THE PINT WHERE IT WAS INEDIBLE.
0;TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We will never go back. They couldn't get our order right again. When I told them about it they wouldn't do anything about. We are done. Been there 3 times now and all 3 times has been bad. To have a good successful business you MUST have good customer service with smiling faces. You sure don't see that there.
0;Ok first and last time here.  Tried the adobo fried rice omelette the rice is bland! I also had a custom order made which was incorrect. I told the cashier I cannot have pork in it. Asked if they can substitute the adobo for chicken katsu. He asked the cook and the cook says no that the rice already has the adobo mixture. I'm like ok can you do just chicken katsu and egg omelette? (Since no attempt on fresh rice will be made) the cook's expression was like it was a burden. Really? What's hard of cooking made to order eggs and put cooked chicken in it. Well when I finally get to my destination and hubby went to open his food why was their rice with pork in it? I am very disappointed!
1;"Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night. I'd say that for the amount of money that we spent, we could've gotten a much better meal somewhere else. When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\n\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\n\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back."
1;Great location, amazing customer service! ...unfortunately the food is below average and tasteless! I love Paradise Bakery and hoped to find something similar in the area...I was very disappointed.
1;If Stoney Creek were a mechanics shop, they would certainly be the dealership. Although they are extremely competent and seem to be very good vets, they are very expensive and constantly trying to sell vaccines and checkups and all kinds of other services I don't need. They are also not very flexible. I had a Saint Bernard who got bit by a brown recluse (we think) and the skin turned black over night and began falling off of the leg and rotting. I rushed him to Stoney Creek and they originally refused to see him without an appointment (next day was the earliest). I found this, along with their lack of concern, to be really disconcerting. However, besides that one situation, they typically seem to care. They're also very expensive. They quoted a simple neutering at $350 while my other, equally competent vet in Winston Salem, quotes $150.
3;I organized a no-host dinner here in June 2014.  They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.\n\nThe wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.\n\nOne more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed this restaurant and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people going to visit Vegas.
1;"If you like traditional Cirque shows, this is not for you. There is very little acrobatic or \""strong man\"" performance in this one. I absolutely expected the nudity and \""racy\"" script but I just didn't care for the shows' sense of humor or acts. Neither my husband or I found it terribly entertaining. Just a bummer that we expected more action like a typical Cirque de Soleil. = (\nBummer"
0;I'm sorry, but this is the worst tropical smoothie ever. It looks like a teen hangout spot. I kid you not, there was like 30 employees & I'm sure they were all under 20. They were all just standing around talking to eachother. Half of them were sitting at tables! I've been here a couple times before, buts it's never bothered me as much. I was standing there for at least 10 minutes waiting for somebody to help me out. Horrible! I'm sorry. They need to either close this one down or hire new employees.
2;I'm sorry but i'm so disappointed, with my visit to PNC Park, it's not as cool or as nice as I thought it was going to be. You can see yellow bridges and some buildings from the ball park, oooooh. Not that big of a deal, the stadium is just kind of blah there's nothing really to it, I don't know how people can say this is in the top three ball parks in the big leagues!  I'm not sure this ball park would be in my top 5.\nIt was about 50 50 cubs to pirates fans. Well maybe more cubs fans, pretty sad when the visiting team has more fans at your ballpark. The Pirates fans that are here dont even seem to be watching or even have a care about whats going on. Until the Pirates took the lead. \nThere are some really cool statues in and outside of the ball park. I can't really say any more positive things about the park beside the area is pretty cool.\nThe people in Pittsburgh WOW, you are all amazing, you guys are the nicest people! Sorry I couldn't say you had one of the best ball parks.
3;Played the Lexington Course \n\nVery enjoyable experience. I got a golf now deal for 65 dollars (In May) as opposed to the rack rate of 200+. For the price I paid it is probably a 5/5, if it was 200+ I would probably knock it down to a 3/5.\n\nI was very surprised in the elevation changes not only in the course but in the surroundings. My first Vegas golf experience included scenic views of the strip and the mountains. \n\nThe course itself was moderately challenging with a number of holes having large landing areas but beyond that was trouble. I played with a family who was high handicappers but they still enjoyed the round, even with the number of penalty shots they took. \n\nAs far as the staff I can't give them enough credit. The pro shop and bartenders were very professional and polite. The starter and I carried on a pleasant conversation about the course and other random Vegas golf factoids for about 10 minutes (I actually just wanted to practice putt but he was a really nice guy so I couldn't be rude).\n\nI would definitely come back here for the price as it would be one of the cheapest options in Vegas
3;This place seems very laid back and offers diamond ice (I haven't seen many other places that offer it here). My cousin searched for the nearest coffee place when we were out running errands and found the Street. I would not recommend coming here for coffee (very limited menu), but there are plenty of options for boba, smoothies, and diamond ice.
4;Fantastic vet!
3;The food and service were good.\n\nI'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe.\n\nAlso, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show.\n\nEverything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.
4;I have been coming here for years and always share this spot with my closest friend. I usually have the James Bond and the Japanese Lasagna as they are a couple of my favorites. I also have had the rolley rice and ask for extra ponzi sauce...yum yum! The screaming orgasm is wonderful as well as the Something Wrong#7. They don't have an all you can eat here which would just put them over the top on my opinion but may put them out of business. They seem to do quite well and are always very busy during lunch. This will continue to be a spot I come to.
3;"I love Angelina's pizza. The pastas are pretty good but the pizza is what really stands out here. The prices are reasonable as well. Only thing I would change is the servers/cashiers. Not too friendly in my opinion and kinda come off as the \""we-don't-really-care\"" type. If it wasn't for the service, Angelina's would definitely got the 5-star treatment from me.  The $8.99 pick up special which includes a 16 inch one topping pizza is my type of deal.  Killer pizza always keeps me coming back!"
3;This is a nice, clean gym with a pool and brand new treadmills as of 8/2014. I left You Fit due to the lack of child care. My kids love the Kids Care here, they play a movie, Wii and seem to have a good time playing with the other kids. There was a mixup on the enrollment fee as my kids seemed to pay one too since they are enrolled in the kids care but apart from that I do like the gym. $30/mo and that includes the Kids Care.
0;This buffet reminds me of Golden Corral which I can go to for a third of the price. It is dated and dirty. Everything seemed so unhygienic.  I had a hard time eating much. The food was overcooked and dry. It did not seem very French at all. I would not recommend this place at all.
0;Wow people in this store are rude. I was in there exactly 2 minutes and was shocked at how rude the print lady was.  Not gonna go there again.
1;I have been to this restaurant twice, HATED the food.  The last time I went I had a great bartender. I can't remember her name, but she was good. Too bad the food couldn't live up to the service. Very poor quality menu! Great weekend drink specials and service, but food SUCKS!!

4;The service here was great!  The food was even better, though.  It is comfort food, but done so well!  The sage fried chicken tastes like you're biting in to Thanksgiving.  The side of salmon that my friend ordered with her salad was huge and delicious.  It was better prepared than what she had at Craft Restaurant the next day, and it was a fraction of the price.  These people are clear about what they want to deliver and then do it with excellence.  Well done!
0;Unethical billing practices.  Prices more than double area dentists for same procedure(s).  Billing office initially refused to bill our insurance for procedure until I called the insurance company and had them contact Tatum Creek to inform them that as a provider they are required to bill every procedure.  Even after they were paid in full, they then continuously kept billing our insurance company for the procedure they had already been paid in full for.  Once again I had to call the insurance company to file complaint.  Also, the staff is rude -- when we initially had billing questions, they would never return our calls.  Regarding dental care, Dr. Lamborn blew off an issue my husband had, telling him that it was fine and could wait, but when he went to a different dentist, they told him that it was an urgent issue and could not wait.  Tatum Creek Family Dentistry -- WORST dental experience ever!!!
4;I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person.
3;Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Can't really ask for much more. I'll definitely be back.
2;I went to this location today and found it to now be Dori's Bakery.  I met the owner/baker and she is very nice.  She gave me a sample of her chicken salad and I loved it.  She has baked goods and also sandwiches and soups.  She said everything is made fresh.  I had just eaten over at the Peruvian place in the same center but plan to go back for a soup and salad, maybe a pastry or cookie.  Oh yeah, she has quiche, too.  And cheesecake, but I don't know if is the same kind as this place had.  I would have liked to taste theirs after reading the reviews.
1;Ok why does the gate have to be like a million miles away?  I swear that tram ride gets longer every time I go.  When you get there, it seems ok.  I guess the anticipating of getting to the strip has you distracted from the fact that it is a long way to get out of the airport.\n\nOn the way home, everything is miserable.  The long walk to security.  The horrible long lines, even when I flash my badge to go through the express lane.  The ride on the tram seems like you gone a mile to get to this 3-story escalator.  When you get to the top you are greeted by restaurants that makes your hangover worse from all the greasy smell in the air.  The only good experience I had was getting bored from a delayed flight and slipping a $5 bill into the slot machine and winning $87.00, 10-minutes later.
3;one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.
0;I placed the order for coworkers birthday. Order successfully went through and receive a confirmation email. The next day when the order was supposed to be delivered to our job, they never showed up. The online check is a joke and is inaccurate. When I called the next day to cancel the order, the order number was completely wrong and was mass confusion. Then they went on to tell me they tried to deliver the arrangement but the business was closed. Which was untrue because the business didn't close till 10 PM. Had to haggle to get a refund back. Didn't receive an apology or any compensation what so ever.
3;"I think many people haven't heard the old \""you get what you pay for\"" quote. \n\nThis is the perfect place to stay at if you're going with a bunch of broke college students (who shouldn't be spending money in Vegas but that's besides the point!). It's in the middle of the strip (right in front of Caesar's) and it's not as bad as many people make it seem to be. \nRemember, you're in Vegas, you're not going to be in your hotel room for much of the trip! \n\nI've stayed at the Mirage and the Venetian and they were a lot nicer than Imperial Palace but it seemed like a waste since we didn't spend that much time in the room. 35 a night (thu/fri) for a place to pre-game and to crash out is perfect! \n\nIt is what it is, a cheap hotel that's in a great location. People in here must be disappointed that their cheap Kia doesn't perform like a Ferrari."
4;Just found out they serve tacos. They were really good! Pleasantly surprised. I will definitely be back for more.
1;We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\n\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\n\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\n\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\n\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel.
4;"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.  Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.  While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had.  Anyway, I can't wait to go back!"
4;"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues."
4;Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.  The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.  The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!
4;"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, it's how we recover from them that is important""!!!  Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)"
4;"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.  This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!  It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!  As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist."
4;Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
4;The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.  Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.
4;Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
4;They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.    The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
4;okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!
4;This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
4;first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!
4;I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
4;I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!
4;Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.  That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
4;Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!  TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.
4;(Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!
4;Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.    Did you catch that?  DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
4;Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...  Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.    In the ghetto?  Check Has sweet tea?  Check Has no-nonsense, quick service?  Check Ridiculously long wait?  Check Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check  I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.  If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
4;This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.  I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.  The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.
4;This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.
4;This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.
4;I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!
4;I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.  The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.  The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )
4;Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
4;Beer...or Yoga?  Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.  Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.  Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.    That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.  As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!).   So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.  I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in.   Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending:   NAMASTE!
4;Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.   First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.  If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.  The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)   Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.   you will not be disappointed.
4;I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!
4;So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.  Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.
4;Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
4;"I LOVE Chic Nails!  I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.   The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!  P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)"
4;After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!
4;Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!
4;Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
4;After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix.   If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.
4;It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.   If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
4;As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.  As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!
4;"'twas the night before booyah and all the through the city people were piecing  some pretty shitty costumes together at savers, good will george w bush clintons, bill and hill jay-z & beyonce biden and obama even saw kanye oprah, super mamma yep, octomom brad pitt & jolie and men as madonna and lynn sue cooney  i went to Easley's to see what they had of course, it was madness every kid, mom and dad crammed into the isles pulling on wigs vampire masks and noises of pigs all being assisted  by the yellow tee'd staff so very helpful no panic, just laughs ""yes we have liberace in fact, we have two try both of them on i'll grab 'em for you"" they found me a boa a wig and make up took just fifteen minutes case opened and shut and all around me this repeated itself the people rolled in pleased people rolled out into the darkness parties around town wonder how many were out gettin' down in get ups from Easley's i'm guessing a ton so check out Bert Easley's make up, magic, fun bright yellow building south side of mcdowell since nineteen sixty four makin' halloween, howl"
4;"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!"
4;I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.    Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.    Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.
4;I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!
4;That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.   The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not.   Service was great.   I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)
4;Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.
4;"I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant."
4;"I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the ""hole in the wall"" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!"
4;"Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well, it just got it.  This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.    Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.    Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more."
4;Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
4;Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!
4;"This place is fantastic!  We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe.   Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night.   This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.  We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!  Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!"
4;Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.
4;"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, it's an adventure!"".   We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!   I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!  The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)"
4;I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.
4;Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
4;Where to begin?  This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.  Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.   It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.  If you haven't gone... you're missing out.
4;I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...  The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.
4;Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.  Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.  Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!
4;Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!
4;The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
4;"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.   Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials   They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!"
4;"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite.   Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."
4;"Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.  It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.    Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.  I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say ""it's organic, don't panic"".    Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!"
4;Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that!   Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).  Nice laid back decor too.  You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.  I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!  I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!  The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)  I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!
4;Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done.
4;Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.
4;We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!
4;Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?
4;I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
4;AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.  You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.  Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.  They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.  Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)
4;Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.
4;Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.
4;A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!
4;"I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a ""glorified Red Lobster"").   I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food.   The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying.   I can't wait to come back here."
4;On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!  PS GET THERE EARLY!!
4;"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that ""I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour"" feeling.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.    I am hooked!"
4;I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
4;Excellent service and food             enjoyed live music on patio
4;Love Krista!
4;I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!  Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!  Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!  So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
4;"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...  AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!  Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?  This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.  You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer."
4;Love me some hidden house!   The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
4;Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.  For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!  I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!
4;Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.
4;What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.
4;I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly.
4;Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
4;Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast
4;Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!
4;Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
4;"We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try."
4;I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!
4;The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
4;OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day...   The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course.   Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake?   Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.
4;What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )
4;Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile.
4;I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
4;Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties.   Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.
4;This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.
4;This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.   Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.   I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....
4;Great service
4;My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.
4;The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.
4;I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.  Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!  Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!
4;"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.   there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!"
4;"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know."
4;"The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :) This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)"
4;What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.  It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.   The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it.   The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.
4;So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills.   I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
4;After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots.   As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)
4;I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.    In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.  My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.
4;As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!
4;Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!
4;Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!
4;This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.
4;3 syllables for this place.  A-MAZ-ING!  The best Phoenix has to offer.
4;I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
4;The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.
4;Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.   I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.   Breakfast:   Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.   Lunch:  Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.
4;"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.  Ok, I'll wait.  Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!  We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.  Awesome place!"
4;We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.
4;Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!
4;I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!  My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.  I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!
4;Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
4;It's the place to be.   I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.  Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.  My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal.   We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.  Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.
4;Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.
4;This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.  Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
4;flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour.
4;I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.  The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.
4;"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the ""boneless buffalo wings"" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu ""the Wendy's pickle sandwich"" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is ""the big WAC"" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!"
4;This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan. I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot. Get the pedi, no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else. Have fun. I do..Customer service - top end. Thanks
4;"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!    Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top.   We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.   I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.    Thank you Jason and Switch."
4;New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!
4;"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.  I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:  Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."""
4;RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!
4;I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!!   If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.
4;I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!
4;Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks!   Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.  He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.  Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????
4;There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yragui's Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.    Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.   It just doesn't get any better!  Carol Taylor-Tassone Erica Elizabeth Tassone
4;I have been here many times, pretty much can't go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly.
4;"As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied.   I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!    Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet."
4;"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!  They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food.   Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon!   Check this place out!"
4;LOVE the food!!!!
4;I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.  First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him.   The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?   The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.
4;These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great.
4;"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16"" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."
4;"I love boba drinks but hate the word ""boba"". I always feel like an ape when I say that word.    Anyways.  There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.  I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good."
4;I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.
4;Love it.  Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.  It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.    When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.  I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.  Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.
4;My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish.       ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!
4;Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!    They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.    They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.  The clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!
4;Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!
4;I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.
4;If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50) have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...
4;Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.  A short review but you get the gist of it...
4;WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !    That, and it's cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today they'd be gone before I got home.   I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and it's up to you to refill them.  Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that it's all so fresh and local!    Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.  If you're paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  I'd been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if it's worth the tip - or how much of a tip it's worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly.
4;"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."
4;Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
4;I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.    I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.    The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.  I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.
4;I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)
4;Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.
4;"It does not get much better than this, fellas.  BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.  Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.  Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday.   Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.  It definitely has a ""Cheers"" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.  Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007."
4;I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!
4;"Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try!   Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of.   Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge ""by the glass"" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!    The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them!   My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!"
4;Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...
4;I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
4;This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
4;Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!
4;Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.  The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.  The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.
4;Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.
4;This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.
4;Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.  Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.  Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.  Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.
4;"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"
4;"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!  Drinks 1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.  2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.  Food 1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing. 2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them."
4;Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.
4;I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.  Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.
4;Phenom.  The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila.  Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice.  It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be.  The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made.  I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.  Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Service is friendly and quick.  I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.  Good food. You won't be disappointed.
4;Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations.   We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.  The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating .   Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .
4;These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.  I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.
4;"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
4;Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!
4;Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!
4;I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.  We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!
4;The best gyro you will have in Arizona... or maybe anywhere.  Love the grocery selection. Everyone there is really nice. And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
4;I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.
4;i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.
4;Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!
4;Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue. Ingredients are local and super-fantastic. Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork, buy it immediately. Don't miss the rice pudding.
4;"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.  Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.  The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.  A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich."
4;"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!"
4;This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good.   I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.
4;Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.
4;Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?
4;great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular
4;This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner.   This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.
4;I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
4;Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.
4;Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
4;This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!
4;The BEST of the BEST!  I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.  Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.
4;One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!
4;After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.    I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).  Highlights: Tasty drink menu Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style Great part of town Sexy servers...dang  Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!
4;Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.   Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.
4;Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)
4;Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.  I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.  With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?   Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.
4;Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
4;"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular.   Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city.   Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.  Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.  And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.  NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny."
4;I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.
4;I love you, Marquee Theatre.   Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed.  I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job.   I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there.   The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks.   All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.
4;Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!  Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!
4;"FINALMENTE!!!  Andiamo....  FOOD -------- Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.  Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"".   And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.  The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette.   And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.  As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table.   SERVICE ------------- Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table.   And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them.   SETTING ------------- I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually.   The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked.   I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe.   EXTRA CRIB NOTES ----------------------------- * the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego. * It's great * Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip. * it's great * No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda).  * it's great * complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself. * it's great * It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for? * did I tell you it's great?  ALL IN ALL --------------- An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all.   I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.  And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)..."
4;This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.  I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.
4;"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend.   Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training......   Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.)   What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food.   Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty.   Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot?   If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories.   Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states.   Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.   Give it a chance....see if you like it."
4;Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.  Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.  I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.  I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.
4;This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.  Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.
4;"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!  Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!  I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture!   There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.  Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.  And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.  As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!"
4;"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.    The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday ""brown bag"" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.  Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.  @iamtimhardy"
4;I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Don't get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.  They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap, but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials.  I don't buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation. However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well.
4;Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!
4;Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.
4;Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.
4;"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all."
4;"Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.  The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.    This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.  The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection."
4;"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.  We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.  However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.  Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient?   Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.  [* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]"
4;"I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.  While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!    I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?  I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.  I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office."
4;The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
4;Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!
4;Excellent burger
4;Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
4;I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case.   My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.  It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.
4;I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.
4;"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.  My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)  Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!  We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.  Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.  We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.    The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!"
4;I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.
4;"Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.        I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.       Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.        Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza   Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!"
4;I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!
4;It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.
4;Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).  I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.
4;"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.)   I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical.   the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?)   the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.   The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)  If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.   What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!"
4;This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.
4;CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.
4;Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.  On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's.
4;The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!
4;This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!
4;After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.
4;I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.  I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...  The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.  The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.  There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.  There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.  A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.  Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes.   Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.  There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever.   I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.  Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!
4;In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.
4;We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town.
4;This place literally just opened.  I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)
4;FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant.   This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.  Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.  In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)
4;I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.    Pros -  1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in. 2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal. 3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town. 4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better! 5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good.  6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.   7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.   8. I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!!  Cons - never having to shave again, darn.
4;Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
4;This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to. The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help. The other day, I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas.
4;"I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.  We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle.   I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).  I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops."
4;I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)
4;Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!
4;Here's the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.   My friend was right.  Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.  No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.   The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.   Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.  PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2.
4;Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
4;The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!! TV's everywhere, if you love sports and beer this is the place for you!! The nob has events all week and food specials to go along... the ribs are amazing!! however the GYRO is good as it gets!! The best gyro in the valley you can write that one down!! and the wings... once you pop u just cant stop!!  HOB NOB SPORTS BAR & GRILL cheers to you!!
4;Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service!   Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!
4;I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :)
4;Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
4;Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!
4;Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus, I highly recommend this little greek hot spot. They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food.   The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food.
4;I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
4;"My husband and I enjoyed a ""staycation"" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends."
4;Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.
4;Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!
4;"It's a beautiful day.  Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning!  What to do?  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.  Woo-hoo!  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?  We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.  It was an excellent choice.    ""This is awesome!""  my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail.  Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.  Five year olds get distracted so easily.  ""Is that a wasp?  Look at that hover fly!  What kind of ant is that?  What kind of beetles live here!""  asks my little future entomologist.   We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!  My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.  Such a sport!  ""Let's come back here again.,  That was fun!""  It was fun for us too!  We're so lucky we live not far from here.  It is a very well maintained park.  As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.  I highly recommend you check this place out."
4;"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well."
4;Tiffany @ the chanel counter.  Tana in the lingerie department.   these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room.   but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)
4;"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."
4;I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering.  Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!
4;"Ice Ice Baby... Ice Ice Baby...  All right stop collaborate and listen; Ice Now is here and it's got my attention  Make some drinks - not warm but frosty; And believe me when I say they are not costly Will it ever melt? yo I don't know. Give them a call and they'll show To the extreme I yelp like a sandal; Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle ... Ice ice baby  PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...  Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.  And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!"
4;I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
4;Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!
4;Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
4;Wow.  Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.    I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn....   I know where I'm going tonight.
4;"Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business!   Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for.   I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!"
4;Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.
4;Covet is an excellent clothing store. In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop.  unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you.   Acne Jeans? check. Endovenera? check. Ksubi? check.  Nike? check.   Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section,  continues with an excellent men's clothing selection,  and finishes off with excellent women's wear.   It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.
4;Love, love, love! Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect. The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing. I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu, and it was all delicious. This is my fave place in the country right now. Can't wait to go back over the holidays!
4;This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
4;My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!
4;I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.    My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!    I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!     Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!
4;Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable.
4;I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.
4;I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)
4;An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.  There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.  There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.
4;Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.  Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted.
4;Sushi ken I love you so much, I don't even know where to start! It's about time I write a review. This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.   Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A. Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you, please just don't come and spare me your stupid review, just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that. My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks, I feel like the staff is our family. They are very nice and polite. A lot of families here, restaurant is decorated simply.  Nigeri and sashimi are very good. UNI here is amazing! Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad. From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl. I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9.
4;Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.
4;"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.  In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.  The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.  The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.  There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."
4;I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me.   I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
4;Evil Place!!!  That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!  All joking aisde, I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.  To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.    You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!
4;I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!
4;I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.
4;I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!  Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.  I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now.
4;I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!  The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!
4;Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?
4;Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.  Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.
4;I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!  Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!  There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!  This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)  Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)
4;When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled.   Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs.   Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay.   If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.
4;LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.
4;"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)  I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.   The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?  For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)  I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"
4;The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great.
4;"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.   "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
4;Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!
4;I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing, free parking.  There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.
4;The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.  The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.
4;Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos.   You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in.   The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance.   Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.  We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.  For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.  We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.  For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.
4;Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place, which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good
4;Just because i feel like doing something different. :P i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...  Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here I said the truth is here the truth is here  I want more Give me more We want more God damn it I'm back to demand we get more We want more I want more and more and more I want more We need more I want more God damn it I'm back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more  [Verse 1:] I stand here naked as the day I was born Face to the dawn and my faith in the song Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me It's got to be allowed to breathe Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee I want more than what your offering me Songs that make me feel like I'm already free I'm a rebel in my own right Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me When the game need it I'm exactly what it need Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be  [Chorus: x2] I want more We need more I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more  I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is  [Verse 2:] Not nearly a single solitary soul Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand Until then the big man is gold Got one lone reason to go on breathing Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching Just to pull more out the core of the deamon The people need to see them pure human being Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain Little child running wild striped to the raw veins Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain Sacred war dance suspended in the moment We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe  [Chorus x2]  [Verse 3:] Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul Not bought and sold, not all controlled Bring a little fire when the world get cold Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold People need more freedom Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em' Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake I demand you start listening to the crowd If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground  [Chorus x2]  I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is   the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!
4;One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.
4;Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much. If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.  Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.     If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.     Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....
4;I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.  I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.  While I was in Anthem this week, I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.  By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.
4;"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
4;Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one.
4;I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there.
4;This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
4;"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.  Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.  When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.   I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day.   To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.  I love this place and hope I always will."
4;Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
4;I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale.   Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.
4;Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
4;I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.  P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up.
4;I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)  So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.
4;Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc).   When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping.   If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go! If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more.
4;This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
4;"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)  Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!  For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!  Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.  Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening."
4;I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.  My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey.   I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.
4;This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.    It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!
4;Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.  I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!  I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!
4;"OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. ""Is Lee's gonna be there?"" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon."
4;If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!
4;"I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.   Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy."
4;"Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, ""I need to stop there."" Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!"
4;"I love me some Dobson Ranch.  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!    As far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.  A great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars."
4;Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.  The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.  The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).
4;IKEA is so much fun. It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs, couches, beds. I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home. They have very good prices on all household items. When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something. Simple things such as Tupperware, trash cans, bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price.
4;This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.    Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.    Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.    We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense.
4;Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
4;My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!
4;We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms.
4;A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
4;My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way.   I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches.   It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.   After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.
4;"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.  The Service My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.  The Food We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner. For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy. Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture. After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.    Atmosphere We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash."
4;I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!  I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.  Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:  Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado! Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50 Udon - Good!  The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.  Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too.
4;Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
4;"I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.  Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out. I had at least one of the following: Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up. Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also. Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt. Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho. Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top. Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!  Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.  Failing that, I rounded up!"
4;I love this place.  The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello, customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.  You won't be disappointed.
4;"Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the ""smart"" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!"
4;Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.  Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!
4;Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven.   The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting.  Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.
4;"Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient.   Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that.   I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.  Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of ""wiz"" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome.   Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave..."
4;The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale.   Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows.   The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.  [For further information, please visit: http://phoenix.gov/BNDMAPS/index.html]
4;Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!  The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!  I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!
4;I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.
4;"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.  This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.  Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.  On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.  Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too. I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when ."
4;Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'  This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.
4;"Another great Italian find!  My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!  When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!  We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.  ****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!  In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine ""Northern Italian Cuisine"" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!"
4;Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
4;Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.
4;I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff. Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a big,clear picture of the baby. Also, the  large spacious rooms are really nice. On a side note, they have great products to buy in the lobby.  Now pregnant with my 2nd baby, my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds. Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds. I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks.
4;"We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a ""tell"" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again."
4;we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.   The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!
4;"I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.  The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed ""Boston"" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.  So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.  The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.  What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving."
4;"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating."
4;Nic-nacs galore!
4;"After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.    This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  It's worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails (""The Last Word"" and a ""Pendemums Club""), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes."
4;What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.    The Room was very clean and very comfortable.    Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.    The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.    The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.  The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.    Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy,
4;Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.    Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)  Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.
4;Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.
4;Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.
4;This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular.   Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.
4;Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!
4;"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal.   Although the food is not ""challenging"" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here."
4;cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You
4;This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.  If you like buffets, do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!!
4;Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?
4;My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.
4;"I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life.   I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat.   An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here."
4;What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving. The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation.
4;Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-))  Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19
4;I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time.
4;Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.
4;If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
4;Best donuts I have ever had.
4;Considering my experience with a previous dentist, I was hesitant to try a new one. But my experience was absolutely the best.  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!! They are professional, friendly, and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.  Most people dread going to the dentist, but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!!
4;Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.    My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!  Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!
4;"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been ""bad"" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference!   I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!  Thanks Laura!"
4;Just the facts re: full dinner experience:  Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable. Service: perfectly charming, informative and attentive. Drinks: I don't drink, so read every other review for a review of drinks. Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth. Great flavor. Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors. Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.  Crispy onions, mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end. Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut  on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple, beautiful and tasty.   Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.
4;Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!
4;"I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new ""brow lady"" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!"
4;This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.  They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!
4;In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh, but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!
4;No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream?   Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location.
4;"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)  1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!  Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...  Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.  #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar  Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.   Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.   # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal  Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.  Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.   # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami  Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.  Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.     Coconut Ice Cream: Yum  Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.  Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.  I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.    Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV  Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?"
4;I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.  Foxy eats Evanger's, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.       A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  I'll never get my dog food anywhere else.
4;So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.
4;I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.  They also refill propane tanks.  Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)
4;"Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!"
4;Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible. I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense.   Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!
4;Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!  Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.
4;What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.
4;Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)
4;There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
4;I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.
4;Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.  the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great!  Amenities included: 1. pet fish (that someone else fed) 2. complimentary granola for the race day 3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool) 4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up 5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels) 6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them 7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol... 8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at 9. dog friendly 10. heated pools  love it!  I will stay here again for sure..
4;"This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.    To finish off the night, head down the street to ""The Sugar Bowl"" for fresh ice cream!"
4;I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!
4;Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
4;I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.  The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.
4;I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.
4;I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count.  Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances, Coupling, RedDwarf, Antiques Roadshow, NewsHour, Nova, This Old House, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Frontline, Horizon, Scientific American Frontiers, The War, As Time Goes By, Red Green. Plus, tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon.  (I don't think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)
4;I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.
4;Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
4;"I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.   I LOVE it!   I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.   The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!   My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)  Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!   I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!   Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!"
4;So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though.
4;Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends.
4;"I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;("
4;"WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not ""stuffed"" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.  I love this place!  It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more."
4;great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
4;"This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many ""Libras"" (Pounds) and you want them to make it ""Preparada"" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!"
4;Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.  Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....
4;Dilly Dally My Willy Wacky By The Rue  Why do I always forget this place, When deciding on where to eat lunch, Here I could really stuff my face, It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.  My wonderful, tasty Honey Do, Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat, Add a slice of cheddar for you, This sandwhich cannot be beat.   Located not to far from the hospital,  So you get a great crowd of nurses, The hotties who come here are pivotal, I'll stay until the crowd disperses.   Get the soup in a bread bowl, Or a bag of chips if you please, Add a cookie for your hole, I'll say bless you after you sneeze.   Bottom line is you cannot go wrong, You'll love whatever you order, Go home and hit the bong, And then make a run for the border.   DEEEES NUTS!!!
4;Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.  The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.  The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.  This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area.
4;"I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing!  My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were ""the king's"" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you, Ariel!"
4;Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!  We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking.   Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
4;I agree with Tracy, my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's. Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley. The service is great and the food is delicious. Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area, but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.
4;Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery, but think again!   SIt outside on the small patio area, ck out the GR8 crepes! savory, breakfasty, sweet - u pick or choose!  Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.   I luv the chicken, aspargus, basil, feta :-)   Mmmmmmmm.
4;Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.    There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.    I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.
4;Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion.
4;A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.
4;"The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas. The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)"
4;"I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there!   Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine.   I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of ""shockingly"" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car.   Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location."
4;"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.   The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place."
4;Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.
4;This place always pleases! Their sandwiches are always great, bread is great, pizza is AWESOME, and their short ribs are great. The food is SO fresh! The waiters are kind and friendly. When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream, she kindly told us the freezer broke. I heart the deli!
4;Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
4;Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
4;Great for young kids... tons to do and see
4;Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse.
4;Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.
4;I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
4;"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.   We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.   The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.   Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.   Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!"
4;I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice. For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)
4;Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
4;Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.  Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.  It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.  Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.
4;The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.  What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.  One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.    The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.    What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.    If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
4;In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.
4;"Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu.   As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!"
4;Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.  Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.  And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).
4;Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment.
4;Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
4;Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
4;I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child.   My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off.  I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.
4;"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!  Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.  It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy ""organic"" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving ""all-natural"" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.  I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again."
4;Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.  I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.  The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).  The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.
4;Still solid, still delicious. I love this place!
4;I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.  In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.  I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.  The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.  Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday.
4;"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
4;Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...
4;Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable. They Say Nothing But good things
4;Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.    Hooray for pleasing the parents!!
4;Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.  I freaking love Nordstrom!    The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly.  I have never had such good service anywhere else.  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.  Aside from the service, the selection is very nice.  I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!  I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.  They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.  Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.  If you go, go in June or  January when the sales are great!  Make sure you check out the shoes!
4;While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.    The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.    If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House.
4;My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.  My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.  She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.  Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.    This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.  And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.  I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.  During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.  These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.  Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.
4;When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!! HATS OFF FOR FnB!!
4;WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!
4;Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales.
4;I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended, and if I'm ever back in town, I will visit again.
4;It was 3:45pm and I'm about to jump on a bus to the light rail.  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: they're 26th in line.  So in theory, at 5:00 we're in the first seating.  And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, we're sitting down and waiting.    Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window?  So I guess the point is, if you make it your only point to go to Bianco, it's hard to be disappointed.
4;Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
4;INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!
4;GET. THE. CIDER. Just do it. I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had. Not syrupy sweet, and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction. Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas. Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best. My favorite is the vanilla. The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy.   The sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich, and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip. All have been really good, but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)! I love it so it was no problem for me.
4;I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.
4;Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)
4;They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.    We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.  The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.  My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.  I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.  One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.   Will definitely return.
4;NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.
4;Great tasting frozen yogurt, excellent customer service, very clean inside. Healthy choice for a sweet treat.
4;If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
4;"I can't say enough good things about this place.   Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.  But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.  The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito."
4;This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.  It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone.   The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.
4;So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
4;Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.  I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.
4;I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.  If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.
4;"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...  The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.  P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
4;Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.   This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.
4;Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.
4;"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here.   Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!"
4;How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?  The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out...
4;"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out. Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)"
4;I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.  I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!   The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
4;Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!
4;"Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ. Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!  It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a ""mall"" restaurant. A MUST go!"
4;Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!    This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!  On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.  For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!   NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!
4;So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
4;"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department.   When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new ""parents"" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home.   To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense.   While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit?   This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets."
4;Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!
4;Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion.   At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.    Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once.   No fee to enter. Bring a camera!
4;Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.  It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.  My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.  Don't feed the wildlife.
4;I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.  She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.
4;What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.  What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it.
4;Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!
4;It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.
4;Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.   The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.  *****UPDATE*****  Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....
4;I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.
4;Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
4;Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.    It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.
4;The best bar in town.
4;I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.
4;"Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those ""$99 room"" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on."
4;Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.  That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).  It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier.
4;This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
4;Yum best donuts in Phoenix.
4;Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!
4;This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.  Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!  I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.  The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!
4;We decided to eat here on a whim. My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger. Both were fantastic. The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time. The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing. For $27 it fed our family of five. I'm definitely going back. Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and clean. Thumbs up all the way!
4;I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight.    This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.
4;"One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire ""patio"" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids."
4;Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
4;Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!
4;Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!
4;I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.  I am SO GLAD that I stopped. I was pleased the moment I walked in.  The store is well lit and cheery, the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.  Also, he offered his community room for my book club!  So nice, very friendly, definitely the kind of place we want to encourage.
4;The best gluten free pizza!! Absolutely loved the avacado pizza. So delicious. The wait staff was great, very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.  Parking is limited, but certainly not an issue to complain about.
4;"I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night."
4;The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
4;I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!
4;Great service by Angela and their Doc First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact Very enjoyable experience and very quick Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away Definitely recommend
4;My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.   We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.
4;Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.  The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.  The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.
4;This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you.   I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased.   This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.
4;Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
4;This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karen's Kreamery Cafe'. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business... Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you haven't been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!
4;All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.    ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.
4;This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG. Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.
4;I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?  -The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.  -Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.  -The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.  -I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.  And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.
4;Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.  I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.  Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.
4;Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
4;Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.
4;Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.
4;Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.  Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!
4;Always love the ALofts If you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the same Rooms were clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room in the standard king room Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice. Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do. All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one.
4;I have always loved this place.   Good Food, fair price,  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.  All around good place..   its a go to .
4;Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service. Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility. All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.   The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!
4;"I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!   When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.    We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!"
4;probably my favorite restaurant :)
4;This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
4;This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!
4;"If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an ""endless"" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.   In a word: perfecto.  Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona.   But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here.   Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey."
4;BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.  A few tips: 1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want.  2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious. 3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.  There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.
4;Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.
4;I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars...   Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!
4;We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.  As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!  We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!    Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!
4;Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!
4;I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.    Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!
4;I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family!   I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!
4;Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!  The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!
4;I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the food is good, too!
4;Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
4;After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!   I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!   Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite
4;I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out.   Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!    $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.    It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!    Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!
4;"Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said ""OMG!  This is so good!""  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, ""Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch.""  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future."
4;I don't know what I would do if this store ever closed.  It's right near our home, has an excellent selection of both wine, meats, and produce.  Note that wine is mentioned first... I can't help it!  The service is always really good too.  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.  I got over it.  :D
4;I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!
4;My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat. I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's. I am so glad I did. I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful. The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so, so nice to me and my kids. He was very clean and professional and courteous.  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company. I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them.
4;Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect.   As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed.
4;Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!
4;A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!
4;We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
4;Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.
4;What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended.
4;My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, I'm sure it's worth it!
4;The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.  They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.
4;Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
4;great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.
4;Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back.
4;One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
4;"When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) ""a kid in a candy store.""   It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!  The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).   Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!"
4;"This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's.   Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.  It's one of few places I go to with ""stuff"" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.    Keep up the good work."
4;Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys! They make their own bread onsite, which is to die for! Love it. Hate the valet parking.
4;Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate.
4;Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special, not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!  I'll definitely be returning :)
4;This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine, relax, and enjoy some great food. Their service is amazing. There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating. You could literally spend hours here. They have wi-fi, so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad. The bar super cool. Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating. Their wine is killer, of course, or they wouldn't be named 5th and Wine right?
4;Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!   The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy!   Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!   I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.   My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously!   Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!   Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!
4;I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
4;The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!
4;By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck.   Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.
4;Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.  Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.  And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.  I'll be back.  Not soon enough.
4;"Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said ""we must go there for lunch one day"" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a ""higher end"" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!"
4;This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
4;"Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street.  Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant. My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious.  I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )"
4;My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!
4;Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
4;Best Steak Ever. That is all.    Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now.
4;"in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review.   this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.  the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced ""mah jer lees"" like i had thought.... it's pronounced ""mar lees"". so let me get that out first.  i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc.   being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:  a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.  the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons  the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view.   so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter.   oh, and GO PACK GO!!!"
4;Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!
4;I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!
4;"Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.  It worked out perfectly!    Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did, and it was just as good as last time!  The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time...   Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the ""hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.  Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?!"
4;It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine.
4;Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.
4;I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her...
4;This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)
4;The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!
4;everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!
4;"I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little ""Good Job"" on Yelp!"
4;This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was.
4;Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar.
4;We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA.
4;Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.  If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.    ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.  Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.  Go!  Now!  And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.
4;This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet.   The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!
4;"Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale. Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs. WOW. The staff was friendly, have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person), and the food is...beyond good. Having only sampled the uber nacho plate, which is by the way, as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness, I can definitively say:   Best.  Ever.   I give this place the highest marks for ""doesn't suck"""
4;"If you ever want to instantly ""up"" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky ""open"" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.  No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix."
4;This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress.   We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet.   The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy.   Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...
4;Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.  I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.   By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.  The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.  I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!
4;This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!    It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!    I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!  Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!
4;I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.
4;I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy.
4;"BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ!   No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying ""with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?"" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.    The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go.   Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes."
4;This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations.  I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D
4;What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!
4;"Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!  While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a ""bar area"" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on.   The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!"
4;Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table.
4;Careful! You'll get addicted.  Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.  The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!
4;"I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her ""List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends"" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.  As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!"
4;"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.  It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said ""Ben?"" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.  I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.   Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.   FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out."
4;"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"
4;Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!
4;YUM!  I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
4;Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.
4;Yelpers,  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting.
4;"May I add ""family friendly"" to my past reviews? We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here. The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms. The manager, Kaj, literally treats us like family. We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out, and we were thrilled with the level of service we received, as usual. The food is excellent, and the service is divine. The happy hour is awesome! My favorite items are the quesedillas, burgers, feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer, and the excellent selection of beers. Corbins is just an overall  great place!"
4;I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
4;Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for.   On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.  Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!
4;I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better.
4;This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.
4;I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.
4;Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
4;One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :)
4;I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.   The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.   The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
4;Yes... I love Eegee's... I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic. If that isn't love I don't know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know. I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and don't forget the ranch fries! The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.
4;"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations."
4;The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.  I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-  Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor.   Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg.   Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.   We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.  Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.  The service we had was phenomenal.  The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!
4;5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space.
4;Lux is a great place for coffee, bakery items, bites, and even cocktails if the occasion permits. The people are friendly, and it has a great atmosphere.  I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch. As I don't live in AZ, if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time, I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.  I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.  The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.  If you go for the first time, don't be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there. Maybe it's your hair. Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly. Whatever, dude. Be brave, press on. It's worth it.
4;I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.
4;My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there.   My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.
4;"This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the ""salsa bars"" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.  If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas."
4;I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D   The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.  The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!   My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!
4;Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong.   High quality furniture and very low prices.
4;I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment.
4;I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
4;Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.
4;"As a previous reviewer stated:  ""This restaurant is like no other"".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.    First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.  Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!  We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!"
4;Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.
4;Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!
4;Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!
4;This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:  Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.  Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.  Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.  recommended Food: Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus. Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty. Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended. Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few. Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example. Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.   Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.
4;I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!
4;Great food. Great ambiance. Great for a night date on the patio. I can't wait to go again.
4;You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!    I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!  The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.  The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.  You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.
4;Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing!   We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste.   For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it.  The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it.   The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.
4;I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?  Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?
4;I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there.
4;What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
4;Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
4;Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
4;"Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots.   The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless.   We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss ""Dr. Love"" commercial comes on.   yummmmmmers."
4;"This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome and of the good ""Homemade"" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now."
4;ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!
4;Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.  On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.
4;Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)
4;Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.  It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.  What a deal!  Under 5. bucks including the drink.  I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.
4;Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!
4;I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(
4;Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!! I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it...
4;Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....
4;After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.
4;I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.  They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.  I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.   Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.  Chompies is the best!
4;This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week. Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!  The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!
4;Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.
4;I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place.
4;What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!
4;unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream..   Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!
4;I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.    The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.    They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!  Enjoy
4;"Y'know, rarely do I buy the ""extended warranty"" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary.   In the case of tires, I have to make an exception.   You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway.   For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow.   The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds).   Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT."
4;Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!
4;Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious.
4;I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...  I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!  Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!  Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...  I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!
4;Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
4;Amazing. Romantic!
4;Absolute greatness!!!  Service: friendly  Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this) Kung pao noodles Vegan chilli fries  Ambiance - A+  Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.   Go next door to nami for dessert!!
4;Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.    Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.    The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.    Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)
4;Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.
4;Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.    I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.    Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.  I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.  I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.  Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.
4;I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect.   For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :(   Enjoy!
4;I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.
4;...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.    Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.
4;I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!
4;Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.
4;Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.   We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.
4;The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.
4;Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
4;still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!! -- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-
4;"You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like ""sonoran"" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup ""hot sauce"" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog."
4;i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant.  2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again.  this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along.
4;I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously.
4;I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'!   While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner.   In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out:   - The very friendly staff - It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses!  - Clean decor  - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see  - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside.   I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.   Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!
4;"Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto ""sandwich"", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!"
4;My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!
4;Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
4;Love all their dishes!
4;To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!    Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.     Other than that, what a great place to go!
4;This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.  The cost is very low - $5 per adult.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.  Also, the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.  Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central.
4;Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.  The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.   Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
4;I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!
4;Great customer service, nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona.
4;Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate.   We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.   Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.  We'll be back, and with more friends.
4;"Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend."
4;This place is great!  I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.  The place wasn't open yet, but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.  He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.  Sure enough, at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.  When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big, comfy chairs.  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.  They massage your face, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, feet and calves.  The they tell you to turn over, as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.  It was just wonderful....and all for $30!  I definitely recommend!
4;i miss this place so much, it's insanity.   ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.
4;"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried.   Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).  Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that!   Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean."
4;Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!
4;The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!
4;I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.  Great strore!
4;There are 3 choices at ASU for game design. Which one you choose depends on why you want to study game design.  1. Polytechnic = Games are an engineering problem. If you are interested in the engineering of games - go there. The college of technology and innovation http://interactive.asu.edu/?q=hom  2. Tempe = Games for (Education, Medical, Legal etc) They are closely tied with the education department and the Games for Impact initiative. http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/  3. West = Games as Art (Fine Art) If you want to explore games as a medium and art form this is where you want to go. You can either get a BA -http://newcollege.asu.edu/harcs/degrees/majors/interdisciplinary-arts-and-performance-program or a BS http://newcollege.asu.edu/mns/degrees/computing/applied-computing-program
4;Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!
4;Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place.
4;Why am I trying to hide my love...  I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes, it's totally convenient.  But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!    I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!!    You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.  Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!
4;love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey
4;I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied. This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it.
4;T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!  In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.  Anyone up for a burger?
4;I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.  I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.  The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.  Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.
4;I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better.  I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.  So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
4;I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.
4;I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
4;Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.    When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.
4;I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream.   There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical).   I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar?   On and on it went.   My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal.   Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.
4;"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too."
4;The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!
4;Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!    Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!
4;Championship establishment here.  I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.  They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.  The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).  Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.  I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.
4;This place is amazing! The food was delicious, the waffle was like no other.  The service was great, very attentive and nice. I will be returning.
4;We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.  Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice.   The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.  Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!  I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.
4;Postinos on the East side!?  Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough  You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos   Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!    Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind  I can't be saved  4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave  If there's some left for you  and don't mind if I do   I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos  I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!
4;Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:  #1 Perfect fish and chips. #2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.  They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.  Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.  The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night.   Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.
4;One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.   I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!  I eat the entire plate every time.
4;Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.
4;What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.
4;love. Love. LOVE.  How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano. And that's exactly what a music store should be. It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist.   First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience.   They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.  Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.
4;"What else can I say that hasn't been said already?    I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!  My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for ""more "" for the first time at the store:)  I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order"
4;LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!
4;Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
4;"I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.  I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!  Service was friendly and efficient. _______________  Update:  12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious  12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.  12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!"
4;No need for a long review.  Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.  Great Food Great Customer Service  Love this place
4;I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!
4;Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.  Visit Date: 11/18/09
4;LOVE this place. Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.  I love this place, and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)
4;We loved this place.
4;One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
4;Love the wings!
4;Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.  As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.
4;Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!
4;Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! G  The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!    Really enjoyed and will spread the word!
4;Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
4;While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
4;I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.  This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around.   I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.
4;"After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated.  The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.  We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the ""Madonna Special"" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.  During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course.   Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!"
4;They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai.   If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!
4;Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.
4;This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.
4;Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
4;I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.    The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.    There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!
4;This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.  The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.   Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out...
4;"Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his ""bedside"" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!"
4;Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place.  P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool.
4;"I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip.   It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?  Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said ""SURE!"" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? ""SURE! But be careful it's hot."" And oh so YUM!  I think they deserve the taglines ""Have it your way"" and ""Any way you want it"" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said ""No"" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.  Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.  But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.  My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.  I'll tea back REAL SOON!"
4;We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!
4;As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars.
4;We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!
4;!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!  My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!  Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!  Here's what we had:  ~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.  ~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado,   ~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.
4;I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.  I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.
4;Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.
4;In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley. It is just a great place to hang out, set-up your laptop or read a book. I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno, a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet.  We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum! I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse. Amazingly, for our second time there, they recongnized us! WOW!  I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley!
4;Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.
4;best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood.   i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.  the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.
4;this place rules, plain and simple  just wish they had a cheaper jukebox
4;There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list.   I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.  At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out.   Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point.   When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.  Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership.   The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!
4;I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!  The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.  The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.  The service is attentive, but not intrusive.  An absolutely divine dine!
4;"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After  Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez.  My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time.  When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"".  And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"".  Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar.  At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed!  So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!"
4;OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.    The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.    The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.  I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.
4;Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.  Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.  Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase.   They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!
4;Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up.
4;If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well.   In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it?   You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.   We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.
4;When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)  The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable.   So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.  Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!
4;Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.  The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers. A few things I'm not so crazy about: The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting. The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box. Enough grousing I love the place and go often.
4;"I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, ""You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats..""  Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.  Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.  Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.  Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!  Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars."
4;"I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!  It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.  How do you say, ""Damn that was good!"" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).  The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.  There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.  It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!"
4;"I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the ""S"" coffee store.    One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine."
4;Very good place to eat.. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people, they always interact with their customers. I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want. I highly recommend this place.
4;Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!  Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far.
4;Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.
4;Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.  Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.  Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts.   My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it.   They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust.
4;My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!
4;I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.  Detail:  Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.  I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.  It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.  Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.  This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.
4;Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free.   Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum.   How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.
4;Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.  first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them, try them here, yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck, because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!  seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch! plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps. the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria. on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!
4;Durants ROCKS.  I love the red velvet walls. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant. I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it. I love the steaks. I love the decor. I love the bar.  We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.  I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.  It's amazing, delicious, and very very unique.
4;I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead.
4;Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.
4;One of my most favorite coffee shops! Location for sure. Soooo cute here. Inside and out. The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment. Coffee is pretty darn good. Not the best, but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...
4;I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
4;I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.   This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.   This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.   So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.
4;Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
4;If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all!   The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!   I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice!   I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!
4;Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!    Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!
4;"Amazing cheesesteak.  One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.  The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.  That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.  Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive."
4;I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.
4;I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...
4;Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me. I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.  I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.  I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.  I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.  After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great
4;Been here twice. First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup. All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of. I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again, they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said. It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!) If you have car problems, need a check up, or need a second opinion, they won't steer you wrong (pun intended).
4;This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.
4;Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5  I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.
4;I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...  I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!
4;Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.  I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.  We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.  I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.
4;I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.
4;"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes.   Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.  Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?  But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who.   And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
4;"Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the ""bikers"" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best."
4;R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.   We will be going back!
4;I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time, and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!
4;I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.
4;The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.   The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing!   I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on).   I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.   I highly recommend El Bravo.
4;"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the ""peacemakers"" were before us!    Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!  Bravo Thirsty Lion!"
4;This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...  Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book!   This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)
4;I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
4;This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.   Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.   If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!
4;I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)  The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).    We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.  We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.  We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.  Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.    I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:  1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.    2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.  Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!
4;Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.  I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)  The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?
4;This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
4;How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.    The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!  I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.
4;Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.  Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.
4;Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.
4;They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.  Bonnie Wills
4;It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all. I love it here it's clean, great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!
4;What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service  I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.  I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  I'm thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking.
4;short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack.   I can't wait until they come back!
4;Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.  She was totally spot-on.  These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.  I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.  I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!
4;I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?  To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street!   I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!
4;First hole in one on #3. I'll always love you Vistal.
4;I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service.  Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet.
4;The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back.
4;"As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!  I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.  They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.  Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again."
4;I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!
4;I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip.   Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.   Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
4;Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.
4;Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
4;I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.  It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.  Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.
4;This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
4;The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.  The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.  I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so.   Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.  EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.
4;This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!
4;This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.
4;I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
4;Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.  So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.    The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.  Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.
4;We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!  Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.   My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!  This is what Rubios is about!
4;This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.
4;This company is Awesome!!! I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon. I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable. They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world. The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt. I will be visiting quite often. Thank you so much! John Paul D.
4;This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.
4;Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
4;Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun, easy and worth every penny.
4;Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often.
4;Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!  I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.    I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!  I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!    I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!
4;Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.    Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.    I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.
4;"Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for ""decent"".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!"
4;First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.
4;This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.    Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.
4;I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.
4;I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order.   (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No i'm not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.  WAH!)     Oh, and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.    Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself, just indulge.  :)
4;I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.  We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.    We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.
4;As good as I always remember it to be. Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)  Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.  I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..  Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries (in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)  I would eat here every day if I had the option.
4;Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.
4;"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.  Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.  Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.  At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.  If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.  Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon."
4;I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling.   Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces.   There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.   The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.  It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them
4;Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.  The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.  Q
4;I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
4;My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular! Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!
4;"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.     My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)     I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!    Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.      Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?      The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.     I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show""."
4;Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.
4;"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!    I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!    I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)"
4;"I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to ""turn the table"".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!"
4;I am a hot dog lover.   For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.
4;Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.  The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.  The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.  Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.
4;Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year.
4;What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.
4;Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free. One last thing, they have free wifi!
4;"Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!  Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!  The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!  The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!  I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an ""Asian Sangria""? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!"
4;Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
4;What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!
4;The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business.   Go double. Add bacon. Park at Circle K if in a hurry. Plan on holding it until you get home. Stick to the burger and fries, genius.
4;So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.   I read the reviews here and decided to try DV. You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place! There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.   It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations. I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too. She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper. She was quick but *really* methodical.   I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX! She even called me by name throughout the conversation. $25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all
4;Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)
4;My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.
4;Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.    Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.
4;Loved it! Best French toast ever!
4;I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.
4;Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.
4;Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good
4;This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.
4;"Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.  Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my ""work attire.""  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.  Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!"
4;Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights.   I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet.   I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it!   Bon Appetite!
4;LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film critics today????
4;For so many reasons, Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department. They are equally as stellar! Dr. Tieu is super friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. The retail part has the best pricing on contacts, frames and lenses compared to any competitor. Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates. Always ask about rebates for contacts, both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!
4;Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos. That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu. Great hangover food. The staff is always very friendly!
4;Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.
4;"My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldn't put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough."
4;This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
4;Good food
4;"Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since.   I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the ""basic"" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise."
4;Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
4;"I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it."
4;FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience. I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside!! I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request.  I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity. The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds. The atmosphere is definatly trendy, After I finnaly soaked it all in, I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar.
4;"Better than Starbucks anyday!  The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as ""The Annihilator"".. My personal Favorite: ""The Cookie with a little raspberry"""
4;Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close.  It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!
4;Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here! Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat). Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite. Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz.  Excited to go back and try some more pizza!
4;"I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.    There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.  I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.    Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended."
4;WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.    We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.  Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.
4;Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.  I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.  OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!  Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!
4;We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice!  - Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio. The decor looked fresh and new as well. Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less. - Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live. - Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well. We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance. Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table. Kinda liked eating at the bar better. Yum of the drinks.  - Great trip....great place...we will be back!
4;My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.
4;I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.  Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.  I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?  I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.
4;Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!
4;We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries.   We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice.   My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.
4;Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go.   I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.
4;This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!
4;I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
4;For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting.
4;John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
4;The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since... Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.
4;"If you're at all a ""Foodie"" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.  Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.   This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.  Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service."
4;What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.   So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.  And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.   Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.  PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories...
4;What an awesome business! Friendly, knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in. I can't to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed! Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you. Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience. Oh, and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops... I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D
4;Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.
4;Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.
4;bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool.   plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.  it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent.   the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...  if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.  customer service is very nice and helpful.
4;"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry.   I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it.   Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.   The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.   I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar."
4;Bobby Q is GREAT! We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!! Blooming onion - just right! Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!  Our waitress perfect - Go - now!
4;"This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.  There is just so much beautiful, wonderful, amazing fabric.  I dropped a pretty penny- but I've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects.  The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.  It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard.  If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with, they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say ""get your paws off my fabric"" which made me chuckle.  Maybe I'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that.  Despite the somewhat sketchy location, 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!"
4;Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
4;I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS!   Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.   Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.  There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves.   The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box.   I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!
4;Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
4;I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star.   We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.    They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.  We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.    We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.  Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.  Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )
4;Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!
4;My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!
4;Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff, great food, great times.
4;In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!  Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.  Highly recommended.
4;I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.    The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).  I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.
4;Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!  Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!  Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)  You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.
4;"My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out, so I got in touch with Brad.  He was very professional throughout the experience, and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.  Punctual, efficient, and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive, and his work is worth every penny!  The office looks brand new."
4;Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.
4;Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
4;Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming!  Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service, sweeping, clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right, but they are great at communicating.  One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing what's going on.  They always take the time to explain what's happening in a way I can understand.  Broken pump or filter? No problem! They do repairs too.  They'll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change, or how to handle those pesky, pool destroying, monsoon storms!
4;Two words for you. Mouth.  Orgasm  Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.  I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.    We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come
4;Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.
4;Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.  The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.    For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.    Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.
4;"Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.  After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.  Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home."
4;I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience.  The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!  Some are saying it's too expensive? I think it's worth it.
4;Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.
4;The service has always been really good.  I love LOTS of things on the menu. The dixie pan fried chicken is great.  There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.  The Del mar salad is great.  I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.    Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES, let's go there!
4;"A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about ""being taken"" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop."
4;"Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've""ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds."
4;Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.
4;How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.    I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...  Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this -   Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)
4;Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.
4;Great Job!
4;Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!  Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!
4;The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale
4;Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back, just get it on my own.  Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.
4;We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded.   This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.  The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain.   There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.
4;I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!
4;"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a ""hot dog"" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than ""a hot dog"" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog.   Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie...   My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!).   You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?"
4;Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.   1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour. 2. NO BAG FEES.   3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price. 4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it. 5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.
4;i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.
4;BACON, people!  Spicy Italian sausages, brats, even heirloom veggies by the pound?  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.    I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.  We were quite pleased.  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats, cuts, and preparation.  We grilled up everything that night - the sausages, the brats, the veggies... even the bacon... because, why not?  I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.  I can't wait to head back over for round 2!
4;Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)  It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too.
4;I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.
4;Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds.
4;I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.  My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes. My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.    For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.  The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.  I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.
4;OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed.   Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.  The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd.   Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...  Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!
4;These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
4;Super!
4;Best value for your money,   Clean, comfy beds.  Quite.  Great breakfast that is included.
4;They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.
4;This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.    The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!
4;Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.
4;Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer. If you want yours well done, ask. You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit, and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.
4;This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.  Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com
4;"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.  Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery ""rub,"" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner.   The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.  My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale."
4;My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.  I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!  My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though.
4;"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food.   Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!.   We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving.   We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) )   After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as ""cajun-style, but not overwhelming"". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce.   The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert.   Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.  One comment: The ""Branding"" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it ""Dominick's"" or ""Lincoln Avenue"", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)   I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!"
4;Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.
4;Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe.   Be Back soon need some work done
4;I am a huge fan of this place. I haven't ventured outside of the teppen tables, so my viewpoint may be limited. The atmosphere is quite loud and lively, but definitely fun. It is great for a nice dinner with a group. The food is simply outstanding. The soup, salad, and chicken are all excellent, but the fried rice is the absolute best. I have never had better fried rice anywhere. After you have enjoyed the main course, get the green tea ice cream. I hate green tea, but for some reason, this ice cream is amazing.   If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana, definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.
4;I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities.   Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!  I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.
4;We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.
4;Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going...
4;Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
4;Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done.
4;Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!
4;If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.    From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)  The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.  The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.  _C$
4;It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour. Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience. You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome.
4;Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.  He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.   Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.  I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.  I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!
4;"I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.    Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert."
4;Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
4;Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever!   but it was just perfect in ever way!!!   They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food....  its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :)   my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!!   i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing)   WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share....   My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine   we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....   all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...   i cannot wait to come back!
4;Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.  My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  She's five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.    In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.  The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.  It's pricey. But so very worth it.
4;LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.
4;Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
4;I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when I'm in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous. The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think it's a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes. The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit. I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost. The staff are pretty attentive.  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush. I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12.
4;I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good.   Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes!   P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)
4;Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems.   She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals.   I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat.
4;"If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by! The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the ""cookie monster"" which is awesome!)"
4;I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place.
4;"The waiter got the drink wrong: ""up"" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was happy about the mistake, The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.  Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.  I would definitely go back.  Good service, great food, fun atmosphere.  Great flexible hours on a Sunday.  GO !"
4;We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.   Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.    As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.  Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!
4;Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.  Things I've tried there:  LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.  Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!  Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.    Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion.
4;That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot.
4;"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.  Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.    When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.  I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.  Overall, it was a very nice experience."
4;Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special.
4;Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.
4;I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!
4;I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
4;Unfortunately Out of Business.
4;Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)
4;This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.  I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.  Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.  The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!
4;I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio
4;Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!
4;Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!  But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.
4;"Absolutely incredible. It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go-to front-desk man everyday for this shop. He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didn't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really weren't in need of! I brought in two pairs of dress shoes; one of which I had the heels replaced ($22, free shining included) and another just for shining ($8) and they made them look near-brand new again! I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs/cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop!   Keep singing,  -Jerron"
4;I'm a regular at Lux. Haven't reviewed it out of sheer laziness. And it's usually laziness that brings me here: when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it, I pay the price with an all-nighter, which I like to start at Lux. (Damn them for not being open past 10). This is usually the story when anyone spots me here.   I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte. When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee. Mmm.  Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course. Like every 3 minutes. Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it. I'm not making that up. Like half my music collection was created through this method. The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras. I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own.
4;This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for... Anyways...their menu... The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off... Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it! The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!
4;I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
4;I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was. I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom. Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great. I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others. I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day. This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!
4;I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.
4;I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!
4;Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that.
4;"I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S. here for her awesome hair transformation (8 inches is a lot, girl!) I just had my second hair cut here today, and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around. First of all, the service is top notch - they take care of you quickly, kindly and enthusiastically. They are not snobby, which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale. I have always felt welcome and comfortable here.   Moreover, the prices are amazing! I have very easy and basic hair, and they charge me $45 for a hair cut - if you want to spend more, you certainly can, but I am fine with the ""stylist"" level (who charges $45). In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce. This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon. They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while.  I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley. This place knows how to treat customers, style hair and create a pleasant experience. The Market Street location is a bonus, too, because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new 'do."
4;"How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable ""grocery"" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)  After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!   The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.  I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!"
4;"I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer.   If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:  Appetizer: Calimari Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken  Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie  FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations."
4;Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...
4;We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix.          Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it.
4;Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG.
4;"Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful.   No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really ""date night"" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks.   You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.  The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?  Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin."
4;Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.  And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.
4;North Glendale's cool new  hangout.  Formerly Cactus Willy's.  Completely remodelled!  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!
4;Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.
4;The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!
4;My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!
4;My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time. I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo. They firefly room is utterly transporting as well. Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon. I strongly recommend a strolling date here. Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free. Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower. Its free if you exit from the north side.
4;This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.  The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.
4;I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.
4;"My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to ""please, sit down, be at home"".  Awesome.  I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.  I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.    I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!"
4;"I am disgruntled by the reviews I have read about Sapporo.  I have a few things to say.  1.  I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.    When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there. I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.  2.  I understand wait time may be an issue.  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.  Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?  The food is well worth the wait.    3.  Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing ""rude"" service.  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.    Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant.  In my opinion, Sapporo serves the best Sushi in Arizona."
4;Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination.
4;When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!    Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Can't beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, don't sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!
4;I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
4;This is our neighborhood restaurant.  Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch. I never disappoint.
4;The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world.   All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully.   They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think.
4;As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..  And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer ! Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good ! They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .  Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha  Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.  Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !  Rock on ladies !
4;Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!
4;Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best.
4;Got to love the concept, coffee, art and a co-work space friendly for start-ups.  OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft.  The coffee is good, the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they don't harass you, I couldn't ask for more to get work done!
4;I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them.
4;As a regular shopper of Last Chance, I must equally love The Rack. I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up.   At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full. I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here. They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though. Last week I found the greatest find! I found the best pea coat ever! It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place. The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off. Score! Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter. Haha   Check them out. The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn't. There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well. :-)
4;I thought this place was outstanding! The staff was awesome, the food was excellent, overall appearance of restaurant was nice!
4;We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!
4;Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.
4;Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too.  The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman.
4;I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!
4;"I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.    First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.     That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.     The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...     Eat here. It's really that simple.      Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it."
4;Great Italian food with portions designed to share.  And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!
4;Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state.
4;i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended.
4;Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.
4;If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!
4;I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.  (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.  Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.  She is so good with the wax that she doesn't need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.  (Granted I don't have very um, complicated, eyebrows).  She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her.
4;Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!
4;I've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and it's free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product I'm loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesn't clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when you're first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want.
4;When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind? No, I'm not talking about a salad, I'm talking about an ice cream sundae!  Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled:  Basil Lime Sorbet Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie Dessert Honey Maple Pecan Almond Buttercrunch Cashew Turtle  All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious.  My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing.  The service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's.   I'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go. It was so yummy!
4;Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.
4;Good food at a good price.
4;I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside.
4;So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.  Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!  Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.  The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.  A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.    Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.
4;I absolutely love their personal hotpot room!  I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again! Their item portion is big and fresh!  Only downside is that there isn't any sauce that is pre-made... Other than that, this place is AMAZING
4;I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing!   Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!   And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!
4;Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.  IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park.
4;"I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.    The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, ""What is this place?  A cafeteria?"".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I took quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.  Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.  Nothing tops this.  Anything you order is amazing.  Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.  Soft and melty and so so good!"
4;What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!
4;Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!  I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
4;So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared.  In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.
4;I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue. Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more. What is that demographic exactly? ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities. Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right.  Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights: The margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.) The chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious.  The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones. The ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale). To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place.
4;Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!
4;Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!
4;"No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun ""home"" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously."
4;Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!
4;This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.
4;"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.  The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.  The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own."
4;We had a great time. Had bottle service with Katie. who was super friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday. The music and atmosphere were great.
4;So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!
4;I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch!   The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)
4;My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.  Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.  I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.  The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.  In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.  BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!
4;Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.
4;Excellent food! Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try. I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food. Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.
4;"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."
4;Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  Definitely recommend coming here!
4;"We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."
4;"I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be ""New school"" or ""Traditional""   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating.... I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family."
4;My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea
4;HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!   What a sexy course this is.   This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!    Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?  It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.  A real private club feel.  As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!   No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.   Don't be afraid to lay up.  :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer...   Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.   The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.  Nice rough, but not too tall.   A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.   The greens were also perfect.   Nice and fast, and TRUE!  Ok, I'm done gushing about this course...   Give it a shot, you won't regret it.
4;very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable.
4;We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back...
4;Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!
4;I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...  Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.    For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.    If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.  I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!
4;I LOVE Kona's happy hour. Amazing deals on great sushi rolls, and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service. I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants. None can compare to Kona. Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it. I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito. I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality.
4;Wanna try it? Now is your chance! One more day of this LivingSocial deal: 12 days for $49  http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/453990?ref=email-jp&rpi=85154658
4;Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
4;I love this place. I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied. The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice. I'm so lucky to live down the street! Tons of vegan options, too.
4;I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.  Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.  If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.
4;I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard. They've completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic. They have made huge strives in their water skills. Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson.
4;You want to go to Four Peaks. Trust me.
4;"We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly."
4;Dr. Kanarish was exactly how I expected he would be by the other reviews I read on Yelp and Google. His staff was very friendly and the facility is extremely clean. I have an 8 year old Boxer that needed a large tumor type growth removed from his paw and was given very high estimates from different hospitals. Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal, stitches, etc... ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called. I was originally offered care credit( a payment plan) but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason. I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic, so we will see how the next few days go. A great first experience and am planning on transferring all our future visits to see Dr. Karanish. It's great to see there are honest and compassionate Doctors around. I hope anyone looking for an exceptional Dr. will consider Dr. Karanish.
4;I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.  I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.   I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!
4;Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again.
4;First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the A's during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  What's not to like?
4;"we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu).   for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing.   the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining.   i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth.  my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful.   i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride."
4;I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)  1. Nobuo at Teeter House. 2. Fez. 3. My friends in various parts of the valley  and   4. Mekong Supermarket.  I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.  Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar.   This place has it all.  I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.  To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want.   Make the trek. You won't regret it.
4;"Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!  The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.  They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.  I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!  Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.    It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's ""chill"" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.  It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!  Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!"
4;I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again.
4;OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food.
4;"Went there last night with no expectations. From the beginning to the end, including the ""bread basket"" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals I've had in years. Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit. Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable. This place is a model for how it should be done."
4;Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad.   I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy.   The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth.   I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!
4;"3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, ""how long"" and with much joy he replied, ""I can get your food in 10-15 minutes"".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!  Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change."
4;"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!"
4;Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy  ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!
4;I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!  Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.  Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)
4;Michael came out today and he was great! Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila! It seriously opens with 1 finger. He was quick, affordable, knowledgeable and very nice. Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind. A+!
4;Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!!  I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.  I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.  I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!
4;This review is pretty much for the bra department at Nordstrom. They are amazing at their jobs. I finally found out that Victoria's Secret is that their bras suck!   So I bought a bra online to pick up at the store, but when I went in and tried it on, it didn't fit. I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently. I told the sales girl, and she asked me if I minded if she measured me. I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room.   When we got in there she told me to take off my top! I'll be honest here, I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt, and I almost peed a little. I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger, and just took it off. Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation, but she probably did, oh well. I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying.  Well guess what? That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out! The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras. She came back with two of the most wonderful, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever owned! So instead of getting one bra that day, I got two.  I have to say, my hat (or my top) is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs, and for having fabulous bras.   Ladies, please don't bother buying another bra at Victoria's Secret! Run to Nordstrom next time you need a quality bra to support your girls. :)
4;I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done. Kind of disappointed, but oh well.  So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.  When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.  When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)  When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.  Great customer service, and very good food.
4;I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time.
4;My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert. Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine. Great place to catch up with friends. I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up.
4;This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).  I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.
4;Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.
4;I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
4;I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)
4;been coming here since birth
4;Well, what a pleasant surprise!  I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!  Congrats Dave and Payton!
4;It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!!
4;"There's the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like ""its on me."" and took it from his tips! I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that! I LOVE this place!! :D"
4;Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing.
4;BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. They're newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!
4;I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... I've tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :)  Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that I've ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend)  It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but I'm still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive I'm honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! i'm a believer :)
4;"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  Good: 1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen. 2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area. 3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself. 4) Cool decor both interior and exterior.   Bad: 1) Bed pillows were too squishy.  2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue. 3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.  Ugly: 1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really ""ugly"".  Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit."
4;I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce, and it was unreal.  Cute little place.  I didn't sit to eat so I can't comment on the service, but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out.
4;One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my great-grandparents, one of which was Filipino. The food! Yum!!!   It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food. We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley. The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market. Pancit? Lumpia? I was beyond excited when I saw the truck. Yes, I get excited about good food.  Everything was fabulous. I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious.   Service is great, prices are wonderful. I will definitely be back.
4;"Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)"
4;This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.
4;"This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.  We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement ""bar"" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement ""tables"" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up!   Great job, Peoria!"
4;"If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!! My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (It's Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)  If you have not heard; ""Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!"" Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US!  Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!)  ""Can you believe the balls on this guy!?""  We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!  The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out!  I have them on speed dial... So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!!"
4;They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months. It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!  There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing! The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change.  Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place.
4;"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.  5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:  ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors.   ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all  ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal  ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.  ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.  ***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***"
4;LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!  The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly.
4;Awesome food and service!
4;How did I not know this is right across the street from my house??  I woudn't describe myself as a crafter or DIYer, but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers, from traditional to fun and contemporary! I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from. The best part is that they were only $3.50!  They even sell Japanese Copic markers, take that Az art supply!
4;Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!
4;Delicious gourmet crepes. Friendly staff. Awesome environment. Price is right. Eat here, it's good.
4;Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food. Pearl is an exception to the rule. The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock. I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good. All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff. Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like. Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive. Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable. Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
4;Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
4;This is one of my favorite bars in the area.  The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive.  The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets.
4;I had an amazing facial here!  The space is clean, inviting and relaxing. Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded.  After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing!  They offer many of different services including laser treatments. I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)!  Anyway, the staff is very professional.  Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!
4;"Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens. I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight.   ~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed. ~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude!  ~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven.  ~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix!  ~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal.   All items served ""tapas"" style... great opportunity to try many items!   Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame.   ~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced   ~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine!   ~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good!   ~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp ""hushpuppys"".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion.   ~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian ""slaw""   ~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces.   No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.    ** Personal Suggestion ***  Have a food allergy ?? .. Use common sense when dining. Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering."
4;I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!
4;Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes! Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner.  We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe. With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an a subtle breading on the zucchini. We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun. Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week. My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger.
4;Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.  I found the decor charming and elegant.  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit.
4;This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!
4;Simply the best Ethiopian I've ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.    I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.    The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back.
4;Very impressed! $5 pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value. Free valet parking.  I look forward to coming back.
4;This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)
4;This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!
4;"Amazing work!  My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her.  I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable.  They treated me like a patient at the hospital.  They were my angel nurses.    When Dr Amin came in, the ""nurse"" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe.  I was, of course, shaking like a leaf.  The Dr ""popped"" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb.  When I say ""popped"", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little.  (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek)  It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time.  I just breathed through it, and it helped.  After about a min, the Dr was working his magic.  In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals.  And I didn't feel a thing!!  :)  I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did.  I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done.  Plus if you're a scardy cat like me, this place makes you feel comfortable."
4;Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.  Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?
4;This place is great! Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road.  ...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!  ...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!
4;"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.  What is a pasty?  A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.  At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.  Pros * Good food * Originality * Portions * Customer service * Coat hooks at the bar  Cons * Small interior"
4;Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!  Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes. Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well. They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors. I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection. The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable. and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!
4;These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses.   We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!
4;"Truly a hiden gem in Chandler. Located south of Chandler Boulevard, just off of Roosevelt (next to Archery HeadQuarters). Wanda's is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and 5 outside. Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold. Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-15 minutes during the ""rush times"", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains. The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, it's breakfast all day, lunch from 11-2 during the week). The burritos are awesome. Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home! My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy. The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece. French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you won't be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete). Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual.  A+ Wanda!"
4;"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side.   For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!  There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)  Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!"
4;Sundae for Sunday.  Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
4;This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars.
4;Half the fun is the wait.....If you are going to go, you may as well get into it. We get into it, at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine. L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings. I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall. Just kissing, but hot, if you lose earrings.  We went twice once alone, and the 2nd time with her sons and friends. We ordered every pizza imaginable. It seems almost every high end pizza now, is brick oven and more about the crust. I like everyone else will mention, I am from the East Coast and know pizza. Best in the United States, we have several that are at that level. You can flip a coin on which one is better.
4;Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though
4;Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?  WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.  Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!
4;Nello's is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place.  You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order.
4;When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements. It was marvelous. The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation. They lasted for weeks. I am really pleased with this company and wouldn't hesitate to use them again!
4;"I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches. I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad. Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled ""The Dali"") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!"
4;"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.  I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.  You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.   On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.  The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.  Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.  Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.   The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."
4;This little taco shop gets 5+ stars!   The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home.   I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50.
4;"I like to think of Trader Joe's as a ""specialty food/health market."" It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison!   With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!    Some of my fav's are:   $3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find!   The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid ""Ready Egg"" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!!   Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a ""low fat/fat free"" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a ""little bastard."" That name CRACKS me up!)   And although I am not a ""sweet"" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable!   It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.    If you shop more than once a week, you can ""earn"" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )  Regardless, this is just a great little ""market"" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)"
